Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the national assembly, the proposal to change their title in 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) will be reduced.
The reason for this is to change the name of the National Assembly in 'Welsh Parliament' (Walish Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of the mockery.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name "with "Twp" and "Pwp" is rhyming".
For non-Wallisian readers: in Welsh 'twp' stands for 'doof' and 'pwp' for 'Aa'.
A national assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the whole group was "not happy" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between 'MWP' and 'Muppet'.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Body), which is currently drawing up a law on the name changes, said: 'The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, with the members themselves.'
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which gave broad support to the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of members of the National Assembly, the World Parliament Members (Welsian Members) or WMPs panel preferred the most support at a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to suggest alternative options, but a consensus for the chairman, Elin Jones, to present a draft law within weeks could be a problem.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of national assembly members and on the design of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote on their names in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, voters decide whether to change the name of their country to 'the Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The referendum was set to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the same name as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is based on the Greek territory and has repeatedly spoken against its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
'Today, both of them are no longer.'
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"The social life of people today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood in which people regularly find themselves."
At the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the Church leaders assume, and that they will "be at the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with dwellings where people who do not support the remaining havens.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy dwellings in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but as the father Johnson's parishioners planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell play.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and successor to St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the bell in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had changed 18 years ago to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, partly drawn by the lay leaders of the Church and partly by the diocese of Bishops.
In July, the parish council, consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the council, although it was not involved in the commission of the architects and contractors who had been sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai hurts in California 13-year-olds while diving to Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving to Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the station KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, listening to the boy's help cry and paddling with several others to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought first that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was screaming “I’m bitten!
I have been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been torn up.
“I cried out that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked access to Ponto Beach in Casablad for investigation purposes and for security reasons for 48 hours in Encinitas.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, which, however, are largely not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks on cosmetics departments that are supposed to be filled with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
As part of a large advance to the 2.8 billion pounds UK-wide cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and household sales are falling, the larger cosmetics departments are being tested in eleven branches throughout the country. If they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use shops previously used for television, microwave and household appliances.
According to Sainsbury's, its range of cosmetics is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are given more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is launching a re-launch of its make-up series "Boutique", so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test at two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in south London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local commodity stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to fight the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food articles.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has been established in hundreds of branches of Argos sales outlets and also a number of Habitat sales outlets. This has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, but after a discussion of the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets ended.
The new strategy follows on Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the favorable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases that call into question the current type of shopping."
Peter Jones "sudden" after the retreat Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” Den’star Peter Jones is “wounding” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons" Den" star Peter Jones by their very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "enraged" when the "golden girl" of television admitted at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday during a tense discussion, to stop devoting enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand Truly due to their new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and probably doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retreat from Truly to Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure its future in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the market launch.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost millions of people due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market introduction.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added as Chairman in March.
The couples spend the vacation together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
One Jones nearby source said last night: 'We don't comment on his business affairs.'
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He was concerned about the criticism he was expecting from the news media for a comment some would consider 'non-Presidential' and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news moderator:
'I didn't give up.'
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the de-nucleisation negotiations have become a reality.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the highest diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "correspondent response" to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted that the US was holding back sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump showed much more optimistic in his rallying speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of rocket tests, support in the release of hostages and return the mortal remains of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes ruin an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of human lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for mobilising international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not require international support, so that's a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian official assessment of the situation in Palu was based on whether international agencies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquake that Indonesia has to face constantly, the country is unfortunately badly prepared for natural forces.
While in Aceh tsunami shelters have been built, they are not a daily sight on other coastlines.
The warning, which, despite a warning that had entered into force, obviously was missing in Palu tsunami, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands are already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lombok stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new catastrophe in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Yoko who is seeking re-election next year suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by continuing confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrow and arches, as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation hits against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 at a distance of about 27 meters from the gate of Chelsea.
He directed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penitentiary room and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I’ve just tried to make as much time as possible for myself.” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea passed through the Belgian Star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute at a half-time of 1:0.
The Blues storm returned a pass with the heel to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpooler half.
Kovavic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard entered the penitentiary room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and ended up in the net with a left-wing shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea is facing videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m.
The number of Tsunamis deaths in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the ruins of buildings that were brought to ruin by the earthquake of strength 7.5 from Friday, which had caused up to six meters of waves, reported government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests man, 32, for murder suspects after a woman is stunned
After finding a female lay this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was started.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call on residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and the police reported that they are in the process of informing the victims' closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats over and over again, 'that's so terrible'.
At 14:00 there were two police vehicles inside the lock and another vehicle before the lock.
Within the lock were several police officers monitoring the block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to Protocol 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the latest monument to the dispute on the rewritten of history.
Their banishment would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious art products in England by its fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "terrorism" and "trying to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Palace of Westminster was the goal.
The visual storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestral Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history writing of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is more considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, than anyone who defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course through the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely true representation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname 'Yuan' was mentioned, was found dead with a severed artery flooded near a pig stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, is ready to inject pigs vaccines.
He reportedly had arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring porcupine was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilometer pig had killed the farmers.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News, the cousin to whom the last name was called "Wu".
Recordings of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime scene.
According to Yuan's family and market authorities, reports are negotiating compensation for his death.
While pigs rarely attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 405 - pound [290 kg] pig jammed a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs would not normally be aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "trigger".
“They’re just playful.
They like to grow up and are very curious, ... they're not bent on hurting someone.
You only have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
How predicted Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods of rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a hurricane of category 1, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific, which moves east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the south-west of the USA.
Rosa will cause precipitation in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimetres on Monday.
Then, in the next few days, tropical moisture will produce widespread rainfall in the south-west due to interactions with the trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation can cause dangerous floods, water-moving debris and possibly land slides in the desert.
High tropical humidity results in precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall are expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluent floods with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgently advised not to walk into the desert.
Strong rainfall may result in canyons becoming cracking streams, and thunderstorms bring local windbows as well as wind that leads to dust.
The approaching trough brings locally strong rain in parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation amounts of more than a centimetres may be possible, which can lead to low water-driving bulk and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads into the Four Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the US, as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the USA.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the US, a warm October start with widespread temperatures of 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above average temperatures in the first half of October in the East of the USA.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million viewers have seen the captivating statements of the board Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court and the wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. On Friday, the TV stations interrupted their regular program because of a turn in the last minute: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, which is intended by the FBI to carry out a one-week investigation of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had oppressed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscar award.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million spectators from the full-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesters in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with words.
He stood for minutes with lowered eyes while being shocked. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"You have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and supplemented it before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later when the Justice Committee was to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote at the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would do this only on condition that the FBI, as requested by the democratic minority, investigate the accusations against the candidates in the next week.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanaugh's confirmation without the investigation.
President Trump has led an FBI investigation of the accusations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans to leave the European Union of using the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party's party meeting in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the cover page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual introduction of duties by the United Kingdom and the EU as "full absurd".
Killing shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is reported to have been arrested and detained by Baton Rouge for killing.
The authority published video recordings of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, the police made sure the glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson's glasses found DNA.
After a survey of Simpson, the police reported that he had stood the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit has been fixed at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police's criminal-technical laboratory, Southern University Police and citizens in the area for their support in the arrest investigation.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement authority for 'their care and pursuit of justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
==References====External links==* Official website
In the last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball trainer Will Wade said that the team was "deeply shaken" by Wayde's death and "stand under shock".
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City.
Ash thrown out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and were registered in 183 emissions of gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of growls and tremors.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in districts of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since September 2017 an earthquake of strength 7.1 Central Mexicans had shaken, noted increased activity at the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after conflicts between the standby police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were held back by the standby police, threw them with eggs and also sluttered paint powder, so that dark clouds of dust arose in the normally populated streets with tourists.
In the course of the day, the police used their batons to control the fights were also hand-mixed.
For several hours, pro-independence groups "No forgetful, no forgiveness" scandaled them while facing Unionists calling "Long live Spain".
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had opted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although voting was low, since the opponents boycotted the vote to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent conflicts before the constituencies.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they await their procedures because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been startled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to challenge the reduction of democratic values and the oppression of the Spanish government is to vote," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after the British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, an armbrush may have been shot on the car.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The raised Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Menga's hits proved to be crucial to the fact that Gary Holt's team was able to compete with Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without victory and next Sunday will face the Hearts, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers are host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his victory series in the division to six games, i.e., Chief Trainer Holt has not recorded any defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the hit, since his directing put Rangers in front of the many different problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, however, slowed down in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had come down here to hit Craig Halkett’s headshot past the gate.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of themselves, as they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate was established.
The Rangers allowed an release, and Livingston prepared a chance to shoot Menga with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penitentiary.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unlit.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced him to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was repelled by Ranger's tourist Allan McGregor, and Lithgow passed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
The flanks came to Livingston's penitentiary room and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two demanded criminal offenses – one by Halkett against the replaced Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were refused.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and exceeded the expectations in this upward trend again.
Their style of play and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has awakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on Trab throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were sometimes under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once could they penetrate the host team – and this is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan with mixed reactions received in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the Heads of Government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons that they prevented a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also heard. They condemned Erdogan’s politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as hero and mocked by others as autocratic.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car a cyclist died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. in the British summertime near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics took care of the man who died at the accident site.
months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in an accident with a driver's flight on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the Saturday accident.
According to Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his next family.
Roadblocks and detours for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in a men's high-security prison in unrest.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still continuing.
Specialized "Tornado" officials have been moved to end the unrest in which eight inmates are involved and confined to a wing.
The officials were treated on site for minor injuries on the face.
One speaker from the Prison Service said: “It has been used specifically for trained prison staff to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over to the police and may spend some time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated by a prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October of last year, police officers were sent to prison to deal with severe riots involving the staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluent floods (Durre regions may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move over the desert-influenced southwest and bring with it the risk of fluent flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods of fluff on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada and to the southeast of California and Utah including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation with a single of up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-shaped southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely to be possible, with a total of up to 10 centimetres.
For those who do not have the risk of fluent flooding, the rainfall associated with pink may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, in part this rain will be useful, as drought is currently in existence in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme droughts occur in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the Hurricane path means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
Precipitation may be severe in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, precipitation amounts are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible,"weather.com reported.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north across Mexico, in the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, reach the border with Arizona and then move up to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"The main danger is expected in connection with pink or its remains very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-induced Southwest of the USA," the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these rainfalls, life - threatening floods and floods of water are expected in the desert, as well as in mountainous areas of land slides.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three boys in the teen age and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked all those who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the commonplace, the anger" of the democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the whole process of nomination, Kavanaugh had suffered "under the community, the anger" of the democrats.
Kavanaugh said before the Congress on Thursday and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually harassed decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also said at the hearing that she was accusing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general public," he said to the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the inter-elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not acting, but in reality I am acting," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were looking at their mission to "do and block resistance".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday in the Senate, said a high-level employee of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victim numbers rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were flooded as a result of a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi huge waves hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when, at the intrusion of the darkness, up to six meters of waves hit the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami had preceded an earthquake of strength 7.5.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still working on the beach and were not running away immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was swimming cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people were on the run from the tsunami climbing on trees and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Air images published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, banished and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that during the massive earthquake of Friday energy was released, the 200-fold of the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "extremely" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to his information, the bodies were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage along the coast could have been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala was completely paralysed in the words of Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross declaration, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not informing that a tsunami had met Palu, although the waves came in at the time of warning, according to official information.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man on the upper floor of a building who is desperately warning the people on the street under him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall forces on the shore and floats buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive power outage that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city's airport remains closed until October and has only been re-opened for assistance.
For Sunday a visit of President Joko Widodo was planned in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, they passed along the way through scenes of devastation.
"They said they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began the hard task of launching the disaster relief, some of them assembled that expert foreign helpers would be prevented on the trip to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened until now.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the missing ones hoped for one of the wonders that illuminating the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian Games ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Some of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, as Mandagi added.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders, he was in doubt sending WhatsApp news to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, led to only grey question marks instead of blue ticks.
"I think that means the news has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 US dollars during the space of a ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Diebe, a Brink’s employee stole $26,750 when filling a ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to pay more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag full of money for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons with information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Faster changes its name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
When the change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known beings as Kanye West).
West, 41, has the nickname Ye for some time and has used him as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change is ahead of his performance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He will act as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has cancelled 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but, according to its own statement, it has a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’”, said West this year in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West worked earlier, has already written his name with and without binding letters and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promised not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday to Tlatelco Plaza that "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's enhanced activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its expenditure on research in this field, says investors and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the US government, even though the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so much more behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of the financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Otello player. Later, he was the lead executive at Microsoft Research and President of the Google Delegation in China.
Lee honoured earlier technology competitions of the US government such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to reading, researchers in the US often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes the top academic forces away, but the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired coryphages from universities to work on AI.
According to Lees, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
"I think that in the field of AI-dominated persons should automatically be offered green cards," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read, the National Natural Science Foundation of China is funding people at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to award funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are to participate. Furthermore, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million US dollars annually in AI research.
In the meantime, US law on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is based on the Greek territory, so Greece has introduced a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign is in doubt that the voter participation reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting paper was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change of name, among which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth including in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the protection of the European Union, since it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the outcome of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will adhere to the outcome so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there had been no reports on irregularities by 13.00.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in Skopje's capital.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Stromica, Macedonia on the change in the country name that Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and to the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top of the ranks, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is less than the vote required.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with 'Yes'.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voter participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through the whole Brighton defense to achieve goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed Brighton's defense in the 2–0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penitentiary room.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penitentiary to play the ball back to Aguero, who, with his right shoe Brighton-Torchüter Mathew Ryan, was shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had reached a goal at this moment."
It was sterling, however, which gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League-Duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net shortly before he slipped into the air.
City plays in the Champions-League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies game
Since the nations are excluded from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further engagement.
However, the ever-consuming joker hopes to stand on the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if this is relevant for the rockies who have a game lead in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers for the playoffs.
The Rockies won at least one wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can throw at least because we know the atmosphere of the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but, according to reports, they tend to have Scherzer cast in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practised in the bull on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
This season, the Washington law firm has a statistics of 18-7, a ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the Kavanaugh Board chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the Republican electorate's participation in the inter-elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I'm not acting, but in reality I'm going on, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take over power again by all means, you see the community, the loathsomeness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross, to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission in 'to do and block resistance'.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "annoying and mean and disgusting and dishonest."
He named the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud bouts in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document come out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour doesn't let all opinions apply anymore.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way, because she had been energetically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for representing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "the meetings should all be included and productive".
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most of the meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'friendly, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the head of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Members with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to take a turn and take positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed – whether with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – where it doesn't matter what I say – there's a shiver in the social media calling for my election, accusing the political center and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have addressed are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face a daily flood of sexist or racist abuses, yet never give in to small ones.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuses have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we do not let all opinions apply anymore, and with every distrust and change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to take my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and I would not have any problems.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally fell apart in the school as a whole, who joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as a municipal council and as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hooligan out of my political views, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of Friday's request: given the fact that the country is going to run into a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not sending this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many threats of election or political purpose will not prevent me from acting in my opinion best interest of all of you.

Ayr versus melrose 38:17: Unbeatn Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this very entertaining game of the day in the Tennant's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams to be unbeatn at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better chances of exploitation, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far, and we're still unbeatn, so I have to be glad," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Noise for Ayr, they have used their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, because of a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released from the Warriors for the game, Melrose was able to have the numbers spoken, and Jason Baggot caught an unenhanced attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a criminal action before reaching a hit directly at half-time and then made an increased attempt on his own, so that it stood for Ayr at Pause 17:5.
Melrose began the second half, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then, there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded its lead by an attempt by Climo raised by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose made enormous pressure pay for the additional man by an unenhanced attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson reached a touchdown from the criminal street behind the moving Ayr package.
Like almost since the interruption, Climo increased after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxkick and sent off flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” star seems ready for new careers in the gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the hospitality after it turned out that he was called the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kirunn seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kizenn was interested in entering Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
'The sea belongs to us': Bolivia, included by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the Marine headquarters decorated with Tauwerk in La Paz.
On public buildings a sea blue flag blows.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovering it is a duty."
All over Bolivia, the memory of the part of Chile lost in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be taken on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the swing, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result of course with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians will follow the ruling of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim. According to this, Chile is obliged, after decades of sporadic discussions, to negotiate a sovereign access to Bolivia to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, much is also at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts think it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also make little change.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands is not entitled to adjudicate Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
In the view of Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the ruling of the IGH was already in place six months after the closing plea, suggests that the case was 'not complicated'.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has torn the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She suggested that Morales' wary rhetoric has suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their discussions, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the decision of the Court of Justice was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia 'has an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile' and an opportunity to 'end the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit', he said.
Calzadilla also argued that morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the subject of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the Heads of State of the rivals in Singapore.
At a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be standing close to the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore more than three months after the summit, his comments appear to bring the determined nuclear diplomacy back in motion.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and resistance from the USA against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North to kneel, as "spinning of the brain".
Washington is skeptical and would not agree to the explanation without Pjöngjang taking essential disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngjang is serious about the abandonment of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pjöngjang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgears that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the runway a palette of crazy, oversized head coverings for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the runway.
The most outstanding piece by Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a spring-like wide edge, which directly suppressed the heads of the models.
As further oversized accessories, watermelons, a sorcerer hat and even a pineapple were shown with jewels. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with sewn lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skin couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion viewers predict that the huge headgear could find their way into shopping streets nearby.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a width of 60 cm, all of which carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit big waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the runway: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as large as the one-suit model that kept the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bast frans and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" during the Paris fashion week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to be available next summer in the shopping streets. The designer has aroused so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens essential
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach out to his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current audit results of this year are found to be at the top of the rankings of the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved the grade A during the higher examinations.
According to the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin scored the grade A during the higher examinations, while 72 percent of the students who learned German achieved 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also received the grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are today regarded as elective subjects, as are STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers called for the problems of occupying positions were related to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
Since more and more open places require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Independent of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically give an advantage to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language education.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, in independent schools there will always be a number of languages with relevant specialised teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, regardless of the future.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James act for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the previous season.
However, how many minutes it will play is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James is likely to play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers.
"I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Time for Trumps rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election demonstrations.
This is the first of Trump's five rallys planned for the next week, including well-minded places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump’s rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 pm (East Coast).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of Kavanaugh Board nominated for the Supreme Court to accusations of sexual misconduct that were led to a tense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in the float for up to a week, while the FBI conducts investigations.
The main objective of this rally series, however, is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in November.
That is why President Trump's election team told Reuters that the next week's five rallys are to "mobilize volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is so important for his plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible while the operational election season is approaching," said a Trump campaign spokesperson who did not want to name his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the rally followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate and report media from Pittsburgh for tonight's evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support the previous Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to get him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the USA shows a willingness to fight to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
As a sport concept, the swinging pendulum is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, especially in competitions like these.
So where is the momentum of their opinion now?
“They were guided by six points, and now they’re four, so I think that’s a small momentum for us,” said Jordan Spieth, leaving the venue.
Europe is, of course, in favour and four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each have three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the turnoff to the green and progressed with good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams became louder in the course of his round as he sunk an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had returned two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream, which suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game,” said Spieth.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, without doubt writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uneven but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can't do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was not the only couple who had not beaten a Bowey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparently between them and the exhausted amount of flowing energy support that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who, when the sun falls over Le Golf National, will defeat a possible European victory.
preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief process with Sergio Garcia, the four-hero of the morning, who played together with Alex Noren.
A Bowey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Sweden into a terminal, which they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
The fours and fours pairings are so fascinating from nearby due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or not, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this four-round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe is leading the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the fours and fours from Saturday to the USA, Europe is at 10:6 a.m. and has a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the warring Tiger Woods and thus made four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the four of them in the morning and won the series with 3:1.
In the four-parts, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but could not pick up the residue.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
As the first European newcomer, Fleetwood won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of "Molliwood", won four points only as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening match.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmoniously beat the enraged Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5&4.
Woods, who had towed through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four-parties as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
But for Europe, this pleasant windy day in south-west Paris was not everything according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the slat for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory in the fours over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, playing for Spain, and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 games after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a residue of four points. However, as title holder for Furyk’s team, a final decision is enough to keep the trophy.
After they've only been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their distrust of the United States and, under these circumstances, the country would by no means give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that last year, because of 'good will', North Korea had taken essential measures. For example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear testing ground, and committed itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the USA," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will by no means be one-sided first."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in so far as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pjöngyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between a US President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim had agreed to work on the "denucleation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war that took place from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjöngjang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes demands for a relaxation of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
'The US insists on 'first denucleization' and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even against the 'declaration of the end of the war', said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain-spin of those who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had emphasized at the United Nations early this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party to the denuclearization question instead of the US, it would not have come to this standstill in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was enormously different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the US continent after "the evil President" called Trump Kim as a " rocket man" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim to the United Nations for his courage in the fight against disarmament, but said that much work had yet to be done and that the sanctions would have to remain in force until the de-nucleisation of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no time frame for it: "If it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjöngjang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be continued vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry Pjöngjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the verge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pjöngjang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjöngjang, he said that progress had been made only at hours later to be accused by North Korea that he had made 'goose-like demands'.
This month, North Korea praised a meeting with Moon, a missile base and a nuclear complex when the United States took "responsible measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the 'matching measures' sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Learn Harvard students in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year in basic studies. This is a measure against the expanding macho culture of keeping awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and in his opinion is the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I know about it only now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained to students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students had been deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university grounds, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of "moving a night shift" was still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on students made sleep shortages a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep should be the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, weight gain could be avoided, as sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. Last year he had completed one of his courses in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar programme of studies before they start their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler, the students should set themselves an alarm clock for bedtime and the awakening time and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light, which results from electronic screens and LED lighting, and can get the circadian rhythm out of the clock. This leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston versus Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's players
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's match for Steven Gerrard's disunity team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first off-road victory at St. Johnstone since the 4:1 triumph, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard to the second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team was eight points behind the hearts that were leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership by a distance.
Menga met seven minutes before mid-term, and the low-inspiration Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall sixth, Livingston rises third and is only behind Hibernian with the goal difference.
The Rangers also threaten further trouble after liner Calum Spence had to be treated because of a head wound by an apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which overtook Ayr and reached the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point from the Hearts last week, and would have to be excited about how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure on the move.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston achieved more if they had the ball.
They should have achieved a goal after only two minutes when Menga’s first delivery led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s Gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long release of Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot at the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game was more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour of clash between him and Steven Lawless, he should have had a criminal offence, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not let the Colombian’s complaints apply.
The Rangers reach only two goal shots in the first half of the year, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had hardly any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Oviedo Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits in the 34th minute may not match the course of the game, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and chose Menga for a simple degree.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Colibaly with Ryan Kent. The change showed effect almost immediately when the wing player put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to make the guests play exactly the game they were playing, while Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after another one.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the last phase, but McGregor stood up well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty for a lot of Jacobs late, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The violinist has since become the standard element of science and has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is that?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "In fact, I hear a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears its name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' de-carcinated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degenerated cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to detect degenerated cells.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of types of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect deuterated cells, disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many types of cancers common to the HER2 protein and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the USA in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-trumpod after his appearance at SNL, carrying a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was built up at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America-Great-Again-Captain, he continued with a chimp canonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a Sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywoodstar made fun of the Senate's judicial committee's accusations of sexual harassment on board Kavanaugh's statement to Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the record of West's schmpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock in social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of his head cover.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said according to the Washington Examer.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he would "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least twice the audience's bouts, and SNL members were embarrassingly touched, reports Variety. One person said the magazine: "It got dead in the studio."
West had been obliged late as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a presentation of the title "I Love it", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She twittered: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU DON'T ENTIFIED THE MASS."
The talk show moderator Karen Hunter, however, twittered that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do not want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, makes an ideology harmful to my community and gives himself a reward (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true of us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The Being formally known as Kanye West" (the officially known beings as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late legend of music, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Know As Prince" (The former Prince known as the artist).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would have the effect that boys often have the feeling of having to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also a member of the Game of Thrones, 31 years ago, admitted that the solution to the problem was 'very important' to him.
"I personally find the question very important, what has gone wrong with masculinity," he said.
"What have we taught men who are growing in relation to the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that due to the very masculine characters, television may partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculine.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For there has clearly been something wrong with the young men."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in the "Game of Thrones" prequels or sequences of the "Game of Thrones" in the next summer. He had "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November on, Harington will be on display in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing had been "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so I've been able to get my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow, with numerous Emmys.
In June 2018, the two married Leslies Family Affairs in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of the new cases by sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people thus infected with HIV has been reduced almost to zero, reported Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in the annual comparison, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission by sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT community members is expected to be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been promising, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the data of the GOP senators channelled, criticises "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, U.S. Representative, disputed on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Deputies.
The Democrat from Los Angeles took the view that the claims of 'ultra-judicial' experts and websites would be spread.
"Lying, lying and even more disgusting lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the charges of sexual offenses committed against the Supreme-Court Candidates Board Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts is Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for transmitting this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press speaker.
"This dementi is angry," said Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
You must not question the reasons of the prosecutor.
They must be calm and relaxed."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of the democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the mid-term elections to disband Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he twittered.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and they will be held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Criticism of "Johnny English – Man lives only three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film. This also seems to be true for this resurgence of the action comedian parody franchise "Johnny English" which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion who destroyed it" and revived in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now quite" stuttering again.
Will an ironic self-parody on the issue, how obviously stupid are we, become a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, for the second time, the license of the glamorous, Grimas cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinematic visitors in non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is again the knocked secret agent, who, bizarrely, considers himself to be cool and world-wide, while in reality he has contributed to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind leaving behind travelers and international secret agents, who Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television spots.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades were briefly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics shows up, but the humour seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedian elements.
The humour seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy miscarriages are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent film Gags in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise is now that the UK is in great danger.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in action, very much to the abuse of the serving agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and suppressed figure that is already in front of the complete collapse due to her political infatuation: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi Teresa May character, but the script does not produce much with which she can work
Their intelligence consultants inform you that all active spies have been detanged and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a classy institution, but there is an unofficial teaching in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commandant, a nervous woman of higher society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of their Majesty always make everything awfully wrong, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously caught up in the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of the UK.
English and Bough start their Odyssey of grotesque fun: When waiters dress up a fancy French restaurant in fire, they look after chaos as they smuggle on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to get familiar with the interior of Voltas' house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the subject is discussed in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: "Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?"
Labour argues to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, which provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party intends to report that corporate managers pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off to workers.
This would have given the employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to the sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of the workers are 'fit'.
The changeover to a four-day week was supported by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is expected that a directive review will be announced before the end of the year.
'A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort which is consistent with the Party's approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and with the general industrial policy strategy of the Party.'
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised to introduce a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party.
One spokesperson of the Labour Party said: "It is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretely stated his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of 'anonymous directors' and 'profit-makers' from public utility companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not be able to hold back their total share, as a Labour government could be responsible for alleged misbehaviors of "deductions".
He also confirmed the relevant plans to appoint employees to the board of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10 % of the equity of private companies to employees who deposit annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the news magazine "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change its opinion
The FBI investigation into the accusations against Richter Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could show something that could eventually change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, said this claim, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be ground in stone.
"My opinion is firmly on board Kavanaugh, and there should be a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has disputed this vehement," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday the Global Citizens Festival will be held in New York to combat poverty in the world, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizens Festival, which will be held this year for the 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powerty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen is still 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of putting a cool free concert in view, a sensible way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you are changing something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens reported that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions should have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid out or acquired by fundraising.
According to the Group estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementationists based in the United Kingdom, who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million in fighting malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, namely the question of why Global Citizens can combat extreme poverty,
They replied: “There will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But similar to the great civil rights and anti- apartheid movements in front of us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be performing at this year’s New York event, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington is able to resort to the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, reported US Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is to negotiate new markets in the field of energy, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc was addressed to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, who understands itself as "the voice of the electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while calling Russia "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was in the process of expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump Berlin became a "captured" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the massive resistance of Washington against the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The USA has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the USA to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," says BDI Dieter Kempf's Executive Board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “exactly examine” a presidential candidate in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
On Saturday, the Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would 'exactly examine' a presidential candidate after the inter-elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
After 6 November, Warren plans to 'exactly examine' a presidential candidate.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is pointing this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about the way Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren, in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, has not put a hand in her mouth.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation was of course necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren electorate did not believe that it should run for 2020.
According to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts reported that the Senator should not be able to do so.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent who support a potential candidate, and 48 percent who are against it.
Among the further names of prominent democrats who are eligible for a potential candidate in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin expresses himself at Donald Trump-Ralley on post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all this can be done by other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "Elefant in the Space" and said about her son and other war veterans that they would come back changed, that they would return more brutally, that they would come back and ask themselves if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. support a remedy to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support a remedy to the new US policy that refuses victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a court expert statement on Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seekers who question politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace-versus-Sessions-complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not announced.
She said that her partner "and his violent band sons" abused them, but U.S. officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that face major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asyl policy lifted a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeal decision that allowed illegal immigrants on the run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Federal Advocate General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored the decades of legislation at state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court infringes this principle", was stated in the Court's expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country has an unfavourable effect on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour force.
Federal Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges who fled domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs no longer grant asylum.
"Asyl exists for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or for fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," said Sessions in its June 11 policy announcement.
It has never been the plan to emancipate all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face worldwide every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths doubles over time in the race
The situation became increasingly worse for survivors.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed city center of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their goods and possessions and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals damaged by the 7.5 earthquake were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and a broken shoulder, stayed outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continuing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and his daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the invading walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador charges China with the tyranny with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper that announced the mutual benefits of trade between the USA and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for progaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of intervening in the US Congress elections on 6 November, an indictment that contests China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. elections corresponds to the announcement of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn advertisements to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an expatriate trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in such states as Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China to a large extent, reported that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, says Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by switching propaganda ads in its own free press in the USA.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the tradition of freedom of expression and the independent press in America by switching the country's paid advertising into the Des Moines Register," said Branstad.
"In contrast, you will only find a limited number of votes against at the Beijing newspaper skis and will not really reflect the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of the most famous newspapers in China did not accept the offer to publish its article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans beat voters before intervening with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warning observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Board Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming inter-elections, which could in particular result from women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they continue to vote.
"You can't undo such things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute advance was sufficient for an FBI investigation to correct angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the first consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the hall of the Senate "November is coming!", when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to hold on to the nomination of Kavanaugh and reported this despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, told Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the suburbs and for younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which their accusations of sexual attack against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a messy mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just the vote of the committee, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way in which the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of democrats, to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree on whom they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% stated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% stated that they considered that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% stated the same about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another applicant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an affidavit in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
"We must now become active," he said on the topic of startup.
'It's a historic moment.'
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online storage or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special feature of personal online data storage is that the user can only decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as a personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate capabilities so that solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been employed for the work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Interrupt website.
Berners-Lee informed us that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, during which their entire business models will be completely remodelled overnight.
'We do not ask for their permission.'
In a contribution to medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has played a significant role in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very confident of this new era of web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant and priest Bernard Vann won the award because of his commitment to attack Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the granddaughters, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and a violent fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed the line to the fire line and led the line forward with the 'greatest braveness' before moving ahead with a field weapon in the single passage and shutting off three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something he could never justify, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath on the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero became visible especially through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead there were Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to see an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly on view.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight specifically.
On Twitter, a fan described the switch to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
"As a result of a government regulation, this content is not considered to be free of youth, so that it was necessary to switch to a child's broadcast at 6 a.m.", said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of the Marketing and Communication Division at Bellator when he was asked about the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Board of Directors at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the timetable to take into account viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that the problem could have been solved in the replay game already," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we stay on it.
There was a lot of communication on the change. It was quite messed up and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is rather unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "understand" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up feeling that he was inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke on the subject of gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, he said that he used to view himself as inferior compared to others, since the love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said, "Until today, it is feeling to be inferior and different from others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to not let anyone down when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, and the realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference was never a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and a youth – he participated in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have a son since June who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year's gold medals were all about him.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the near death, and one of the last things he asked for was the London 2012 tickets, as he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I just knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at Olympic games – that was the insanity,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still provided goose skin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, is sitting at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bench
The American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a great effort so that the whole thing doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the event as usual, the five-fold major winner spent his day cheering others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National Golf Course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be disheartening enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put up a hot start with four points at the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much.
“He was perfectly aware of his role today, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's well-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was at two games.
I thought more, but that's how it went, and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will achieve the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games held on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway, which never entirely corresponded to the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to defeat 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk reported that his presence had already enriched the team alone.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few funs, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that the lead can be over soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points against the Americans, but only nearly reached the finish line and headed with the smallest possible advantage, winning a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The thought remains that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that only scarcely,” said Bjørn (shown in the photo) after seeing the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's going on right in the morning.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said that I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely aware of what's facing us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Rejoice at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never interrupt it.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are in the foreground and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things are running well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested as a golfer up to the limits of your skills.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will ensure that his players cut out better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big rounds on the last day of the tournament. He was on the winner's side in Brookline before standing on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wunder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to subtract the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of catching up with him in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as further Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I have opted for the boys in this order, since I think it covers everything," Bjorn says about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship once again delayed
The latest frigates of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace years of war ships from the Cold War. However, according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapid growing costs, it is only delivered at the earliest next year.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called for a military speaker.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea target missiles, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays may cause the state-of-the-art warships, which Germany is to represent as maritime power, to be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The Fregatte F125, who was persecuted by accident, came to the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
It became little known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of important "software and hardware errors" that the new ship would have made unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to performance losses and that it can prevent future upgrade measures from being implemented by the Navy.
The 7000-tonne 'Rheinland-Pfalz' was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, was also a problem.
It seems that the costs rose to €3.1 billion, compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, representative of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the Navy is "going out of the operational vessels".
Bartels said that the problem was getting bigger over time, because old ships were taken out of service but no spare ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help lead future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will investigate dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown ear and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
A sound analysis of all recordings by experts determines the frequency of bat calls and determines what species does.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures to manage habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have fallen significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-catchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nocturnal hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of dormitory places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Assistant David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
"Here in Three, we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we carry out these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, as it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: 'We still have a lot to learn about bats and with many of our species we do not know how it is about their populations.'
Ronaldo contests rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as "fake news" and said that people would like to "be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The storm of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raped in 2009 by an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He then claimed to pay her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence to the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo mentioned the reports as "fake news" only hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News", said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror because of the accusations they have referred to as 'unauthorised reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy'.
Lawyers Christian Schertz said that the player claimed compensation for "moral damage at an altitude equal to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is expected to take place in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayora reportedly went to the player's room, where, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, he reportedly raped them anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was kneeling after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was agreeable.
Mayora also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but had later been admitted to an extrajudicial agreement, because she had "anxious retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that they are now trying to lift the agreement, since it was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he changed to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘everlastingly regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “everlastingly regret it” if it lost its status as a world’s leading manufacturer of cars, says Secretary of State Greg Clark.
He also said that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it was going to interrupt production in the plant in Burnaston near Derby, if Great Britain were to leave the EU.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the influence of delays at the border in a no-deal-brexit could lead to job loss.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyotas product lines Auris and Avensis are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that at the end of March, we will experience production stops in our plant at an uncontrolled Brexit," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotas Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, also had concerns about a tough EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close his mini-works in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyotas manufacturing plant is operated on an “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers both from the United Kingdom and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be any interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to keep a stock of stocks at the Derbyshire plant for longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa Mays Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls."
“We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I said, enables us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity,” he said in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest officer of the Unite Union, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they have gone.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be relocated according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be 'moved for another week' while the dispute over the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has been responsible for the work of the Special Interlocutor Robert Mueller, who examines Russia's election interference, links between Trump's consultants and Russia, and a possible judicial disability by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thus endanger the independence of Mueller was the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and the President's withdrawal with the help of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the UN General Assembly in New York was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, in view of all the things that are going ahead with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held the White House Press Conference since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her about the reason.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie in an aversion to the TV reporters' "effect-hashing" but admitted: "I would not dispute that they operate haphazards."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President made more rounds of questions and answers than any President before him," she said, without giving any precise evidence: 'We have looked at these figures.'
There will still be press conferences, Sanders says, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it will be far better than to talk to me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done so many times in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he made an out of the row and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees of the Scottish NHS because of the Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health is addressing people from the EU foreign countries who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express the desire that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter from the EU less than six months before the UK left.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of how disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate each and every employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of health services and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very pleased if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was subjected to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodore.
Rod Reed, the chief trainer of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was laid on a carrying and transported for further investigations.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the type or extent of the injury have yet been known" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a so-called red-shirt, plays with Tennessee State in his first season after he changed over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, thus increasing his total number to 18 Tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
In the future, investors from abroad will have to apply a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party of the homeless
This step will reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the additional income of homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to limit Jeremy Corbyn's success with young voters who promise to provide more affordable living space and to attract top earners.
The increase in stamp tax is applied to individuals and companies which do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional revenue is intended to be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago to second dwellings and residential property left to rent, the surcharge could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom, thus raising prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to take a foothold in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'spirit cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has declared himself to reduce the stamp tax in order to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of holding up real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable dwellings in order to end Britain's 'dwelling room'.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking set of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price link to a ban on rooms without a good reason.
He also wants to give city councillors more powers to build new apartments.
May stated: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life from generation to generation should improve.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies based abroad, it is as easy to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too far for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness continues to be too big a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘greatest goal’ to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of finding a new life for the association from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in the League One and lacks the three points to the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that was it," Ross told the show Sportssound from BBC Scotland.
“But as a child I have often seen Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in the association management."
Ross predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not afraid to enter the footsteps of such established names in such a club after he had previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can lead the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this association, he no doubt belongs to the Premier League," he explained.
"It's no easy task to get him there, but I'd only guess my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can show a first three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Head of Dumbarton and a 15-month work as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation into the third league and helped St. Mirren to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real way of detachment," he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny, as I didn't feel bad, could live well on it, and experienced some very pleasant high-phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin all my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday, so a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenue of Great Britain's creeping pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Public and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, the revenue from restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Sustainable sunshine and England’s longer than expected continuing participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a model similar to the previous June, in which pub’s sales increased by 2.8 percent. Restaurant, however, was even more difficult.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted revenue development that increased higher than it did at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the leisure and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales loss of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures will provide the urgently needed breathing break in August."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the fall in brand rolls.
The industry sales monitor Case Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized branch benchmark.
One of five children owns secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools found an increase on so-called "fake insta" sites
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students reported having a 'main account' to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "fake insta" accounts, a response to the Photo Sharing website of Instagram.
The news fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students reported having a clean 'main account' that they can show their parents, but also private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager asking others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of the independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'vote of athletes' in the Scottish sport council
Eiligh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member at his annual general meeting in the Council of the Scottish athletics-Dachverband Scottish Athletes.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for the sports staff to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics, called four Olympic gold medals his own and now often appears as BBC expert, could not run after a transient circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can say whether or how far I will heal.
It was hard work, but I have completely recovered, have learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
Advertising for milk pumps that compare mothers with cows ensures excitement in the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the net with an advertising clip, in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
In order to introduce the 'world's first low-noise portable milk pump' on the market, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie released a music video which is not entirely serious to emphasize the freedom given to breast-feeding mothers by the pump.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see at me a tail" or "if you haven't noticed it, these are not udders but my breasts."
In the chorus it continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, advertising, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has triggered a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from the audiences, many of which say that the 'fears' of the dairy industry are impoverished.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Just as we do, they have to become pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days of birth," it said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “To understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: 'Such a non-reality advertising'.
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urcoman".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought myself one if I were still breast-feeding.
When pumping off, I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertising addressed to mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that all have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women using milk pumps indicate how they feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, to keep their babies or even to go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the associated challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-time mother appeared on the Catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly brought to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively similar, among other things, as increased rhetoric and Trump government measures have made it more difficult to accommodate children in caretakers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become a target for disfellowshipping themselves when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supervisors and other adult members of their household would have to print their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the customs authorities Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before Congress that the authority arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous entries in the criminal register.
“Most 80 percent of the people who are either self-supervisors or members of a caretaker’s household are illegally resident in the country and a large proportion of them are foreigners.
That's why we will continue to track these people," said Albumce.
In order to be able to handle the cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules which, according to the staff of the accommodations, require some children to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after the arrest, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video circuit and not personally to intervene in front of a immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of negative decisions, the person is quickly postponed.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff and reports that have been known from the system in the last month, that they are scared and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are enhanced in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that it could strengthen trauma, which many of the children already suffer, if they were brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘occupiers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of the fight against terrorism and were "treated accordingly".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions more people were expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus 'will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned', both by terrorist groups and 'any illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and consulting Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-bubbled country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" which prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable return home," he said.
'They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter.'
The United States and the European Union warned that no development aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the UN declared that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold Idlib represents the possibility for the pre-lude of political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which will be 'extended' with Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the 'recast of the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, a withdrawal of office or a scandal has ended his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no evidence that the audiences are tired.
Since 2014, the deployment rates at the best transmission time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million spectators at the best time of the broadcast, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the deployment quotas with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, show runner of the TV-station ABC drama series "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd pick Trump.
She asked him about the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh’,” Scovel told me.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything to be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it is going to be an informed citizen if you are aware that you have already watched six hours of an expert round, using sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to Washington Post, a "wear rich in self-esteem") or discussing the effects of Stormy Daniel's revolutionary description of Trump's, umm, anatomy.
I'll never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again for my part.
"A part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show he introduces every evening," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily practices (breaking a fight with the football league NFL from the fence, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a episode, otherwise you won't come along.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees before his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he hid inside and looked at MSNBC while he was recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn't get rid of the screen, not if Judge Board Kavanaugh was standing in front of the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs at the time, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donations flooded the narrowest races for seats in the Congress during the intervening elections
It is hardly surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly withdrawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which led to two officials in the race around the same seat.
The recently signed suburban district in Pittsburg has led to the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb takes action against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-drawed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were thrown against the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of election finance between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th district of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump gained advantage there with 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats easy guidance.
The US examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials have decided to deduct the heads of all U.S. representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan any longer", says Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador were thought about sanctions that in 2017 estimated $140 million in American aid, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting in the previous year and was a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the USA.
However, in mid-September, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference scheduled for mid-October, in order to provide a sign of the importance that the government of the Assembly attaches to.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new bold announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who, under the condition of anonymity, agreed to comment on the internal meetings.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next big surprise could be the report by the Special Interlocutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible judicial disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is now alleged to also investigate whether Trump's election team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the Congress majority change, Trump faced an organ that forces him to account, precisely at the time when he is passing by, to re-enter the voters; and possibly before a jury of jury jury.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that Donald Trump’s case, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovakian people in Munich.
We have failed and missed a way of avoiding the years of barbarians that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the incessant march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump releases Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, i.e. the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested to record the president secretly and speculate on it, above unfit for the office.
Rosenstein is dementing the representation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statements in office?
And above all, will we vote in the intervening elections for a Congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these trials, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I think we will not fail because of what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this heritage?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain will put it in a good position at the beginning of the month for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League.
Because of a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 equals against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for Greater Ones.
"This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we drove home with one point.
Perhaps we could still have won in the end, but overall a disagreement was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and then we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we'll get three points, but that's going to be a tough game, because they've achieved a good result in the last game. But I'm sure we can go through with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of feeling of well-being.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of age benefits leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the study of Nationwide reported talking to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take the necessary steps to have the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor aboard: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Keep an eye on legal disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you can instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the healthcare professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a proxy for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drug intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with airgun
A man was shot several times with an airgun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the '40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shots that occurred at around 02:30 British times as 'voluntary act'.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Because of the failing communication systems, auxiliary workers were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a district in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, an estimated 299,200 people lived in the government district, an administrative unit below the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income of the economy Central Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickelabbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunami several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed almost 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with the strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands before Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pdie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died by a crashing building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists and claimed more than 500 deaths, especially on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor Alaska and former candidate for the Vice-President's Office, was arrested for allegations of injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of the report of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, he took a friend's phone when he wanted to inform the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in detention in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of 500 dollars has been raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when he was asked for his plea, he replied with "not guilty, quite sure" the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three Class A illegalities, which can be punished with up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with an illegality of Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been fined.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under negotiation before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under anaesthetic influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend told him to hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she returned her son's behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder in Iraq as a result of his time.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesis, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks videos circulate from the time when the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Bundesanwaltschaft demands rare death penalty for suspects in New York's terrorist attack
The Federal Prosecutor's Office in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, who cost eight people's lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the Home Depot chain for a terrorist attack, during which he raced on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight of them "targeted" and "consciously" caused serious bodily injuries, as stated in the Declaration of Understanding for the death penalty filed in New York's southern district.
Both charges could be punished with death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Enforcement Court of Saipov filed an indictment in 22 points, including eight charges of the murder in the context of the organized crime normally used by state lawyers in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "basic planning and purpose", according to the prosecutors who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as "abominable, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hern Ferruchi, Hernn Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damnucco damage, pain and loss," says the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was carried out in New York during a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been pronounced guilty of conspiracy for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of a lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He indicated before investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also demanded that the flag of ISIS be hanged in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenses representing Saipov, said that they were "of course disappointed" because of the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only prolong the trauma that all those involved will suffer instead of a confession of guilt in exchange for a life-long imprisonment without the possibility of being released," says Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charges not to demand the death penalty.
A Member of the Conservative Party calls on NIGEL FARAGE to delegate the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise "the power of the people" today during a protest action in the context of the conference of the Tories.
The former head of the Ukip party stated that politicians must "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics, while a representative of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage conduct the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative rear banker Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "ready out" if Farage was Brexit Minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciling its deeply disputed parts was intensified by the fact that members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems in keeping track of her Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by the Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Ally insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Euroskeptics and the oppositional Labour Party to decide between her package and the "chaos".
At the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull, Bone explained that “Chequers belong to the trash.”
He suggested that Farage should have been named a peer and transferred to him the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for this, we would already be outside," he explained.
Wellingborough’s Member added: ‘I’m going to stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the trash.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We did not fight in World Wars to be subjective.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit proponent of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and explained to reporters: 'I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a keen message to May, she continued: ‘Premier ministers keep their jobs when you keep their promises.’
Farage explained in a speech that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’, they should be in the process of cheating the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” says Farage.
“They are trying to cheat Brexit and that is why we are here today to say to them, ‘That you do not get away with it’.
In front of a enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to feel the pressure on our political class, which is just ahead of betraying Brexit.
“We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which helped us to win in the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not an independent, self-regulating, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists swirled banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are present for the smooth border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” said Adonis.
"This is a farce.
There is just no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘exactly examine’ the presidential candidate.
The US senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the elections in November, she would "check the presidential candidate closely".
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts-Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voiced critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the re-election for the Senate against the Republican MP in the Massachusetts Geoff Diehl Parliament, who in 2016 was vice-president of Trump's election team in Massachusetts.
It was the focus of speculation that could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women "to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge's police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday's LSU basketball player Wayde Sims in case of fatal shots.
At a press conference, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested at 11 a.m. in the morning.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," according to the sports media portal 247sports of police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday told the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been in the scene and possession of a weapon and to have shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season and was able to have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great Prize from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Stallorder of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas managed a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton get into traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later in the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-on-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside to endure with the risk of two movements in order to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round seven.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the 44th round in the box and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri did an excellent performance all weekend and how a real gentleman acted when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done excellent work to win a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter not be passed on to the press to the candidate for the Supreme Court Board Board of Kavanaugh.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement to the Senate Justice Committee was not directly addressed, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “common, evil and dishonest”.
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has taken place in the Senate in the last few days is seeing the anger when you see people who are angry and angry and evil and dishonest," the President said.
“When you look at the Leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was given the letter with Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published in early September. However, Feinstein disputes that the leak comes from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I agreed to her request for secrecy."
Her dementi did not seem to arrive well at the president who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign event: “I tell you one thing, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate, accused by three women of sexual assaults, the democrats claimed to use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
One sees the community, the evil, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to gain power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5-3 win in the replay in Dundee on Saturday again.
The Giants went on tour early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team the compensation before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard was like Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won with two goals.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the men of Adam Keepe who beat Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth round of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening gate was completed in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford provided the template when Beauvillier expanded the tour.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan put the home team back into play after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to make up for it after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' leadership before the half-time break, when he reached his second gate of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard re-established with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half-time. Nielsen then secured the victory to his team with a fifth goal after almost half the second half-time.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at the Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controllers died after he was sure that hundreds of people in an airplane would escape the earthquake
A flight lot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to safely launch an airplane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gnjakan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly changing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
It remained to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely stop.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The country’s Civil Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase, as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it could get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in an address to the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to accomplish all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you ready?" said CNN.
This year, Indonesia has already been shaken by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aviation crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing one after plane crash in Laguna
The airline carrying out the flight that fell into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely evacuated from the dwindling aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they can't say anything about a passenger's stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline indicated working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water during the attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in a stable state.
The cause and precise course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane flew out of the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to improve a dock with an inflatable boat were rushing to help people get to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people have been killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment concluded its evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spent hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how on the basis of phone calls he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, says the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during the period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said that he had been in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated having known Chambers at their time of death for two weeks.
Mobile phone records, however, indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis was loosed some time after Chamber's death from his cell phone news, calls, and contact information.
"He has removed them from his life," says Hale.
The defense is expected to start their pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then go before the jury on that day.

Another black one?!
New York nanny sued couple for a release after "racial" SMS
A New York child girl sues a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving a misguided message from the mother in which she complained that she was "still a black one".
The couple disputed to be racist and compared the dispute with an 'expressed'.
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEE, NOT A SWARZE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released the "painfully touched" plasco and claimed that the unlocked African mother-in-law had done bad work and expected a Philippines woman instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the redundancie and asserts a claim for compensation for the 350 dollars a day, which she should have been booked for over six months for which the job she had originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, that's not what you're doing," she said to the newspaper on Friday, "I know that's discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism allegations, and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had offended her, could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
"But would you trust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with an "expressed" and declared that his wife expected a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want such a person to be interested?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
As the dispute continues, the couple were quickly sentenced to the public and denounced on the social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a speaking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is hard to put himself in someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, had been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddingtons, which she describes as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't boast," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who did something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that doctors gave her little chance," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received the call from Nad, where he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications you gave the doctors to keep her heart on the pump slowly sounded and left her body.
She had died just before, and this was the moment everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang up cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their families through a suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting stations.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was facing a promising career as a cook and had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, after the suicide, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I am always afraid that this could have an effect."
Davis has designed the cards “to show the people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was at the lowest point. When the children took out their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to go through it: “It rips a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Board Kavanaugh's future in the float while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like this that he asked for, i.e. a time and to the extent limited investigation, then perhaps we could get a little agreement," said Flake on Saturday. He fears that the committee would "break up" in the party political standstill.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Her reluctance can only be traced back to the timing.
The intermediate elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush seized the phone listener to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to decide on equality of vote and to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers ‘sinkt’ under Kim
The number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who refers to data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that last year 1127 overflowers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher human smugglers prices as main factors.
Pjöngjang did not express himself publicly.
The vast majority of the overruns from the north are finally offered to South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the overflowers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjöngjang to discuss the de-nucleisation negotiations that were held.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work towards a denucleized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for lack of progress.
"Without being able to rely on the USA, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the Office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi House of Representatives called Richter Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was characteristicly inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented in an emotional way allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and stood in tears shortly before when he spoke of his family and high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him a "great and coordinated reputation" organized by Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because she showed that he was prejudiced against democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way in which he came about the Clintons and the Democrats, he has declared himself unsuitable," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judicial post," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that she was concerned as a democrat about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the principle of abortion Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person to go to this court and expect us to say, "Oh, that's not wonderful," says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts to cry, she says to the person she said, “They may think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she'll just keep talking.
I found this awesome."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried because of an unspeakable anger and was put on a collar by an older woman, an undercooled manager, who was always a little scared, and drawn to a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re so mad.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when hard was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business at an extramarital affair and then withdrawn his candidate, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"That wasn't a well thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone mentioned the situation: ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’.
Since the election campaign was already advanced, it was at the back of the fund-raising and it swore not to run for a bid if it was not to get $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, the men donated $1,000, only supported their campaign with 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
At the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so grateful for her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the procurement and direct addressing of voters so difficult instead of the delegates, as well as the rage about sexism, so overwhelming that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I was suffering a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“One could have believed that the pocket cloth manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She weeps?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the USA and China
The opening ointments of the trade war between the USA and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he charged with fines for major Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new fines on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the USA.
Beijing struck back every time in the same way and recently raised fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to respond to any US measure and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon stumble.
However, a public intrusion towards the US would be far too derisive for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the long-term effects of the trade war by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually far more dangerous than many observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the think factory Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the war that has lasted for seven years.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any conditions of assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won any Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the USA.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, lowered his discount on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his laps and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Rider Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won the single encounters against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I have persecuted on television since my childhood," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had problems finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a good job.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be her captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
