Members of the National Assembly of Wales ensure that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament) has been launched among the members of the National Assembly of Wales.
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘is rhyming on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is 'unsatisfied' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is 'open' for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently preparing legislation to implement the name change, said: 'Of course, it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales itself who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were granted the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be re-baptised to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the option MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching consensus, and in a few weeks' time she will have to submit a bill on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote for their new title if they debate legislation.
Residents of Macedonia shall vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country.
On Sunday, voters vote to change the name of their country to ‘the Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a serious dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the change of name, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of The referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem are hard
'The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church at every corner in the past,' said Mr Adams.
Today there is neither a café, nor a church to be seen."
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
'People now have social contact in another way,' he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly visit.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of selling the assets of the churches will last less long if the leaders expect, 'and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.'
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining resorts of the neighborhood.
'The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,' he says, 'which will result in these churches to be closed even more quickly, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.'
Both churches were once built by a white church church before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carcass.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beard 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the beard in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carcass in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carcass of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by church laymen, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would "want to pass on the costs" to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in the hire of the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark wounded 13-year-old who dived into lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who appeared to lobsters in California. The boy suffered injuries, so it reads.
The attack took place just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he had docked for about half an hour with friends when he heard the boy crying out for help. Together with some others, he went to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘ that the boy was crying out, ‘ I’m bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His keybone was completely open,' saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
'I cried out that everyone should get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be in danger of death.
It is not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard Captain Larry Giles told in a press conference that a shark had been ridiculed in the neighborhood a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments in which specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale houses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they are successful, they are introduced next year into even more shops.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill the rack where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with tableau per brand, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique make-up back on the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop concessions will be tested in two Sainsbury's shops. The first one was opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and more often buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like department stores, now the supermarket chain is taking it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have yielded more efficiency.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his department Beauty and Pharmacy a makeover, it became a flop.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a cooperation with Boots, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of the revenue from the pharmacy department in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments were sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain three years ago for an amount of £125 million.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: 'We have completely changed the design of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive surroundings and the convenient locations we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'frozen' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'voicing' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
Jones's and Willoughby's company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning's 37-year-old presentation announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones from Dragons Den is on Holly Willoughby, because at the last moment she withdrew from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was 'wrote' when Willoughby announced on Tuesday at a difficult meeting in the headquarters of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she did not leave enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories because of her new contracts (with a value of a value of a million pounds).
The company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation homes abroad.
One source said, 'Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was invading when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the main settlement in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the present attrice, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and as the launch could now increase further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who has three children, have been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become Merkambasseur of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: 'We have no comment on his business matters.'
Hard language, and then it was love between us.
He laughed at the criticism he would get in the media for a remark he made that some people would find 'uneasy to a president', and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting, and Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been closed.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'correspondent reaction' by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results, that the missile tests have ended, that hostages have been liberated and that the physical surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
'It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this busy arena, about 200 people would stand here,' said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for setting up international aid.
'Unfortunately, in many cases it is clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether foreign aid providers can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would get permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis present in Palu, even if a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
It can also be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another under ideal conditions.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship moored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the place of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's wireless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Yoko's government is facing a lack of funding, which he hopes will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fight on the streets, with machetes, arrows, and arches, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was standing at a distance of about 30 meters from the target of Chelsea, at the time that his team was behind with 1-0.
He tapped to the left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the far pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, toward the top right corner of the net.
He unearthed the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and risking an attempt. I didn't really think about it, I was just kicking at the ball."
Chelsea stood at peace with 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he made his way through the civil society to Liverpool's play half.
Kovavic quickly did one-two on the civil society.
After that, he gave a nice stabpass, so that Hazard could reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker from Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays at 15 o'clock in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will be in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami death rate in Indonesia is up to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, said the Agency for Relief in National Disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, with waves also emerging from 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrests 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman has been beaten to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 at Grayson Mews in John Street, the body showing stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the locals to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has only just started, but I want to contact anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends came to think that they knew the woman on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will be hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She's just going to repeat, "What a bad thing!"
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the deposit and a third was just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents watched the apartment building.
Whoever has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111, indicating log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the rewriting history reel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious objects of art carried out by his fanatical puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as 'foolish' and 'an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on removing statues would lead to the fishing of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that existed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still has to be recognized.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the last name 'Yuan' is known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His arteries were pierced and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the inoculation of pigs at a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have traveled with his cousin from Yunnan Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be a door to a neighboring pigfold.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on its mouth was found in the pig’s cage.
A forensic investigation showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, according to the report.
'The legs of my cousin were bleeding and maimed', said the nephew with the last name 'Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in to prevent others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are said to negotiate a compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injury to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer at CBC News testified that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can cause aggression.
‘They’re just playful.
It's like kids, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens now that she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Hurricane of Category 1 at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, which moves east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trick will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west in the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and possible land shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will result in precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
There are 5 to 10 cm of rain expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions, as the tropical rain may fall very widespread.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot when tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can overturn ravines into desert rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Distributed tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will be spread more Monday by the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can vary greatly, because the Arctic is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the US, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures ranging around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, Tuesday can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance is high to mid-October at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched on one of the six television networks on Thursday at Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that was reportedly taking place in the eighties.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh beat her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a determined testimony that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have looked on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
For comparison: this is about as for a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the hearing day: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras registered that protesters shouted at him on Friday morning when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stopped standing for a few minutes with his eyes beaten down while he was being insulted, live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
‘Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone said, 'You have power, while so many women are powerless.'
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels sent out everything live when the court commission had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated by the next week, something the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was among other things convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s charges was ‘absurd’.
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a television station of CBS.
The police interviewed Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The coroner of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his 'tending and striving for justice.'
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team's broken and 'in shock' was killed by Waydes.
"This is an event that you always hope will never happen," Wade says.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
The axis sprayed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Rampen Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded in a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several rumours and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ashes appeared on authors in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geodysics have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, which was the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 hit the Richter central Mexico scale.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police flashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the birthday of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded in the riot police, while thousands of participation in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by the riot police cooled the agents with eggs and powder paints, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers took their bat up to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: 'Do not forget, do not forgive', while their opponents called 'Long live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region of independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who were against separation boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the polls in the region, resulting in violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who, together with his wife, attended the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
‘Last year we went through one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was nipt, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, because many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity, awaiting a trial of their role in organising the referendum and in proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he is taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
'A candidate for the European elections is the best way to sue the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government,' he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was rammed with a car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repeatedly framed in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at around 7.30 p.m. local time on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemings said that the gates and the building themselves had suffered damage.
It is possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's target
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them victory
He was promoted to the Ibrox club in 18 games since he was the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to be at the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to record Sunday against leader Hearts, who stands for eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna Thursday in the Europa League.
The team won six consecutive matches in his department, and trainer Holt has not suffered any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team had long been able to achieve a lead for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused a lot of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who caught the headball of Craig Halkett, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited his chances quietly and self-confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the criminal district.
At that time, the Rangers had been holding the ball for quite some time, but the defense of the home team was inviolable and goalman Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a target point.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Ranger's targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after his colleagues from Livingston.
Ongoing progress was made to the criminal court of Livingston, but they were rejected every time. Twice a punitive kick was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Femenal' by Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played invariably excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly been changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has suspended the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall made the tops of their toes run throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not know how to break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they managed only once to change the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together on Saturday (29 September) in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left Cologne for the opening of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they allowed the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Biker dies after colliding with car
In London a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an accident with flight crime on Childers Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were busy identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Sixcipiers Injured in Order Disorder
Six prisoners have been wounded in an orderly disruption in a men's heavily guarded prison, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9.30 local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still going on.
Specialized 'Tornado'cipiers are used to resolve situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The copiers were treated there for slight facial injuries.
A prisoner spokesman said: ‘There has been special training in prison staff for an up-to-date incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, the riot police was sent to prison for a serious order interference that attacked staff with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on drought areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is moving across the south-west of the desert area, which poses risks to flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang right above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain already on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be favourable, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, just over 40% of Arizona passes through at least extreme drought, the second highest category,' reportedweather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens them.
That is why it is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rain in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reportedweather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border with Arizona on Tuesday in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona on Tuesday evening and in the south of Utah.
'The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area' said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris in the deserts and land-spatch in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teen was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton at about 4 o'clock local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has suffered from the meanness, anger' of the Democratic Party
'A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh constantly 'has suffered under the meanness, anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and strongly and emotionally denied the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing about her accusation.
The President said on Saturday that the 'American people ' saw the beautiful and incredible character, the quality and courage' of Kavanaugh that day.
'A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognises one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,' he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘Over five weeks, one of the most important elections is held in our lives.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part," he said.
"That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder us."
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top-level employee of the GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds of dead by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
In a great earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of them being wiped away when huge waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of as much as six meters high hit ashore at the moment it began to shimmer. Many people fell and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
'When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,' said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for assistance to natural disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he touched everything on the land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people knocked into a tree to escape and survive the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the natural disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city continued to tremble by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has still enlarged the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala 'lits completely flat, we have no information at all', said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had struck Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building screams in panic at people on the street below to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water pours on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged away.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power disruption that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is only re-opened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll increases above 800.
It's very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of deck, but passing by scenes of devastation, said Doseba.
'They told me they saw many houses destroyed,' he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers were unable to travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be authorised if the site of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It’s still a disaster at province level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing ones kept hoping that they would find their loved ones life, as in the miracles that people like to hear from terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers liberated a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
'As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional load,' he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one gray fink appeared instead of two blue finks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 dollars during the supply of ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man ran behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flees, says the press release, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Those who have information about the identity of the perpetrators are asked to contact the Newport police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Faster turns his name into Ye
Rapper Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the creator of the show.
You're not just an abbreviation of his current name, but West told us earlier that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but announced his preference this year for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already worked with and without the coupler sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza that he would ‘never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people. During that period, left-wing student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States needs to double the amount they spend researching A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements of A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number 1 in A.I. innovation by 2030.
'Dualising the budget for A.I. research would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.', said Lee.
A doubling of the financing can lead to a doubling of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book 'Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked in Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Otello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google Department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next contest would take place because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to obtain government subsidies, said Lee.
'China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do that,' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years recruited the best forces of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that US efforts in A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
'Whoever is a PhD in A.I. should be offered a green card automatically,' he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its next generation development plan for artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Foundation provides financial support to staff of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations provide funds to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced to the White House the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than 100 million dollars in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has been in its grip for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change in their country's names
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would lead to a dispute with Greece that has been drawing on for decades and would no longer impede Greece's Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country is entitled to Greek territory, and Greece has therefore put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the vote is as follows: 'Are you in favour of NATO's membership and the EU's acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
‘Professors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of such bodies as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that originated when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
‘I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Electoral Committee said that at 1 p.m. there had been no reports of irregularities.
However, the rise was only 16% at the time, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voters in Skopje’s capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
For the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycott the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a small back gate, said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will provide much needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
From another poll conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent would vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, then the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and score
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the 2-0 game.
It seemed like a whistle of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak first played the ball on civil society.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton's criminal court.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
'Aguero has trouble with his feet,' said coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling that gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful stitch pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player typed the ball in just before he was too far.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 hrs. against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League. The competition takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Yet the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They currently have one competition at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have empowered at least one game card for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything possible to ensure their first section title.
‘Although there’s nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’d come across this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play with that?'
The Nationals still have to announce who will be going on Sunday, but are said to be inclined to draw up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the pitch field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 trapouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘All we have achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I do not take part, but actually I do participate. That's why I come up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take the power back into their hands, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they must push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "offer resistance and hinder us."
'And we've seen that for the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'boss and mean and false and lying'.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud noise from the public.
‘Do you remember what she replied?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: 'We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Member.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a more "kinder, softer" politics, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a divergent opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable to the party management or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a political view similar to mine, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are scandals on social media calling for my candidacy as a parliamentarian for the next elections, which exposes the politics of the centre and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is that there seems to be a normal view of some abusers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every ‘motion of mistrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty.
For the past two years, I have often received the advice to keep myself down, not just to express my opinion loud and then I would not ‘get into trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago as a schoolchild, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always called for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a municipal council member and in my role as Minister.
I've never kept my politics hidden, not at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my contentions with the current leadership.
To those who have advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country drags on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a parliamentarian for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatn Ayr on his way to the top
Two late try's may have shredded the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr is quite triumphant in this delicious competition of the day in the Tennant's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the classification, the only unbeatable team of the ten.
Eventually, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team victory, and coach Peter Murchie was pleased.
'We've had a hard time in our games so far, and we're still unbeatn, so I'm a happy man,' he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: 'All credit to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we have.'
Grant Anderson tried in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advantage for Ayr, but by a yellow card by Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors competition) Melrose was able to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break down a try.
With a penalty, Climo provided an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The game was held for a long time for a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was led off on a brancard, and once the match was re-started, Ayr could continue with a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed by Bruce Colvine's try at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he hit Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the moving Ayr mouth for a touch-down on the penalty-line out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new careers in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran from Still Game is in the catering room. Apparently, he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirunn is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun let Ki run in search of a way to participate in the ‘flowering restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': it includes Bolivia hoping that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Zeelui patrolling in a crafted marine office in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag is waving.
On all the marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to give to Chile after a bloody 19th-century commodity conflict is still alive, just like the desire to re-route the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in the last decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be discussed on 1 October after five years.
'Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects', said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will consider the ruling of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will argue in favour of Bolivia that, after decades of spicy discussions, Chile is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial struggle for reelection next year, much is at stake with the statement of Monday.
'We are very close to the return to the Pacific,' he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the final appeal indicates that the case was 'non-complicate', says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome from Bolivia have certainly not been improved, on the contrary, in the last four years the situation may have become even worse.
'The matter of access to the sea has been taken by the current Bolivian government,' Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has undermined all the good will that Chile might have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to talk here.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denied that the decision of the court was taken unusually quickly.
Monday, Bolivia 'will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile' and a chance to 'end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
'Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,' he added.
'The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.'
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove his nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo was about to re-start the trapped nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is an 'utopia' that the permanent sanctions and the American objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is scepticism and it is doubted that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would refrain from an arsenal that probably sees the country as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge main covers, soon for sale in your area
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, don't look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were unthinkable this summer from Instagram and these designers have sent their blinding creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung across the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gemstones, a sorcerer hat and even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were closed. They seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Stijlwatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats are perhaps inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathing suit that the bag wore.
The red orange raffia bag, decomposed with raffia franjes and finished with a white leather stallion, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags lying in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for continuing and higher education, the career they choose and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages scored a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS shows that 72 percent of the students scored high ('A') in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students received German, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM topics (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the British Employment and Skills Commission showed that some of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed 17% to a lack of linguistic knowledge, according to employers.
Language skills thus become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more job vacancies require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communication directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage to competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language above 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose for themselves which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look ahead to 2020, such as the Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specialised in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut on Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
There's still to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
'There will be more than one, and less than 48,' said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six races before the season.
'At this stage of my career, I don't need any matches before the season to prepare myself,' he said.
Period of Trump election rallys in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It's the first of five planned Trump rallys in the coming week, including stops in places that he's affectiond, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate whom he prefers to hold in the Supreme Court has been pending, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia begin tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 hrs.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearings for candidate Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra-loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the elections in November to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign management said that the next week's five rallys are intended to 'stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives', says Reuters.
'Conference control is so important to his programme that the President is traveling to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season is beginning,' said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally of tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run-up to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of opportunities is a fully invented sport concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
'They first had a six-point gap, and now that's only four more, so we find the luck to be on our side right now', said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of standing ahead of four points, while twelve are still in play.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearable opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he realized a crucial put that made four a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His well with which she won the contest at 15, was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can conclude that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
'You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game' said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but delicious European duo has four in four and nothing can do wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that didn't play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back Nine on Friday morning, she avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who have to be defeated Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
It's preferable both at different holes at the same time.
It is, however, premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front surface led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede that they no longer got over.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way in which a strategy can change in an eye.
The European team has played its best so far and has a good lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they are in front of the United States with 10-6.
The invading duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had it hard, making them now four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up with its backwardness.
Jim Furik's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles competitions of Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while Molinari and Molinari, who got the nickname 'Molliwood', are still the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup after a sensational weekend that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After they had made Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet it did not run off from a lean roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won in the four-balls after a difficult 2&1 game with the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first four holes.
It happened only twice earlier in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team could catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the Furyk team has enough to play the game, since they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to have taken too high.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continuing sanctions lead to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that over the past year North Korea had taken 'important goodwill measures', such as the halting of nuclear and missile testing, decommissioning the location for nuclear testing and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see a corresponding response from the US," he said.
'Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm ourselves.'
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phased' approach to de-uclarization, which would reward North Korea as the further steps took, it became apparent that he did not a prioritize unilateral de-uclarization, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the 'deuclarisation of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is reaching a formal end to the Korea war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'decentralization first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war', said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our distrust.'
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the American leader did raise earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: 'If the other party were in this issue of de-uclarization of South Korea and not the US, the de-uclarization of the Korean peninsula would not have been such an impasse.'
Yet, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles should be directed on the American mainland so that 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim to the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that a great deal still has to be done and that sanctions must continue to decentralise North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this: 'Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.'
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be carried on firmly and firmly until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified de-uclarization.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally implemented sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea confessed to him of setting 'goose-like demands'.
North Korea promised this month, during a meeting with Moon, to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take 'agreeable action'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'appropriate measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on the importance of sufficient peace
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to worry about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course as far as he knows this is unique in the USA.
He got the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleeplessness on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me saying, 'Why do I get to hear this right now, in my last year?'
She said no one ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is influenced by sleep shortage, and the importance of a routine when sleeping.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
With the help of a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
‘We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the effects of the choice of cigarettes on their health, added Czeisler.
The culture of studying fidelity on a nightly basis still exists, he says, and because of modern technology and increasing pressure on students sleep shortage is an ever-increasing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, as sleep shortage ensures that the brain gives them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, because last year he attended a course with the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course became available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm to stand up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics screens and led lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which may cause you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to destroy Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their race again disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first win in a race since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team won the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, which are further out at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitor team's supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They stopped Ayr and went to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same 11th for Livingston, who managed to cut off the Hearts last week. He would have been delighted at the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at each move.
The Rangers may have had most of the balm, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave the ball off for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in his sight, but the civil society could not finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked at the back pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found at least that he was entitled to a fine when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of an hour of playing, but referee Steven Thomson swept away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot at the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who had previously been target at the Ibrox, was able to stop the headball of Lassana Colibaly and the tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria with ease.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the general game process, no one can deny that they deserved this, even though it was just their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not up against the deep pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who stepped the ball in the finish with ease.
Gerrard made a break with the switch Colibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly race away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, whereby Lithgow and Halkett continue to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor stood up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a fine after a hit with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom TELLEN well... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has not been able to think away from science since then, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you'll hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: 'It's really banging now!'
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill malignant cells
Vaccin learns immune system to identify malignant cells in the context of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to turn them into a lab
They can then 'see' a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then re-injected
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that the immune system learns to recognize malignant cells saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells from a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all kinds of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 'stimulates the growth of various types of cancer', including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and "learn" these cells to tackle cancer cells has been shown to work earlier in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West turns pro-Trump-tirade off and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That wasn't the way he hoped.
Kanye West was issued during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an inconsistency in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was going to be presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he turned a tyrade against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
‘When I talk to a white person, ask him: ‘How can you be sympathetic to Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been out of America for a long time," he said.
The Saturday Night Live broadcast began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon set the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Commission for Justice in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The tyrade of West was not broadcast, but comedy Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stick the dragon with his post with West.
West also complained against the public that he had been taken backstage for his cap.
‘They have been riding me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on the stage with that cap."
They fought me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examer.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?’ He said he would put on her superman cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came at least twice a bully and the castles of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine received from a present to hear: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was guest as last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: 'To one of our bravest spirits: AGAINST YOU THE MASSA TROTSE'.
But talkshow-presenter Karen Hunter tweet that West was just 'just himself, and that's wonderful.'
‘But I choose not to reward someone who damages, supports and spits out an ideology that damages my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We, too, added them.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the creature that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also bore the name Snoop Lion and the deceased music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then into The artist formally known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after strike in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was put down on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear Monday before the police judge in Belfast.
The accusation will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington brings out toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out to the macho's stereotype and says that young boys when they see such roles on the screen often think they must be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that "something has gone wrong" and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he was strongly convinced that the problem should be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me at the moment: where has our masculinity gone wrong?' he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, so we are now facing this problem?"
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, by its very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is inborn and what is learned?’
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
'Cause something's clearly gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequeels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, for he is 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November on, Kit will be playing in a Revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I've survived my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded with an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people running up HIV in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of land would mean that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff worker leaked data from Republican senators and extracts from 'hazardous lies' and 'complot theories'.
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against allegations that one of her staff members has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the accusations are spread by 'extremely right' contestants and websites.
'Legends, lies and more mean lies', said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and the private phone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pound and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the office of Waters and contained the information of a staff member of Waters, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My fellow worker, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The statement of Waters quickly encountered criticism online, including by former press employee of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry,' wrote Fleischer.
‘From this you can imagine that she does not have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not get angry.
He doesn't have to rebel.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must stay calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Holy, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
'We will make the perpetrators know,' she said, 'and they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff staff.'
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that is indeed applicable to this revival of Johnny English-franchise, the comic action films with a sleepy spy in the leading role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was reintroduced in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy eventyre about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with his captivating eyes and flexible visions manages to send everything in the hundred, including with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a common comic character designed for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a grain of that guy who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire theme number during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV spots (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and hit the rotor blades against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson can well show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now the "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems to be for children rather than adults, and the mad disaster of Johnny English is less original and focused than the jokes without the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all the active secret agents of Great Britain known, to the great horror of the agent in office, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that causes the bucket to overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terrible unpopular like politics. Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she has to use a retired spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English herself, who is now working as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but not officially teaching about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spying of English reminds you of School of Rock.
English is quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former sad little help Bough, re-played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-moving femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin by their odyssee of crazy dolly fun: dressed as waiters they burn a cautious French restaurant, they kick herb aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English sparks pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For that latter, all the registers are opened, but however well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, she does some thinking about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which British work four days a week but are paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which British work four days a week, but were paid for five days.
The party is said to want bosses of companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea ‘fits’ into the party’s economic agenda and the plans to make the country’s balance sheet shine in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Trade Union Confederation, which feels it is a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at one time at another, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more beneficial to workers and also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the entire Labour Party is not yet supporting the efforts.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a policy intention of the party and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to make his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy clear.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'faceless drivers' and the 'profiters' in utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply "reductions" on the basis of observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds (including Ownership Funds) which give 10% of private sector shares to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raised the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, undecided."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is fixed and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform, and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizens Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which was organised for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, giving a telephone call or creating awareness in another significant way for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens Festival been, with 12 more years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'clickivism', giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, targeting a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than 37 billion dollars to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, of which at least 10 billion have been paid out or collected by sponsor actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realize their full potential.This group has promised Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with nutritional interventions.
In answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on the Global Citizens website, which asked "why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult path, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like the civil rights and anti-parliamentary movements in front of us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists that will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington may resort to the Navy 'if necessary' in order to prevent Russian energy from coming to the market, including in the Middle East, stated Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Internal Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to prevent this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinc spoke for invited persons during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit-making group that looks like the 'voice of energy consumption' in the US.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran and noted that these did not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a little bit of art, with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'unfit' Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trum of Berlin says has made Moscow's 'capture'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues as an argument that the strong opposition of Washington against the project is directed solely by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutsche Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she was 'thinking about it' to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman is in the top position," she said, according to the political newsmagazine The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll think seriously about it to make myself elected president."
Warren fought against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he was "turning this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm upset to see what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and on Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we have to wait for the FBI's investigation before we vote on it."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own supporters believe that it should not be elected by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion poll of the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of being elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, 38% before a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Praying said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSS at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he took up service in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience, what he's going through now he's back, I understand for other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and are harder, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the homeland".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and attack on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the US that refuses asylum to victims who are fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement to the Washington Court of Justice last Friday to support an asylum seeker who is fighting this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union had filed in August against federal policy has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang have abused her" but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's been detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people came from seeking asylum in the US, as countries with major gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision, enabling immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores ten years of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" in the statement of the "friend-of-the-court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy that prevents immigrants from accessing the US is damaging the US economy, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides for the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges in June to stop assigning asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political concept," said Sessions in his announcement on June 11 of policy.
Asiel was never intended to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, which people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her fevery baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new corpses arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their devastated homes and searched in their soaked possessions for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and the hospitals are overpopulated, as far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the remnants of a wall," said Haris to an Associated Press correspondent and added that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newsmagazine placed a four - page advertisement in an American daily in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were praised, the U.S. ambassador in China Beijing accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the U.S. Congress elections of November 6, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the elections in the US, marked a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed more and more import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "doubles the intimidation now by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register" wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will find a kiosk in the centre of Beijing in vain differing votes and you will not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newsmagazines refused to publish his article," as he did not say at which newsmagazine this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans estranged female voters just before the interim elections, warning analysts
Now that many important Republicans stand around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will experience a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions on this subject have risen enormously and most Republicans have already announced that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he was wondering if the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republicain, Arizona) to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven't forgotten it tomorrow, and they haven't forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning protesters called "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, on the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating women voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the President".
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans were to press through the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is in court, but it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly to the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided by the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority standing out on the side of the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe Ford's testimony and that 35 percent certainly believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the advance of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of drinking when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a party in the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be saved in this list.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it fully depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment by means of data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company supplies the resources, processes and skills needed to make solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have talks with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all their business models on their heads at once."
"We don't ask for their consent."
In a post on Medium that was published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after the start of Inrupt.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergy and Carrier of Victoria Cross from WOI honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had the highest British military honor.
A commemorative stone was revealed by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under intense fire from field gun and machine guns".
He later stormed on to the fire line and led the line forward before running only to a field gun and shut off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions "were something I know I can never touch on it, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed up all night looking at a full-throwed Bellator 206 and you don't get to see the most important moment.
13 battles, including six in the main section, were mentioned on the San Jose bill, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake for this fight all night long.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no more content should be displayed which is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa got pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said that they will adapt their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the competition, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these weren't all just as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise this won't happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary education, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that the parenting had helped him to put less emphasis on winning at the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of illness.
Appearing as a combination on Laverne's first program, Daley said that during his youth he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day are those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, real facts that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," so he wouldn't let people down if they finally found out about his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a striking campaigner for the LGBT community and has used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised him'.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young," he took part in his first Olympic Games at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at 40 years of age, after having received the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing really stunned and he died, I finally could admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamt about this all my life. To dive for a home public during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, which had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the biennial event, a record, was put on the bench by the team captain Jim Furik for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is suspended.
Because he was never known even on the top of his career for his right-wing drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs is routinely punishing wandering balls.
And if the job itself is not dissuasive enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday comes the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans behind four points start at the beginning of the 12 single matches, the Mickelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Fürik has shown confidence in this man, although he could honestly find it difficult to do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on the back, hit his arm around me and said he's ready for it tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play only two matches.
I had expected more, but it's the way it is, and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely equaled the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal matches on his name, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain irresistible impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to play jokes with people and he's a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy sometime last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than only his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
Deen made his debut in the competition in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here, after seeing the 2018 light win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others on the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Get to work and carry out the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and we must keep on focusing on that.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this field.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual performance will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone, your skills as a golfer are really being tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he'll have to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furik, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furik himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've tuned our line-up to this and sent the men on the way in the order that we believe is the best and, you know, we're going to try to magic something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and Rory McIlroy is putting in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have entered service in 2014 to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newsmagazine Die Zeit that quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014 but the disturbing post-supply problems have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful canon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
Last year, the fatal frigate F125 already caught the headlines, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were used in a battle mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, helping manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is seriously overweight, which will reduce performance and reduce the ability of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including crew training, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzying €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip become extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy is "a shortage of employable ships".
The officer said that over time the problem had grown as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of operation but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a estate in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the common and the small dwarf bat, the brown large-eared bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
Staff members of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with the help of manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the screams of the bat and what kind of thing does.
A map of the habitat and a report is then produced to make a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the making of pastures and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting dormitory and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, such as fly catchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are actually not blind.
Their night - hunting habits, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of dormitory and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at Three in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Three, we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known, and that's why the work we're doing here and at other locations will help us to better understand what they need in order to thrive."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a dormitory can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boy, possibly eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to harass them or to disturb them or to destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo allegations of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations were published.
The top of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, mentioned several hours after the accusations were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous by calling me my name, but that's part of the trade.
I am a happy man, and through and through good," added the football player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a trial in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an intolerable report of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the football player wants to compensate for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident was reportedly held in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the football room, where he raped her according to the accusation anal, as read in the charge filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that it has had some sex, but that this was with mutual approval.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-law settlement because she was 'fearing the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old is now saying that she wants the scheme to be declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of going from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left this summer to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will always regret it' as car producers leave
The United Kingdom 'will always regret it' if it loses its position as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that the "careful" thing that Toyota UK had said against the BBC was that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of delays at the border would cost in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis are made from Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Great Britain crashs from the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns concern the car manufacturers are about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts arrive from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be uneasiness at the borders which industry believes may lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the factory in Derbyshire, so the company informed, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exact to avoid those border controls'.
"We must have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with these very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the competitiveness of the company and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is representative of the union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'a further week' while the fight continues over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump will discharge the Deputy Attorney General and thus endanger Mueller's independence has kept the Washington gossip machine underway for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of holding a microphone to record talks with Trump and to drop the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors rounded that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a one-week investigation into the accusations against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's head of press, appeared on Fox News.
Asking for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'd like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the 'attractive' TV journalists, although she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than the only president for him," she said, without providing evidence: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot, and you've often seen us do it over the past few weeks and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with poets visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made a frank and bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to employees of the NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also put forward preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the activities of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is sure to be your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major injury
The Tennessee State Tigers liner, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodore game, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly for rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell more or less into it," Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline, before they put him on a stretcher and took him with them for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was beaten in a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in empties is imposed on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher empties when they buy a house in the UK and the extra revenue is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell this on many earners.
The increase in empties is imposed on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being invested in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The supplement, which is on top of the current empties, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, can be up to 3%.
In this way, the Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foothold on the ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson pleaded for a reduction of the emptys to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding the prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable houses in order to restore the 'houses for housing' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking range of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to disfellowshipping 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the 'British Dream', that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of ever owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over the head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is Scotland's managens."
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it's his 'ultimate ambition' to become one of Scotland's managers.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One, in three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiercy last season St Mirren.
"As a football player, I already wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the stockings was over," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw my father Scotland playing often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps putting on me.
However, that possibility would not come until I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, earlier he had refused avantances of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me are currently being measured by "Can I let this club return to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I return the club there."
Ross is only three years old in his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from the third division and transformed St. Mirren from the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a football player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads" he remembered the moment when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did fine, I earned quite well, and I knew some reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There are a lot of things you're confronted with weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm so good at my skin, as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The summer heat wave has increased the revenue of British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover increase by 2.7% in July, but the revenue in restaurants was 4.8% less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting firm, who collected the figures, said: "Ongoing sunshine and the fact that England participated longer than expected in the World Championships meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when the pubs had 2.8% more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now getting even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at selling drinks performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at the sale of food members also from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people were just going out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drink sales were 6.6% higher for the month, while food sales were 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industries, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for the turnover in the outgoing market.
It is no surprise, therefore, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% annual turnover is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food operators and only time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give the so necessary response."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Box Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a joint turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, accounts for social media they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools found that 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half agreed to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish athletic board
Eiligh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish athletics, as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn about her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help manage the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could not walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been very hard work, but I have now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
Advertisement for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has the online opinion distributed with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with cows being milked.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, consumer technology manufacturer, has issued an ironic, music video inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to battling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pomping, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the ad, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, immediately provided an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it condones the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they have to become and be given birth in order to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of delivery" is written in a response.
Elvie’s breast pump fits discreetly into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This advertisement is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilarious'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genius product" someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, focused on moms who are battens (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they're just "cooking".
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who struggle sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a feeding bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on batons.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between battalion mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the batons and the associated challenges in the spotlights, and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children in prison has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government make it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to put their own chance of staying in the country at risk by logging in for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albumence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the congress that his organization had arrested dozens of people who had registered as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior record.
"Up to 80% of people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of it are criminal strangers.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albumce.
In an attempt to speed up the process of children, officials have introduced new rules, which require some of them to appear before the court within 60 days of the start of the detention, which was previously the standard, according to the employees at the Shelter
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, instead of in person, in order to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for help will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or attempts to flee, according to the employees at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns were stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria recommends that the US, France and Turkey should withdraw immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem, also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war is in the country in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moulem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly training and advice the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war - torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moulem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he deems 'some Western countries to spread irrational fears' so that most refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be available to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is concluded.
Diplomats from the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned off a major attack from Russia-supported Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who 'will be eradicated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Deputy, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of government members and the opposition to draft a constitution after the war for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made it clear the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to 'the revision of the articles of the current constitution' and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency would be terminated early by a démocratisation procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you've been watching that you've been looking at a panel expert discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who are talking about Paul Manafort's jack of peacocks that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of overconfidence' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
Anyway, I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that it is a reality show, is partly that he stops you from something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (fighting with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praises).
You can't afford to miss a episode or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside looking at MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not pull himself off the screen with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all those weird shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a recasting of a constituency which requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The newly reclassified district of Pittsburg is the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must accept it against another sitting national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who has much overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January held that the old districts were unconstitutional ('gerrymanding') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a fight in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a naughty victory in a well-regarded special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US is considering punishing El Salvador for support to China and has waived this
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision no longer to recognize Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in American aid in 2017, for control of anesthetics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, some government top officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, thus making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further relief, without any harsh messages on Washington sanctions.
A spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of Trump to justice, for which serious evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on the cooperation between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must account for that institute, just as he is ready to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a court.
These are a lot of mites, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that of its equivalents in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
It accelerates or slows down the course of history around such bending points and the inexorable march of democracy.
Americans are currently faced with several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of examining Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested taking talks with the president in secret and that he had speculated about the suitability of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is wrong.
"How will we react if the FBI's new requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if it is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I don't think we're gonna fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers get Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory on the Austrians places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Because of a kneebleasure, civil society player Graham Dorrans could not play his first race of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use it as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good 11" said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but seeing a game all over the game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it's going to be a tricky game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the public is going to be behind us, I'm sure we can push through and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, leave behind the last season and become successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide research said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't express your wishes well in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arms: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a long-term hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use own funds as insurance as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance is to be used.
Ensure a proxy for health care, so that you can designate a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider, too, a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Set these details in a written plan, so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medications are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that the plan comes."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, 40 plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'voluntary act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu after the disaster took place.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami beat.
Donggala is a regent that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The government, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit regularly for the last hundred years by tsunamis, according to the Indonesia disaster control agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed a total of 226,000 people along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that took place on the south coast and took almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Regent in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as the people were reminded of the devastations of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people found death through crashing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, is arrested for accusing domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference on a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the judgment, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the report of the police, when a woman known tried to call the police to report the alleged offenses, he took the phone off her.
Palin is held in custody in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a bail of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself "unguilty, certainly" when asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A crimes, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and up to a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B infringement, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is being charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreatment of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now for the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of mistreatment in the domestic atmosphere, interference on a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group after having linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, which he would have survived his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are disabled while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people, a rare punishment that has not been executed in that state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charges, used a rented truck from Home Depot to make an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, reversing pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'willfully' killed the eight victims and 'willfully' caused serious physical injuries, according to the statement of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
In both cases, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the charges with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation', according to the prosecutors, and it described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'heavy, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernnan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years since a case was found in New York's Southern District in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being sentenced two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his action, she the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not plead to be guilty of charges of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "of course disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life-long prison sentence without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," said Patton.
The defense of Sajpov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilise a "people's army" during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he be given the lead of negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the Mars in Birmingham that the UK 'would have already been out' if Mr. Farage Brexit had been Minister.
But the challenge that May is facing in the reconciliation of the strongly divided ranks is highlighted by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Fellows insisted that she would continue and try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'Chequers into the trash basket'.
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were out of service, we'd be out now," said Bone.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash basket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists going from door to door and ensuring that we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians must feel the 'heat' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we're not letting you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: "I want you to set fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has brought us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this march with a meeting of two hours in the city center.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour House, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans "to think well" about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll be 'thinking well about her candidate for the presidency' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critique of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican Member who co-chaired Trum's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she could possibly fight Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came into power.
A present asked her if she would be elected to the presidency.
Warren answers that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man shown in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in the head and died of the consequences of it," told police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has known to have been present at the crime scene, to have been in possession of a gun and have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson is arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1,98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has let him win after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit and let Hamilton drive in the crowd's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later in the pit and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top of a wheel-on-wheel action which forced the Ferrari rider to relinquish space on the inside after a double movement in the third bend.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was the leader of the race for a while, because he remained with his tire choice and was targeting fast finish, so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pit in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did his best the whole weekend, he was a real gentleman and left me over.
The team did its best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she insisted on not being the source of the leaked letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Commission. Instead, he indicated that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be "common, untrue and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and leaks and then they say 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the accusations to the address of Kavanaugh were mentioned was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her desk was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with it confidentially, and I treated it confidentially, as she had requested."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night, "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further, with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unkindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and get the control back" the president would have said according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have offset the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals leading by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team side by side before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen with two goals ensured victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keepe, who had to make up for a delay on Friday night to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, during which the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistant with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt made the lead for the equaliser of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants entered first rest with a jump, when he made his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to a level with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He won the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next Friday game.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that an airplane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the tip of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gnwan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild traffic tower moving from Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He continued to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was ready for takeoff at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was on collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter Palu reached.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll can rise to a thousand and the agency for the fight against country disasters informed that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"People assume that the death toll is still rising because many bodies are under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have devastated Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35 years, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is engulfed in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the present military: "I call on you all to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the lowered plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had become watered during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What the crash has caused and what the exact order of events is remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the American Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told us that he himself and some others managed by waving the water that came to them to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a not serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen working nearby on a yard also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the about 30 metres deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data show that in the last 20 years 111 people have been killed in crashes of air carriers registered with the PNG, but none of these relate to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitor on Friday in the re-opening trial of a man accused of the living burning of a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a few hours-long witness as a witness in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone call records of mobile phones to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left her life.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bench on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they only knew each other one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hip hop is estranged from the origin with political opinions and the mapping of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a resurgence in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A children's woman from New York sues a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York child woman sues a married couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving an errant text in which the mother complained about ' another such black'.
The couple deny being a racist and call the trial 'printing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negroid woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEE WERE SO'N ZWARTE', wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper The New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt 'uneasy' when she realized her blunder, dismissed the plasco-Flaxman when she realized her blunder, saying that her former child woman, who was Afro-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a workday and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice sues the couple in court to get a compensation of $350,-- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bake internally with the family, although without contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do that,' said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple beg from themselves regarding the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after, by having offended her, she was afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists,' husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone you had insulted, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Compared to ' extortion' on the case, Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where they are hectic for their behaviour and reasoning.
The editors of Paddington feared that the public would not be very interested in a talking bear, revealed newly raised letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: 'It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, before the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it's very enjoyable."
She told her father who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman worked at the British radio station BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bitter sweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes her as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you're proud while you've done nothing for it yourself.
I think he's about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he himself honored the bear for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was expected not to make it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad's call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly developed and left her body.
She had died for some time before, and this process turned everything off.
I could only sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't cry, scream, or cry because I was in the middle of people and families.
I really had to be big."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the death of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to face.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Routing women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make themselves strong to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys stick inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis was her son, Tyler, 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with a catchy grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said his smile lit every room."
Yet he stopped working before he died because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he robbed himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a chain reaction."
Mrs Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, did not lose Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt gloomy or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was on the ground all the way on Christmas Day - when the children took out their presents he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to process it, "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we must all continue and continue to fight."

Board Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could actually get to each other what he is asking for; an investigation limited in time and size, then perhaps we could create a little more unity again', said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other', amid a firmly anchored patchage within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reticence has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections have been seriously hampered in five weeks' time, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing bad, their attempts to get their husbands elected to the highest court in the country will be made difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife Ashley, who was the Bush' personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republicans and 49 democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote decisively to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of overflowers in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean survivors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Einwording, states that there were 1,127 overflowers last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang hasn't responded in public.
In the end, the vast majority of those who have been overrun from North Korea are offered the South Korean nationality.
According to Seoul sources, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the overflowers to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often resorts to violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally in a state of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, with a focus on the stagnant negotiations on de-nucleization.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the US, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed largely to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of a lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without belief in US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,' said Mr Ri, during a speech for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Delegates, Nancy Pelosi, called candidate judge for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical', said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh excused the allegations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; sometimes he almost screamed and was upset when he told about his family and high school.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'gross and coordinated murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi explained that she found Kavanaugh’s testimony to be unfit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats', says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to initiate an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving', Pelosi explained.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would go against the 'Abfordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (Law for affordable health care) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about the review of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to be delighted if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a righteous tyrade of months and years of convulsion that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're gonna cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who told her that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method where she would cry every time she got angry. To the one she spoke with, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially lawful as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best memories from a former job, in a men-dominated office, was when I had to cry badly because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a cold business manager who was a bit afraid of everyone, grabbed me in my neck skin and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidate for the Presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cat' or 'public relations') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not stand for herself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
'There were 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fund recruitment, so she promised not to join in solemnly if she could not bring up $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"May they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she suffocated in it.
'People will have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder remembered about how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can be beneficial to Beijing
The opening salvos of the US-China trade war were overwhelming, and although the struggle has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries, according to experts, could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, gave the first warning earlier this year by increasing taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed to 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods from China's US income.
Beijing has taken every time in natura represailles, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised to equal the US every time, and the world on a second largest economy will probably not blink with its eyes fast.
In order to make Washington bend, requests must be granted, but public bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is playing smart, the trade war with the US, China could support in the longer term by reducing the mutual dependence on the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which would allow one of the two countries to fall into an economic free trap, is really far more dangerous than spectators have recognised', says Abigail Grace, a research worker of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specializing in national security issues, focusing on Asia.
Syria's 'ready' to return, according to Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, stated that the situation in his country was improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,' he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that some six million people still live in the country, who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' to the southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six successive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish commander Thomas Bjorn won the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, left his long blow from the tea in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who once reached 5–0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The top-class player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a hard year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emmotioned Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the torch to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel because I defeated Tiger Woods. I always followed that guy when I grew up," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furik, said after the disappointing performance of his team, 'I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
A short time this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We were in opposition.
All due respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their commander.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
