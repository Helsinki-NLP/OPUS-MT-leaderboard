Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33-foot walk ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in the sight of the older town hall.
Two plants so close together: intention or tortoise stroke?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Gutach's mayor.
"The town hall lamp was installed at the time because it secures the school route," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights ensure both cyclists and bus passengers and Bergle residents.
The system officially commissioned yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‹Grub‹.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come to their safety," Eckert says.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"Current measurements run through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," said Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a circular traffic was also remembered, however because of the narrow in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße were rejected again.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested at the location selection of the traffic lights: "With an extra transporter loaded with particularly long trunks of wood, we have distinguished whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning around the traffic lights".
The approximately 15 000 euros expensive traffic light system itself is the "modernest thing there is currently on the market", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights from the drivers can be well seen, for example, even when the sun is deep.
And it is also economical: the older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the traffic button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, it immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be stopped.
"If a group or people with disabilities were to cross the road, the green phase would be extended, so everyone would be safe on the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver had to think along as a partner here and watch the roadway.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly shown the traffic lights for pedestrians green, a super-class vehicle came through - with shining red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth by the soul for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner Prizewinner is known primarily as prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresachter presents for his performance "weather Lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosetexts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibigene" (1987) with proseminiatures from "Leichnam, his family bewildering" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a broken sofa, on which it is clearly copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher doesn't seem to trust the text.
The 70-minute performance overthinks the template with a wealth of directing influences, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic play forms.
In particular, the actresses come up with the sometimes questionable scenic implementations.
They are hit hard, dipped under water with their evening seals on the wall.
Imprisoned in cellophane or bodice, they stoop on dangerously high stems through the staging, either monologize them loud or lie completely muted on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance calm down, and Winkler's subsequent absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a money source to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be placed in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every drive and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the journeyed kilometers – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax records.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while there is no agreement in Congress on action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’ll only use if possible,” said Hasan Ikhata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driving miles for all California drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by the taxes, is calling for the US-Americans to pay on the pillar.
In America, however, no more is being darkened than before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
At high seed prices, politicians do not dare to raise the tax even to a cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most useful alternative in the long term," he said.
Officecrats call it a mile-based user charge.
It is not surprising that the idea is addressed by urban liberals, for for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and air-conditioning emissions.
California planners are relying on the system in the preparation of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally established goals of the State on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees in it the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having riders paid for the route they had taken.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Reason's Directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, who in a report in 2011 asked Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and responded to the concerns expressed by representatives from rural areas who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, who currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could track each of its movements.
"Thinking about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test came, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the loggers into adult surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking forward to affordable technology, with which the state can capture the traveled kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That would make the public more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not take place to help states to tax drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take a foothold in a emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers are to pay on the basis of the driven miles.
But the devices tested by it are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, major mistakes have been made.
There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting to give drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee on the basis of the miles driven on average by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrusted public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer ones.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which can also pay parking fees, an insurance must only be paid for kilometres and speed data collected from other vehicles in real time, which allows drivers to avoid traffic jams.
"Motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, drivers would participate", says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials stated that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankruptcy Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Law and Public Affairs.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats Wacker
The volunteer fire brigade dealt with her autumn main sample despite the lack of staff.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise acceptance.
A short cut is said to have been made there during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the development of smoking, one of which was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of Hans Kammerer's situation, two of the Wehr's respirators made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase could also be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machinery for woodworking.
The first attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place via an overfloor hydrant in about 100 meters distance.
Now three deletion attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also interested in the exercise to show what staff could be achieved with little available staff.
In a serious case, support is provided through the Königsfeld daily deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking universities and companies important
On his visit to Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, Landtags President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the labour force of tomorrow came from.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, he joined the executive school directors of the vocational schools and the Kreisgymnasium and the parent advisory board members in examining this important question.
"Education is an important location factor", underlined Claudia Stänle, director of the Hans-Thuma School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre in the Waldstadt.
He also praised the family kindness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a view of the family phase, but also the phase for caring for family members due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also argued that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often retain the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the country's president.
It is only if sufficient training places are offered that the need for skilled workers can be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable position in the south-west of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Continue to be persistent and ensure that public transport improves," he explained to the local politicians present.
Experienced with music an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger Seniors to coffee, cake and afterward a Vesper.
In the past the older fellow citizens were welcomed in the rest area.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the St. Josef nursing home.
Homes were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich had common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school yard to Kirchstraße is to be placed again on the reconstruction plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was built during the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, to stabilise and static relief of the over a hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the Landesdenkmalmamt provides for further action to include in the planning and to create a rehabilitation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table to the Council of Municipalities for the decision and definition of further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is in the foreseeable future necessary to reorganise from the ground and put on new substructures as a follow-up measure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since no drainage is available, need to be rehabilitated and has a bow enumeration forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but at present the wall is not at risk of collapse.
A secure wall is a prerequisite for using a school yard by students, which has been done by the current fortifications.
The school court renovation was originally planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for film recordings, will be shared by the Landesdenkmalmamt.
If there are any regulations from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well renovated old school building with new aula, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now joined the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart Music University," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz site Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is a favorite for a direct mandate for the Bundestag election on 22 September, the Green-Red Land government.
On the basis of an expert study, this requires a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the Jazz and Pop programme will be transferred from the Music University of Stuttgart to the Mannheim Music University.
US border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
According to the data, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar," said the U.S. attorney general of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the tunnel had ended.
To the drug gangs Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access to a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters and a width of 90 centimetres.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three threaten to be the highest penalty of life-long imprisonment, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it has continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that such a tunnel construction has been found.
Cocaine is normally smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "deprivement" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes had since been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the US.
No details were reported to the arrested, at least one was Mexican, it was said.
You have to count on prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in more than eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in the document.
A document was produced in churches, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th, there will be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time, in Kirchen-Hausen.
During the anniversary, a number of events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Church houses will be held in July at a festival weekend from July 18th to 20th, the 1250th.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a celebration, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At this festival weekend is also the church-house church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of urban music in the new festival hall.
This is finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last September weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary a new chronicle is also brought out.
"But it should be a chronicle not only by Geisingen himself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leiperdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, and in 1974 today's space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and on March 29th has the banquet and then celebrates the District Music Festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this at the fountain festival from July 4th to July 7th.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then court.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
The reason for 2014 of this 1250-year-old to celebrate accordingly, in addition the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Council adopts railway lines
Should the railway crossing "Am Deer" be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
Schiltach must take over 220 000 euros for this purpose.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety at rail crossings should be increased - regularly, collisions of trains with other vehicles occur throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to take part in the costs by a third, and the rest will share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the council the particularities of the Bahübergang "Am Hirschen".
There, at the height of the tunnel mouth on the west of the railway track, the city plans to build an ebb.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those transporting long wood, could stand in the face of traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the following road in due time to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was controversially discussed in the council, as some councils questioned the need for a spread of roads: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, put the sentiment of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in the hands of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is regularly used for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
As it should be noted that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be given an important transport significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to make sure that the cost of spreading the road would be examined.
In spite of this, it was largely agreed that the necessary supporting wall should be built in such a way as to allow the city to expand the following road towards "Bahn stationstraße" for traffic to about 5.5 metres.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could, on the other hand, lead to a very different problem concerning the access to the strongly rising "Rolltzhäuser Weg" (Rolltzhäuser Weg).
The administration had had the remodelling plans examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg was still possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the road’s inclination could lead to longer vehicles.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility as a road builder.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood disembarkment and the bending work in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the rail crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other crossings, because there is a stop directly next to the centre to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be stopped at this point to the extent that no collision threatens.
Most of the time, approval was given to the reconstruction of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bade" the problem with up-and-coming vehicles, the councils said, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
As an unproblematic body, the body considers the reconstructions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
More than 1,000 planets with other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether at least there are lives on some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Do you want to search for gravity waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or after earth-like planets, perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are specifically raised by those responsible for the European Space Agency esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research a decisive step forward.
The budget for such "L-missions" is approximately EUR 1 billion each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas stood for debate, five of which have now come to the narrower vote.
Many bodies are reviewing the proposals, following on from the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions were selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise processes of the formation of stars from large clouds of gas - and thus also the formation of planets surrounding these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined in more detail in our closer vicinity.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could picture earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
In the end, too, this question should be an explanation of the conditions for the creation of life.
An important part is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its originated particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa provides the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come to be and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos arose through the big bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first part of the big bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M mission here, whose launch is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the competition.
In the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa", has the best chance of granting an L-mission, a demanding concept for the detection of gravity waves.
These include physical changes in the structure of space-time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proved to this day.
Elisha could do this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission includes a two or three probe detector, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on earth, it could also prove the waves of gravity created by the big bang and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four further proposals compete for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to track and investigate earthlike planets.
Among other things, proposals for the sampling-repatriation of Mars, for the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and declare before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a fidelity break and attempt to criminalise political opinion with criminal threat, in which no defense is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spying and theft of state property.
German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to do this."
Relations between the USA and Germany are under pressure from the claims that the NSA had heard Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone call.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament, who is head of the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if it was possible to "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a Green MP, published a picture of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs a assurance that he is "safe" there, according to the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and continuous" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home country.
However, he was affected by the global reaction to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations through an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines collects charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday said that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that if the fee was paid in advance, 25 US dollars were calculated, and 100 US dollars were paid for travellers who were only paying on the platform.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008 airlines started to charge for the first and second listed baggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore put as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way of moving passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee it's not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who would have made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge on the flight platform of Frontier, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the platform.
The new hand luggage fee from Frontier will not enter into force until summer, an exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often smear about luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to use them.
They argue that the transport of luggage should cost money and passengers pay this service if they wished it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new luggage charges to be a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, leave their fingers on charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fee for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully follows the additional fees.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit brought $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who once held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected on the platform if passengers faced the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest things I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see tooth gnawing and hand-grudging discussions on the platform.
'The plane was full,' he said, 'and the boarding ran as flattened.'
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and fill coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company had gone back.
Frontiers step to raise charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy them directly instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone farthest in this area.
In September, the company started to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
A third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve places only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
Revenue decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity decreased almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get hold of Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs Come From the Bible
About 40 women visited the last breakfast of this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the congregation hall was "spouses from the Bible" and "renewals from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the Church Council, went to the biblical proverbs after breakfast in a talk.
"The words contain ways of life, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like, Woodeye be watchful, as sheds fall from the eyes, an eye is cast on someone, the Lord gives it in sleep, his hands are washed in innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners about what saying it was.
The words of the Middle Ages were taken by the church councillor Christel Dehner: all good things are three, blue-making, something deficient.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrase she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously defined before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round were Mayor Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched on the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified as experts for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New to this is that the six-month courses end with graduations," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits are varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would become skilled professionals, who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the agency did not have to finance unemployment.
The industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA states that an 'internal mistake' and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on late Friday that a mistake had paralysed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not reachable for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency explained in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours, and this is still not possible for some users.
Previously, a speaker from the NSA had told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way compromised".
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hackivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In case of such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overburdened and the website collapses.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, the nickname of which was once No Search Agency (No such Authority), is now being found in the light of the public and looks at the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance programme in Germany and abroad exposed to sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about intelligence fueled initial speculations about the incident today being the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October around 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Director of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far responded to attitudes.
According to Felder-Bauer, this is one reason: "We have hardly any skilled workers in crafts, health care and old-age care."
Since September, seasonal jobs for staff in the hotel and in-house industry have been renewed.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.

Loss of profit on Bombardier after decrease in delivery figures and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % reduction in net profit after having been pressured by falling orders and extraditions for third-quarter aircraft as well as contract problems in the railway segment.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could be used for commercial purposes in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
On the pilot plane's young flight a month and a half ago, only three further take-offs were followed, which makes it appear questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his evaluation of "outperform" on "sector performance" on Thursday in view of the limited price potential of the stock in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures were expected in aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the trend in the transport sector," said Dorksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 moderates are so far, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet traffic aircraft are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and media that the programme was in the schedule.
"The test plane was no longer on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that during the service life of the aircraft ground tests and software updates had been started.
Every manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, whatever we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, it was said by company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether a CSeries aircraft can be operated 12 months after the flight of the first customer.
Bombardier explained that it was reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that the start-up is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Dorksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cent unchanged.
Sales fell slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he had delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order list in the aerospace sector was 32.9 billion dollars on September 30, and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results of our specifications were disappointing, but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace segment fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The volume of orders in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on September 30, and was therefore slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google financial director Patrick Pichette will switch to the board of directors.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management via the short-term news service Twitter reported that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man had also been killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. eyewitnesses reported to have seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the CNN station that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have cried out and cried to children.
There was a panic among the waiting people that many would have hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that, he himself had been taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures it was possible to see how many ambulances and police cars appeared in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were put in safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management via Twitter reported, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, made a long return.
Apart from landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, it was said.
However, several planes were also observed on CNN during takeoff.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned against police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to Underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug dependence could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug search could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials observed that Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine to the House of the attorney in Blackburn, Laguna, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the Bar.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
At the time, all four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a large investigation procedure on heroin and cocaine trade in the countries of the countries of the former part of the world, in the areas of the Heroin and Kokain trade in the United States of America, in the areas of the Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police had secured a total of £1.5 million and £ 200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be published.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced to three weeks of proceedings at Liverpool Crown Court in two charges for the disability of justice.
He admitted the cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage pot.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs had been discovered in its hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was under the 'inadvertising secret'.
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were assured and a hair sample was taken.
At the police questioning, he stated that he was going to run an office both at his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known before the court that he had called and informed important actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests, of what the investigators knew about them.
State attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not being broken."
Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal defender, as he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
Part of his messages were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He opposed the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to conduct their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus called his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehavior and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the border police in Yorkshire said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta lost this confidence and tried to shove behind the facade of his profession.
The Serial and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared guilty of conspiracy into heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five more persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and odd inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160-year anniversary, the song wreath Dunningen will frame two services with Franz Schubert's "German Fair".
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the audience enjoyed in spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary trade fair will be heard at the St. Martinus Church of Dunningen from 19 on the evening fair and on Sunday, October 27, at the service of St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Fair with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is listed in the context of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider the choir is accompanied by the Bläsergruppe of the music club Frohsin Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism softens confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the soul care unit Haslach (SE) will change its basics.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach were preparing for the changes.
Because there is nothing more to change the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
During the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is hesitant, but it turns out to be confident.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals about the future composition and the size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the soul care team ranged.
On the basis of a presentation, regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly adopted guidelines for mental care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
Then, as a parish, the SE Haslach will form a body of public law which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of foundations in which the priest's power is represented.
From each parish are to be represented at least two elected members, in which six parishioners are formed on site so-called community teams.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish church then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide for the preservation of accumulated assets in the parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then all the parishioners make, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone have been invested," relativized Haslach's parish councillor Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the committee in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves a task in 2006 to "become one, stay five" and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher soul care unit then responded to the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the municipal teams.
Preparations will be made at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pulllendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pulllendorf have to adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against SÜDKURIER, a four-member family of Pulllendorfer family costs 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the rising price is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is set each October by the four operators of the large electricity routes.
These figure the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can charge by a surcharge over the electricity price.
The boroughs of Pulllendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now it is necessary to calculate the actual payments before the city plants could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number more close to the 2 cents.
Lights on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What are you supposed to do - drive red?
If a victim has waited long enough for a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "adequate", which can be interpreted differently from one case to another.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before the traffic lights have to be expected to be unable to function.
However, those who continue the journey despite red light must be aware that they bear the full blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the case under negotiation, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of permanent red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light infringement.
The traffic light was not defective, but it turned to green a little later.
A ban on driving continued to save him because of the special situation - but the fine did not.
Municipal Council welcomes the solid budget
Whenever it comes to household council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration no longer knows of debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget at around EUR 7.6 million was more than EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus is due mainly to higher commercial tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth budget was also significantly above the planned values.
Instead of the 1.5 million euros planned, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher introduction from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment than planned has been made in the financial year 2012, there has also been a higher increase in the supply of reserves.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeve," said Gerster, looking at the financial statements.
He and the councils clearly welcomed the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon cost the citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has in the past been able to give up high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies had often been reduced by the country.
These grants from various compensation sticks are subject to conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, since in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have grants," said Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's story is almost twice as long as that of the Festival of Herbs, during which he was solemnly honoured.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now more than won choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his commitment to the club he received several awards: Jörg Koohr, Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cecilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented to him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His vocal colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association and a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st Autumn Festival was in the usual course: with the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, her brothers".
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared them for a little piece - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choir songs such as "Jägaufen" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, Far Far Away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Walk Through the Valley".
The song wreath Salzstetten provided the women's quota for the festival with its mixed choir and its group of women - the "imulschor".
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" of Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "imulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What's the Swob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" in his home, where the Volsmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children had busy lunch over well.
Children's Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and day care facilities in the customs room are being sent to post these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the institutions in the realization of their construction and beautification requirements.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Participation in the action can include all kindergartens, day-care facilities and baby cribs from all customs authorities.
If you have a building or beautification wish for your facility, you can apply with this messenger at the Black Forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth up to 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many diligent construction helpers.
What about the action day and the helpers?
With the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb, Bauhaus provides the material.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press is outraged by controversial media law
'We are in a frightening situation and we may ask ourselves, 'What does Parliament hold back from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow', was to be read in the paper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional?
"The law is draconic and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new Media Tribunal "will always be biased, for it is an extended arm of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government takes the new law 'the media effectively into a grip', whereas The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered 'a severe blow' and called the draft 'draconian'.
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they released security cameras that saw how the units sent to the crime scene supposedly robbed the luxury shopping center.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative to question even if the pre-loading was withdrawn after a call of media.
According to the new law, media houses can be charged with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "although a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have an devastating effect on the description of Kenya's 'living blogosphere'.
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation who calls Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"Leaves politicians to themselves, leads them to bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors," he said.
The Kenyan legislators have already attracted public anger in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and put their decent salaries back in place tax free of charge of around 532,000 schillings per month – they are among the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
In spite of the importance for the city and the football club, the official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports ground did not pay anything in spite of the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant celebration last Saturday probably everyone wished, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who came without umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This was the case with the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as with some speakers.
Nass was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks to all of us were Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and association members who came in.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The decent pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also honoured by the countryman Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the Urban Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, which announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Kluž reminded us that in spring and autumn, recurring weather-related influences so added to the original lawn so that he could not be played.
15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when the construction of a third place was thought of at the grounds of the football club or at the real school at Lake Salinen.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about the creation of an artificial grass sports ground, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken up two years ago when FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, promised a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place and approved the country funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros to the total cost of 560 000 euros, summarising Kluž.
The construction of the 68-meter artificial grass square took place on June 4th.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike stretch.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
To this end, the competent working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentarians and the federal police.
On the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, the issue should be double citizenship, with both sides having opposite ideas.
The SPD wants to end the pressure for immigrants born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the meeting order on Friday, the SPD supported its No to a car toll required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for diversity and therefore ecologically counterproductive", said the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasion on land roads, which are already accident priorities.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also only be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later stage," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hairwave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be really summer again?" was actually not the question on Friday evening on the open-air Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the picture gallery to open the "singing hairdryer wave".
Driver in case of accident seriously injured
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on her way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempen outer ring.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she looked over the incoming car of the 37-year-old.
It collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Konstanz: Locking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-track Reichenau road.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
There was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constant.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old behind the BMW.
A total of about 15,000 material damage arose, the police reported.
The road had to be locked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport eliminates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be any announcements like this at Vienna-Swechat Airport.
A large part of the speakers are thus lost - the noise level should be so significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the recruitment of announcements concerning individuals.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls.
Due to the disappearance of these breakthroughs - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers in one day - it is expected to go quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual transmissions have been relatively limited, but at the same time all other information on changed flight journeys or departure times are going down here a little," Kleemann said in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car draw with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6th to 8th September.
On Saturday, 7 September, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are fluffy in the cold yard.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines tree trunks, hoops and water egg bearers.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It's not a matter of width," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown vertically, once it is to be missed and then it has to be laid down.
This is assessed with most points.
The aim of hooping depends on the accuracy.
From eight meters away, a peg is thrown.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Training can be done as early as 10 am.
Desirable is a suitable clothing, for example, the competitors can compete in the Schottenrock.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
Sign-in can be done up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish- Swabian Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been announced on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the friends of the bubble music come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg designed the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays smooth polkas and marches.
Their repertoire, however, also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
With it will be Heinz Koch, known as a singing host and black sausage baron, from time to time.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the foolsunft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Linstetten will be holding the Frühschoppe, the Böffingen farm chapel will be a guest, and the "Oldies" will be the festival.
The stop-painter party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
On Saturday and Sunday, more programme points include the old-timer and tugs, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craftsman’s market and the sheepshearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw hill castle, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Multipurposehalle, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a Quarker set.
Furthermore, the Vegetarian League calls it World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On 1 November, on the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let be replaced by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk may be used.
Inflatable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable.
Lockers become dough instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, which is purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately went to Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the shift of time, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day at Times Square was decided.
Despite Shutdown, the second day the Statue of Freedom could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, the financial center around Wall Street went to the 11th of September Memorial.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the 373-metre high viewing platform of the Empire-State-Buildings.
Then, through the hectic driving of the New York streets, the Rockefeller Center went to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay in the autumn sun for a short time.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday schooling at Weymouth High School.
This year a Hubertus fair will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße on the name of St. Hubertus.
St. Hubertus was the sage of a rather reckless hunter, who was converted by a vision and was later appointed bishop of Liège.
The hunting hornwind group of the hunting riders Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musics on Parforcehörner (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog mutts on tow hunts musically.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu is called a psychological phenomenon, which is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the site in the district town of Kleve in view to the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with its beautiful name has the very goal: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but to make it always experienceable again and again.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A view into the interior life at 8 p.m. gives the viewer a good feeling immediately.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café-ambient looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team spoils the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individual fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves before the opening of the charming café on the site as a gastronomy: in Kranenburg they conducted the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the store, the friendly café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The friendly couple of owners is behind the coffee-genus.
Enjoys the fragrant hot brew in the various variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"For a baguette - this is my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
Better one.
The port festival took place outside rather - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring at night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that's why Daniel Büttner is not an outstanding fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always address only those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
To say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the store in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastroms and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club's venue of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious together in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is also always the right strength to honor.
About the special award "Singers of the Year" was delighted this time by writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written a lot for us, you have also turned a lot of rounds for us, for which we have a warm thank you," says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples were presented to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations.
==References====External links==
A special thank you, the board of directors addressed the team of club assistant Ange Pier-Ribert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets in the club's venue on Tuesdays at 7.45 p.m.
"We are welcome at all times to hear new vocal voices," Schlotmann says.
UN announces new poverty reduction targets
From now on, the United Nations is beginning to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty, announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the drive for sustainable development goals to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to embark on a process with which universal, sustainable development objectives should be agreed," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I shall not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball superligists continue to have a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes at all," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon is warning the pointing finger in advance.
Many players I have trained myself in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait for reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Most of all in the cover work and in the switching game, it had a lot to do with it.
The use of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
That's why I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President Mozambique to vote in favour of a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the title 'We demand security' in Portuguese and on Thursday she joins the crowd on the capital's independence place.
For almost two weeks there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it unlikely that the country will fall back into an adult conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coalfields in the northwest could in the coming years bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government had provoked recent conflicts by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesperson to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
Regarding AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama views himself as a "lost" who "will use all his remaining powers to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to the FT, he said that this meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again, seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of tensions fueled by a number of conflicts this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating, and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a debilitating movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), founded by an earlier Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity renamo has, but it has done troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which is located Beira, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga replied with caution to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased government frustration, says Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the slowing progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
"No interest is Renamo and Frelimo, they simply want peace and usable roads again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as models for life, says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks", and the art legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "by far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "cautious selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that for authors and teachers who were 'excessive didactic' children would 'turn off', because in entertaining stories the messages would be 'unswerving'.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English and was the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Valley, said: "One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background as far as possible."
The perhaps biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be understated, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
About 100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took up his retirement residence in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the very fun scene play.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actress Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which was much appreciated under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained interrelations and bridged time shifts from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then began the scene game, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as a great son of the city.
He stylized with Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-piece and Black Zwälder Füchsen.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippe welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put herself in the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimik and gesticism.
The Mühlenbacher Farmerkapelle played matchingly selected pieces of music between the individual play scenes and thus completed the performance.
At the time, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honor to the award of honorary citizens, who, in the representation of the then official owner Hättich, along with a part of the city council, made his appearance.
The three-king singers who led Hansjakob to the exclamation made their expectation: "Oh, how beautiful, there will be memories of my own three-kings alive again."
With their song "O Jesselin" they enjoyed the audience in the open yard as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out".
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the church, as had his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene play.
Many applause and many praises were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Growing
The chances for the league remain of the sportsly downgraded Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wild card procedure, then there is now less for the Neckar Giants a competitor.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project does not apply for a possible post-return site.
"We are not going to participate in the wild card process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
A first breath was nevertheless not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the wild card procedure until it was established that Düsseldorf was not granted a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, ascent Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and demonstrate its economic Bundesliga suitability.
To date, however, the Rhine countries have been refused the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Supper church at the point of view
As a contribution by the city to the 150-year-old existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public themes on Sunday, 27 October, the evening meal church.
After the visit to the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerlocher period is to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning endpoint is a visit to the Fendmahlskirche.
There the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a Catholic area.
Not least, the view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter also falls in the church.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half hour tour is at 15 o'clock at the Atomkeller-Museum.
Maps are available at the cash desk of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. craft in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Advocate General could either ask in writing questions or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency, calling on non-notified parties who were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved in the interstate, it was said.
A trip to Snowdens from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he lost his refugee status," the Agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, snowden there threatens extradition, it continued
Long Breath Makes Pay
Six men's teams fought for the title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had been received by the tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The tennis fun was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each one.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament was held in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
During the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking table to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful sound of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauerhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous co-mach activities and events.
"Great and small can learn various old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for every age the match is there.
The children are helping regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as push-car racing or stilting.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 a.m.
On a tour of the terrain, children have to find out which stories are true or yet lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals, such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens, are to be found and marvel at on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will drive his Schabernack with the museum guests from 11 am.
Cosy and fairy-tale in the meantime it goes to Hermann Büttner.
The narrator takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach presents traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 am to 5 pm numerous craftsmen such as the Besenbinder, the nearer, the spider, the weaver and the baker can be looked over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the Freilichtmuseum expect a varied holiday programme.
In a New Zealand small town Burt Muro is considered to be an adorable chew, because he has done his motorcycle, built in 1920, to participate in a race in America.
Burt, despite a heart failure, is not to be taken away from his dream.
With his savings, couple of donations, and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrill pinging disturbs locals
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the ground.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the camp in front of the dike.
Two huge blue semi-trailers and rechargers distribute or load the coal as needed.
Every move of the handling devices sounds a shrill warning sound over the terrain.
"The signals are for safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the face of unfavorable wind, this can be heard far - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will also rely on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
For Matthias Schrell has a lot more ahead of the site.
With the extension of the Mecklenburg Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the coal import for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18th-metre deep bed tub form terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can also be finished here for a long time.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark in the envelope," Schrell says.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the import coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the network, then 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloadings on the bridge and the second conveyor could create up to 10 million.
Bavarian basketball player despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not narrow the enormous optimism of FC Bayern Munich's basketball players.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," said Bavaria-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the champion Olympic Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first created the piece of art to convert a 15-point-resistance 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We fought back in an incredible way against the double Euroleague champion, but then again made frivolous mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichs, who celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian production champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd of jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headlines started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too familiar to perform in a club," said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be featured.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of comedians who attend the festival this year have become known for rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became familiar with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation at Saturday Night Live as well as at Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of the American Comedy.
One of the festival's biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the middle of Manhattan in the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he was here, then he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I'll live here.
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiations Process
Iran is showing itself one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN-vetomists and Germany is satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jjawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Killing Boys Game Camerals With Machete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to take them on a bird hunt.
Armed with machetes and knives, they surprised the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in front of their homes in a workers' district.
The body was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the youngster who had taken her away was supposed to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called it a rival in football.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth centre.
Prisoner must go to jail
Because of exploiting human trafficking, fidelity, threat, insult and dangerous physical injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorstep after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a process agreement.
Thus, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used resistance to break with violence and threats.
The revenue of women who had been buying for some years for him was retained.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undercut the contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had some of them monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court didn't have to hear any more of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four further cases of exploitable trafficking could be identified after an initial display by telephone surveillance measures.
The discussions that were stopped were marked by high aggression.
In later hearings, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women discovered blue spots all over the body, has not made any statement to this day.
It deals with "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this meteor as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has resolved from these circles and wants to live a normal life after prison," he said.
Oil price continues to reach 96 USD per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China is growing.
The reference crude oil for deliveries in December had fallen in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large range of crude oil has burdened prices over the past few weeks.
The US Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports on increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of the economy of China, with growth rising to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell at ICE Exchange in London around 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frysk program ("Slow and Browse") of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Appellate Court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken by the city.
The judge had judged in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the program for the arrest and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its Directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for American Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were misguided in an inappropriate manner to name black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frysk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras worn on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the appointment of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights fighters.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the non-party mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004 four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint which developed into a collective complaint.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force and influence the way other police presidencies use the regime.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen police morality, but not crime, and that money would also be wasted and would not solve the wider problem of a police that was under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice, which was constitutional, but merely reformed the way the NYPD implements the controls.
By the luck of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels succeed in achieving
The first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Handen" with this wisdom.
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman, Mr. Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He was himself for the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips on site.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic system and is now, according to Henne, planning to act in an advisory role with the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn in the record time of just under a week created the hospital in Socogim, a miserable quarter on the outskirts of the capital - volunteering.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, hen, for example deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
Furthermore, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical equipment, medications, associations, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided a rich local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauretania journey.
As his personal motivations, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson claimed to use "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false hint about an affair of the then Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Advocate General Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World had heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voice emails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court was told.
"In the public prosecutor's opinion, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of people's homes hoping to catch them up to fresh action, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumours of an affair Clarkes were first picked up by the feature editorship of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voice emails from their phone of at least three occasions was assured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time when the research was running, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities at this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted with a married woman because of an affair when he himself was lying with the fellow accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks dispute to conspire with others to hack telephones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, the French football will actually strike the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will end without results.
In the conflict over the Reich tax, the government and the professional football team in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed suffocation meeting.
President François Hollande received and heard their complaints at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies of the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the chief association of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days of play in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 are therefore out of date.
Gehingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve citizens early in planning," said Mayor Jens Häussler, opening the Citizens' Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häussler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which Gechingen met unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an incisive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, says Häussler.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built plots as possible is the goal," says Häussler.
Reference is made to the planning of protection against a flood that is statistically expected every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent supplement.
In specialist circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aClimate".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häussler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aClimate protection, around four million euros need to be invested in Gechingen, where the municipality can expect state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häussler pointed out that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the flow of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hoffsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
Moreover, it is necessary to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Disgusting was the case with those in the old town who, even in the event of normal thunderstorms, often suffer from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Häussler pointed out that the directive on sewer systems should be different from that for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that rain events could be handled for two to three years.
To dimension the wastewater canals larger would devour millions.
Injury after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say much at first to the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is fixed that the 19-year-old guide of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, where the woman was so severely clamped that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to free her from the wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained fully blocked for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a god seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprising the relationship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski with his massive oeuvre can be understood as the inventor and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security will and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He got it, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "minority report" dates back to 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like ours, mutants look into the future - and the police are attacking.
"We are seizing individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "In our society, there are no serious criminals, for which we have a prison camp full of Pesudo criminals." They read streams of time.
They assume that evil is happening, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophy and practice also works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is running through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
Not only do mistakes and sacrifices buy, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Spähfenfare um Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. special about Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Procuratorate could either ask in writing questions or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the Interfax agency reported.
Previously, Green-Bundestag member Hans-Christian Ströbele had met Snowden in Moscow yesterday as the first German politician to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen company paranoia due to State surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Anti-Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. foreign post located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a exchange of words between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use the possibilities of foreign spying to " steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became Whistleblower's former employee, began publishing his filler horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director's word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new high level due to state supervision.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was distorted, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be in sight, then companies are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it's possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost the same risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, such as a survey published by the consulting firm EY in July.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents sent through by Snowden that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policymakers have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet possibilities and should reduce its dependence on the USA.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, it would not have been allowed to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical refinement of the U.S. spy authorities exposed by the snowden revelations has shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is a major change because European business managers are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the case law and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, according to the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-resident members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who didn't exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this area of law?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage takes place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of companies usually does not boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, as this gives the advantage of an attacker.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or the unattended leaving of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors at car manufacturers Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access", warns the BAT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel, two of the countries serving to purchase economic data from hacking were classified in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate.
A member of the board of directors of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French indoor intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying out their allies."
Hechingen: Fair provides an answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has rebounded.
It's starting with the wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the often-smoothed and embroidered clothes are closed, often with a veil, on the other hand, they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
However, the spirits separate, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidmüller.
In men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen cream or brown combinations.
It was explained that the local choice was important.
Jewelryless side rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to pass by with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Cuts are also popular for young cell members," he says.
Romanticism is also needed for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion are the "After Wedding Photo" - in other words, recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the feast, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dog Friends Successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he took it to twelve with 87 points.
With their Woody in class 1, Susi Höpp presented himself with the critical views of the executioner.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled ringer mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family lawyer stated on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright mat standing behind the stand in the school gym.
The investigative officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, however, the family of the 17-year-old doubted.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Trump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never believed he died the way the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that it is not necessary for any logic to violate the laws of physics as well as the common sense," says Trump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is hidden in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and returned to the body bag," he comments.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unexplained.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, had another cause of death, said Moore.
'There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,' he said.
Moore added that if there were sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation to the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators checked.
The teen's parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained indications of how he died.
CDC publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children at schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US Government as the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teacher and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine more in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children with allergic reactions.
Children may say: 'It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue', 'My tongue feels as if a hair is lying on it' or 'My tongue is crawling'.
Parents of intersexual children can choose 'genderly undetermined'
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognised for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigid male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain gender to such children, but they can indicate 'undetermined' or 'undetermined' on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make overly fast decisions in relation to surgery for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain mutilated and full of scars, the flicking work created by doctors.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children every year is neither born as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that is subject to the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information for gender assignment, if a provision is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before choosing – if at all – an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law is "sounding after a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical surgery, but most children do not," he said.
One can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status was not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were evident in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairing, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination which is exposed to intersexual and transgender persons in working life and the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not agree with the sex picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or third gender on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court had granted life-long preservation of "undetermined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French delegates of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site has also spoken against German law, on the grounds that "if the world is being torn into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she found it better if babies are given a gender at birth.
"The parent's existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if one does not know the sex of one's own child," she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine considered the sex to be something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after now it is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was formal.
He coined the term "sex identity" and argued that social and environmental attacks – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, thus indicating whether a person views himself as male or female.
But in a case known as "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated during a seasoned circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have joined the public, which are 'not happy with the result'.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breast removed.
Because of the operation he has become infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, makes sure that the German law "can encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign a ‘undetermined’ to the child,” she said.
We're afraid that favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to recognize as a third generation".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force young children to do so.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "mighty" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the recipe order of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatric assistant.
Although infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a glue.
"The law provides room for parents, so that they do not have to make overturned decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write 'male' or 'female'.
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be reversed anymore.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are drifting around because they feel they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the gender that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown hurt girl by car shot
In one car, the unknown injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin.
That's what the police in Burg told us.
The girl was easily injured on the left bank.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police said it was Friday.
Until now, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to be egg-throwing children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains at the same time, no material damage should have occurred either.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböllers were also lit in the city area, but no material damage has occurred here either.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with paper and his radial blends were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his blinds in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue working.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamily.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of greenery, an old tree, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you don't fear spiders?" Waltraud Ries asks, pointing to a fat spider at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the concern that at age the many stairs to the house and in the apartment can no longer be handled, she explains.
In addition: Since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty has had to find out on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Recently, a book of hers was published on the subject 'Happy Living in Age - Which living form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't go at all in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the issue of 'living in old age' at all.
Most of them push it away as long as it goes.
Old always only the others,' she says smiling.
Only when suffering pressure is really great do you think about it.
'Then it can be too late too late', says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
'What type of residence you choose is always an individual decision' she explains.
D i e solution did not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, one can also agree in the Dolce Vita',' the specialist book author gives attention to resettlement volunteers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often quoted Rentner-WG.
At age, everyone has his ticks and macs like that
"For me, however, such a housing community would be nothing," she says with an eye twinkling.
Not at all like in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat rooms', says Ries.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to rule out the fact that an elderly community can work.
This must then be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest,' she believes.
With this view, it is not alone in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital.
Your service advises people on the subject of 'becoming older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also purchase inconveniences and restrictions to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today, there are many possibilities to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the remodelling of their homes or their homes should first inform themselves thoroughly and not order the first-ever craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for the old-fashioned conversion.
Even in the apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat rise, the interior architect explains.
But not always the existing apartment can be changed age-friendly and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase lift within the apartment, the path also paved with stairs up to the door of the apartment would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it grays more than before the spider on her door of the apartment.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its attitude toward former U.S. intelligence assistant Edward Snowden.
He would continue to be accused of not allowing him to pass on secret information.
Therefore, he had to face criminal proceedings in the USA, said U.S. Foreign Minister Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would the recent comments of Snowden change that.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's words were those of a parliamentarian, not those of a German member of the government.
In principle, Edward Snowden is ready to talk with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA staff member who was sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Advocate General.
After a translation by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the relevant staff
I was asked to write to you about your investigation of mass surveillance.
My name was Edward Joseph Snowden and was formerly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my work in these institutions, I became a witness to systematic violations of my government's laws, which led me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent hetaceous act that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have considered revelations to be a service to the public to be a system of comprehensive surveillance, which is not responsible for anyone.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while at the same time the risks taken into account have been clearly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has proved to be positive, my government continues to treat Distinct as a fidelity break and seek to criminalise and accuse political opinion.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this negative attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to take part in the responsible information of the facts relating to the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in a reasonable and legal manner.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden attests to Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the commune to a private person.
The Council approved the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "adequate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," says Maier.
In the household there were 100 000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
It is right for the mayor to have passed on the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer have to stand up for the entertainment of the house, such as heat, look at the garden and clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Square concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock stick at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to cope successfully with the first musician's cock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing bids with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most significant surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book that is about to appear, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had carried out "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out whether Obama's dwindling hope of re-election would be better if he had dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, national correspondent of the Times, the book closely traces the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and of the White House, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it had on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton with the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and the former White House executive advisor, David Axelrod and David Plouff – knew about the planned change.
'Double Down' claims that Daley had been at the forefront of the efforts to exchange bids despite their 'close, personal relationship' before one finally decided against such a check after the data showed that the candidate Clinton's 'not significantly improving Obama's chances'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually decided to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as 'the offered care', Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move was paying off in terms of the election.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin at AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss would have known about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not think that the president was "conscious" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it had been "possibility" that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that 'Double Down' did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama had not known anything about the investigations on whether to drop bids in the elections.
'Possible' Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was e-mail similar to traditional post technically implemented in the design of the Internet service?
In the design of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account when creating a stable basis for a secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user sends "Anna" to "Benni", then the computers of the two are directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from his provider.
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the web?
Most emails are read on the way several times by software robots.
With the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an annex.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also identifies the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their next holiday trip, Google can show corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The probability that unauthorised persons will read a mail is extremely low.
But this is possible theoretically.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal possibilities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal banishment actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against read-in.
With high technical effort it is also possible to mask the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the main privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen, GMail was able to expand significantly from Google.
Mother in the forest bewildered and retired
When his old mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash her pension and care money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after the police in the forest in order to continue to pay a pension and care allowance.
First, he hid the death of the 89-year-olds, and then he broke down the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noticed that the mother in need of care no medication was needed anymore.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was strange for officials, they continued to determine.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, there was no evidence of a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice-cream in the dark – with the help of shrieks.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining leak from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on torments and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, which increases the pH in the protein and triggers the lighting.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice shines.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market at Halloween, because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because it's four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is sometimes impossible because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals of which ice cream is made; but I guess we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a pain artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still in the handball league after six days of play.
Now, for the team of Ingo Ehlers, it comes tomorrow to the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the persistently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has available his complete cadre.
Daverden, too, puts us on a tempo game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which has left everything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season win against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're far from the favorite, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to go down in Morsum to start a series.
The lack of Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Jugendliche Joost Windsüß, who is active in the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever's not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I became a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself prepared to distribute from my apartment out of sweets, and I guess I won't do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the US-American Federation of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween then are the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to put themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk Space Men will make it this year in the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not tender.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, suckers, candys, and gums.
So good news for 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who are moving through the neighborhood with the saying "Sweet or Saures".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and eat – if we don't mind – food.
The only thing we don't want to consume is sugar sweet Candy Corn, but 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses in which it spits.
They have great names like 'Terror Behind the Walls' (which by the way is in a real prison), 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized ghosthouses in the United States that reach 500 million dollars of proceeds, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee into your pants and then place the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the guys you're standing on leaves a comment like "low facial expression".
But let's finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the big pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lattern is like the adorning of the Christmas tree – something we have made of small.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lattern, slowly rotting in the front garden, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something pretty out of their 921 kilos of heavy pumpkin.
Flat fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces are storing coal-cooled bodies
The fire brigade had to go out in Helmbrecht on late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the Hof district catches fire during the night.
The rescuers have a cold body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmbrecht, rescue forces have found a corrugated body in a three-family house.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as one of the police spokespersons in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building was no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest Landeskirche has launched an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of their present 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelische Pressedienst.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day processes themselves.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology according to the Abitur.
Burfien takes this back to the process of de-Churchification: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession was characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am lord of my calendar and can place my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a pastoral caretaker.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for this, theologians would have a safe employer.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not just about careers, but about a meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In thinly populated peripheral areas, such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may become difficult to occupy positions in future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite professionals who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a freephone system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support of bowler-works mechanics and logistic support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for Rally Raid's strategy and reality.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Called fire brigade for the rescue of a little dog 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky edge in a quarry
Cockerpaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her sick location
Firemen sailed off rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to secure a little dog that was stuck on a 15 - meter - high edge in a rock wall.
After a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon, the nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the Flapit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby again and to thank the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she had escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who performed his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sailed to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a couple of dog cakes.
That was a rather unusual commitment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge happiness."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary examination, but it did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To watch the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never put on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer to Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said that she ate dinner with the old rocker, and that "he put on me when I was 18.
She added: "That's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative named Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: 'Maybe she confused him with someone else.'
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones-Tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed at #1 this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling Gives the Scottish Election
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring about greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often make a firm approach to their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scottish.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means pass controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against the one in Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to unite Europe after the war has been launched.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
Throughout the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or wish to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euro-Skeptic Party was able to give almost five million votes for Germany – founded only this year – during the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively banish the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by holding on to the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and this is what German politicians would like to leave that way.
Without the possibility of depreciation of the local currency, Southern Europe can be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays double the amount of electricity and the fourfold for gas compared with the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry does not protect all world wage-fixing companies from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
The result is a revolt, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to lift Paris at an eye with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, with which the affected French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU enemy Front National has just won a decisive re-election and thus referred the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to put forward: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations" which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of getting involved in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – whatever it is to say to Berlin and Brussels, what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could drive quite well in a more relaxed European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries that think similarly is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalizing Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem-Coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, only to get a savings policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually it's no sign that puberty is coming soon," said Kaplowitz.
Clearly displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and arm hair as well as body smell, show up in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (a occurrence of the first bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "early puberty with girls: The Essential Counsellor for dealing with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually is the beginning of puberty, but it is true that the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth shift eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In case of faster advance tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and therefore small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is apprehensive about drugs, but he admits: "The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, to be different from their peers in old age."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter had been given her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no solid evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causes.
Boys come to puberty similar to girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who created a connection between body fat and puberty entry.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys have grown in the face and shame, the trend towards a full-scale previous puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is even common among babies and toddlers.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician as to how they should speak to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been an argument about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision on Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seat that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those most interested in the airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The challenge comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from November 17 to 21.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular if there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results to be delivered by the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that its modernized '777X' covers 406 persons in tourist class seats, which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane giants often share hoe over technical details by advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus is now calling on the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, showing a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you like to accept this?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
In view of changing diets, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, male average American weight increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the US Health Ministry.
According to U.S. health statistics, the waist size of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rivals adhere to a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly baptized 'Jet set' was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that show that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures to the seat dimensions and says that it is not at the manufacturer's discretion to decide how airlines shape the balance between flight rates and the facility.
The company also explains that, according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the size of the seat.
"It really is up to airlines to provide flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful," explains Kent Craver of Boeing, flight cabin expert.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it will increasingly be an issue that can affect turnover.
The challenge is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US$700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeing statements on the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore crushing more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggest that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
“eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat through the 777,” says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin facilities, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of subcontractors from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet-sellers even carry a band-size to track the establishment in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but according to its own statement no one has sold yet.
Until recently Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard would probably pump, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make smoking fun
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before tests on humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried out all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered with nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a "outtime", the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the level of antibodies that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibodies factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he is quite sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they feel no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to put off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi disputed to be influenced by Obeid
The former Minister of the Joe Tripodi Laboratory Party from New South Wales is under investigation by the State corruption authorities.
The former NSW minister argues that at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, the arrangements for the marine lease were amended, which had hidden holdings in three land on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigations on the question of whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without calling for an extension after their expiry in August 2005.
Now because of the accusation that Tripodi had known about Obeid's hidden interest in the properties after Tripodi's former deputy bar chief Lynne Ashpole had said accordingly on Thursday.
In many years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had insisted on public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted to extend longer periods.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the Circular Quay companies, which brought 2.5 million dollars per year to the Obeids, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public procurement.
However, he objected to having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had insisted on the reform of the government's leases.
One of the ICAC's telegraphs showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had been transferred to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the topic discussed in these telephone calls the preparation of commercial lease schemes?", Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked.
'No', Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between myself and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighters attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighters had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a leading government employee confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visa could be subjected to 'reality test'
The government is considering, within the framework of extended measures, a 'reality test' for foreign workers with 457-visuum.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former representatives of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments regarding foreign workers, because they could be seen as insult by Australia's neighbours.
"Open statements such as "foreigners are supposed to stand behind" and "Australian first" are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia Indian Institute today.
Historically speaking, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region confound an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigrant Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks about human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the 'reality criterion' is accepted, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see if 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally linked to the holder or to a relevant person of the supporting undertaking'.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally recruited hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumist probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine - year - old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England should be realized as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train link between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building high-speed roads between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in conversation with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacities and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network bringing the UK and its cities closer together."
We move ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: 'Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland.'
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to use "unmistakable" for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time also the economic power of Scotland is an argument for fast train connections across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, to create the benefits for all and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft shall remain in force provisionally in Australia
Australian flight passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch, or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "airplane mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoyed that they are not allowed to read their e-books at the start and landing.
Australian companies, however, do not follow any immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Aviation Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"CASA has currently no specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft", has been announced.
The subject is subject to provisions which, according to airlines, require the safety to be maintained at any time and passengers to comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already talked with CASA about extending his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, explaining that one is open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas explained that the current rules would be maintained except for further information.
"Our current directives provide that electronic equipment should not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of their fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases in poor sight, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended to store heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats at take-off and landing.
Before the revierderby against Schalke, co-responsible BVB adherents with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga football club against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras responded with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
To be heard were mostly the guest fans with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are, presented itself at first exceptionally quietly: No songs, no battle calls.
The Podest of the Capo, which otherwise co-ordinates the joint firing, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the stand, a large flag with the title "Section Stadium Prohibition" blew solly.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, burned short-term cheer.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and wailing scarves - but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Also, that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration noise.
It was only five minutes before the tap that the Capo reached its pod - and the tension that was almost reachable by then was revealed in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
At last, as always, the South Tribune was in the row - and at last, as usual, was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbywinners stand up" came from the South Tribune, everything was as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately in front of Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the fellow BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the crowd and into the square - almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was pewted late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of Dortmund's Ultras in his office - and if you think Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an emergency measure, Watzke banned the ultras from a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I prohibited that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishing - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a penalty by the end of the next week.
"That's going to be incisive," Watzke assured.
One may be excited about how the reactions to the South Tribune then fail.
Paid houses are booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
Janani Amirtzinga trades a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings in a panning house in the shopping center Bendemeer in Singapore to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, and I have all my money in it," says Amirtzingena.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and also worked her husband, she does not have enough family income, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The pledge of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirtzinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhäuser in Singapore requires an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent that the United overseas bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Paid houses, however, offer the advantage that no review of creditworthiness or income certificates is required here, which is why loans are faster than possible for banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to houses after families feel the pressure due to increasing living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a more relaxed financial policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium incomes visit houses to compensate for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly due to increasing mortgages, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the forefront of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economically, too, because of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
"In the final effect, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards the paving of personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore about 70 percent of the pledged items are gold in the 200 houses of the city state.
People say: "The gold price looks good, let's pledge our grandma's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai pawn house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances the 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors had entered the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that pledge houses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders but also did not directly raise debt.
"Customers will borrow items they already own, and the liquidating of personal assets will not increase budgetary training," she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secure financing.
Nor are all people who use pledges in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something in the short term for a business or an investment, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence discoverer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever more brilliant NSA-speech affair.
In his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, Hans-Christian Ströbele, who was a member of the Green-Bundestag, was concerned about the conditions under which ex-Secretary Staff would declare their statements to a German prosecutor or to an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take 'unfavourable measures' to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has tied up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
Through an additional 2600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments due to grey star, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas I've been concerned with about, and they're the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian Government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would only be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
He thanked the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these elections will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the health spokesperson of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "flaster solution".
"We are therefore in the current situation because the laboratory government has deducted 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government is tearing almost half a billion dollars out of the system and putting the Commonwealth 300 million in and then pretending to be the good news.
Dutton demanded Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package for additional bureaucracy would be spent.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
The story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who plays in France in the 1760s, tells the story of her family being sent to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips off in laziness or sensational lust – and in that lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes him a tormented penitentiary shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there have been serious collisions near one of the sites where probably toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on which
1 November, which the Damascus organization based in The Hague had set up to destroy or make 'inoperable' all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machinery for the mixing of chemicals with toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule aimed at destroying all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in Safira City on Thursday, and experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facility here, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
The activist group, following the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 being government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have links to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fights underline the danger exposed to chemical weapons inspectors, for their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal of weapons is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that it has seen and experienced the destruction of all major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, 'no further inspection activities are planned at present'.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the inspections and had visited 21 out of 23 of the sites designated by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, visiting two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "delivered ... and that the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme had been transferred to other named installations that had been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I prefer the hat of courage and courage shown by you all in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawites, a division of Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger on Judgment for Bomb Army of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had been killed in Bali in 2002 responded annoyed by the sentence for the last of the instigators who were brought to trial, since Umar Patek was to be shot in their opinion.
Patek, who had been on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought after persons of Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing attack.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A culprit was also made in a series of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a masterly bomber, is also called "Demolition Man".
The decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation of Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow the other guys' footsteps.
"One should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have another grandson and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was levelled to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide victim had a rucksack filled with explosives exploded.
After the attack, he fell into the coma for a month and died three times while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
Letting him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
20 years after he has killed 202 people and many hundreds injured is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber to stand in court.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of restoring the connection between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no regret for how much suffering he has done to other people.
The judgment was passed before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have cell phone calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, playing music and using the reputation of movies, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline, explained FAA staff member Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines shall demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of flight staff and the arrangements for the storage of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently have to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You can only start them again after the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives them green light.
On entering the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and they must not start again until the plane has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at take-off, landing and rolling-field, the FAA stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft converted for Wi-Fi use at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like caretakers on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connection to browse, exchange of e-mails, text messages, or download data below three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly, because he refused to turn the device off while the plane was parked on the platform.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic equipment at takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Safety Board, safety expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered as a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts," said Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee, launched by the FAA to examine this issue, recommended last month that the government authorise a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on FAA has increased to relieve restrictions on use.
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget to shut down or ignore the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers in 1966, after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication devices by passenger-led VHF radios, which were the latest technological trend at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than earlier generations of aircraft, but they are also designed in such a way and approved by the FAA that they do not have any electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for a number of years, when the altitude is reached.
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment according to the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally deliver much less radiation than previous generations.
E-Reader, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates for easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Readers invited company employees and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the interference of the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots who spoke for a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the FAA recommended that pilots be allowed to order the off of the equipment by the passengers in the event of an instrument landing under poor visual conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would today be widely equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea-Bohr Island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea-Bohr Island, was released into the wild again.
The water ralle was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was piled up by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the Centre, said: "This water ralle was probably a winter train from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the Bohrinsel.
He added: 'He couldn't fly any more, so we were contacted with the request for help.'
During their release, the water ralle was fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who are responsible for prosperity and work in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, representing around British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU states are stagnating.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favoured by the government instead of stopping with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscene EU institutions.
In their view, on certain legal issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic operators believe that control of these key competences should be recovered after Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as the companies said that the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the most traditional European-friendly.
Finally, and that probably says most, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a significant majority from Britain want a course towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, which is evident among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pressing for a 'sensible change' that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
Much is involved – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiations of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means a greater focus for businesses on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas aria
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Executive Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, will increase the risk of conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "everlasting".
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other neighbouring countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no way passes the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the possibilities for financing are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the European comparison of good economic conditions in the country.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, as German commercial real estate was looking for, the view of the transaction volume is shown.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual offences related to children before 2011 were accused of accusations against the child caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, at the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that it had never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse in the organization.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which an YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography for wrongdoing, and another where a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been sentenced to him for the abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers that he had known about the first case but had not known the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that "there had been external inspections of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as the front line in child safety."
However, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second-lowest assessment of four options in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed 'from me downward' in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety.
Lord had been sentenced to YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two-year activity.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hers argued, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of children's safety.
The staff said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, that she was privately caring for as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for an education on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lords in the YMCA Caringbah, "was very intimidating and most of the time very unattainable".
The managing director said he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord affected their judgment, which is why they did not report to him.
Hare stated that he had informed the Board of Directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the 'Jonathan-Lord-Interfall' was 'not reporting' by employees, and the Board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to force the staff to sign secretarial obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was made by the managing director of the YMCA Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this has been 'overzealous' and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children during the period between 2009 and 2011, when Jonathan Lord was employed there, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, Commission expert on sexual child abuse.
He explained that there had been 'serious problems' in the recruitment, review, preparation, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance of a return as British Prime Minister, but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state Blair has largely avoided expressing himself on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador of the Middle East Peacekeeper quartet.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the equestrian experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to kiss the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was coming.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and has only taken his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee roamed through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap on a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which lie far beyond his age.
And Toffee got top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and since then has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great tension."
They had to step against the entire field of participants and went off the square with goldpokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified, and they all fired and clap him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he has started, it will not take long for him to be on the "pard of the year" look – and I am sure he will cut off well.
A speaker from the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they beat themselves and presented themselves in the presentation ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed their part to that, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be 'reformed' after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of diffamation, was to be reformed on the front page, declared a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based Neue Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribery money to fake reports about a sub-state company.
The new expression will now be subject to a 'extremely corrective', said the regulatory authority.
The “Rectification Order” was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disordered", announced the regulatory authority in a statement.
She said that it had been decided 'to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting license'.
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the correcting of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons at the New Express and to review the management team of the New Express without delay."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and placed himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the state news station CCTV.
I did it first because I was out for money and fame.
I realize I've done wrong.
Following Chen's apologies, the New Express published an excuse on the front page and declared that it had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently filed confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-centimetre measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unmistakably in it, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the Court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession and intentional sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentences between ten years of age and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dehydration channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana residence to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved themselves, the 36-year-old emphasized.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs in a very significant way.
For while vegetarians allow for the consumption of cream towns, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these slumbers are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, next to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but with closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a wide variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealand vegan has been living, and in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I killed my diet and became a vegetarian".
The next step took place around the turn of the century and I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the artificial leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday matters without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says, "but he's the maximum of the Vegans, which extends to the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of mourning burgers, ravines or rubber bears, the Vegan quickly discovered completely new products, and the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "it's actually vegan's not a renunciation, it's not an ascetic, it's an enrichment." The assumption that the diet change reduces the choice of food options, Proctor rather leads back to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditionings also made some still so well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that causes many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor compares.
And turn to: "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also generate the same effect in other ways," explains the Vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages to a barbecue festival.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it is supposed to taste well once in a while.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are best, I'm often checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"As animals are fed with feed instead of grassing on pastures, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 proportion is high in the meat you buy in the cold rest," says Proctor.
There is also the possibility for vegans to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor did not have to go far enough to obtain food.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need is on the spot.
Only occasionally I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but that's what "ordinary" finished products are known to be like."
In any event, the preparation of vegan dishes would have been much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few little tricks you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor could also surprise his in-law parents.
Family celebrations give the Vegan a new sausage.
This has a new meaning when you cook together.
"The situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism was also brought to him.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - You have to act as a vegan with your fingertips on such questions.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to have an enclave date.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan as suspected - and the Vegan doesn't seem as limited in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many done shops offer falafels, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates on pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on it.
"When I started feeding my vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the Mannheim and the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're just the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a sure way to make the most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a little difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives may also be contained in peanuts as colorers, one seems to quickly leave the courage by following ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only that is why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used for food and cleaning.
"Sometimes you develop a scanner look and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it's an important moral sign that hits consciousness.
Perhaps he is not quite able to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The market operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
The trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans at the stock market operator.
Only on Tuesday the indexes of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour for errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two pans in one week alone.
First, the U.S. investment bank had sent Goldman Sachs to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trading in the United States came to an end for several hours due to a computer pan on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In addition, last year the stock exchange of Facebook had provided.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the SEC Stock Exchange Supervisory Board and thundered the company to a record punishment of 10 million dollars.
Konstanz: Radler goes to 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man was on his way to the market on Thursday evening, around 10 a.m., on the left footpath from the station to the market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man walked from a local road, police said the cyclist could not slow down in time.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the course of the course of the course and drew a square wound of about 15 centimetres on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police sends an extradition notice to Assange
The British police today handed over a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been given an "invitation to make himself" that called for him to appear in a police station and added that if he did not comply with this, the arrest threatened him.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden for the charge in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month.
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the USA, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "has sent a 40-year-old man a call to stand at a police station at a time we have chosen," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver who has been rushed between his legs with 210 km/h and a hot drink gets 1,000 pounds of punishment
A car driver was fined £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 near Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Before the Court of Justice of Colchester, Howie was guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay £90 and a 100% victim supplement.
Tax on foreign property owners against London’s speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of treasurer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had a stamp tax of 7 % on apartments costing more than two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which in the 2012/13 tax year amounted to 708 million pounds, totaled revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: 'After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estates are too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete municipal tax system.'
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reticent about the purchase of real estate in London, or stop owners from selling it," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market after price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has become the record value of 11.8 % last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a survey by Savils.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the context of a dog’s tailing with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail were more moving to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known to people that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tailing of their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate divergent other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the dowsing dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog who is racing), then her heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and weaving is more associated with friendly behavior in one direction and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you respond on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behavior and host scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at Bristol University, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether dogs were important to both the left and the right.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was said: “Dogs are more likely to go on a robot dog when their ‘sun’ is rolling to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – just as it is in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore cause the dogs in the various studies to fail to interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys moving performance in Glasgow because of the illness Alex Turners
The Arctic Monkeys rock band has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer is infected with throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be moved.
The announcement of the band came after she had already moved a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"At Alex Turner, a throat inflammation was diagnosed, which is why he unfortunately cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which in the Hydro in Glasgow was moved to 21 November.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences that have arisen.
Please contact the customer service at the sales points where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints first Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed for the first time on February 22nd, new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a Cardinal, who has reached 80 years of age, can no longer take part in the Pope's election – this is true of a group of 120 "elected cardinals".
In a statement in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals will take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as the Consistory.
"Papst Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistorium in February so that other meetings, which require the participation of cardinals from all over the world, can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He declared that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals will be 120 again, and as many cardinals as he wants.
The consistorium next year is therefore significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, says Valero.
At present, there is a certain amount of overhanging on Europe's side, and in particular Italy's.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the creation of the Cardinals' Council, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are commissioned to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was 'good possible' for Francis to ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – that is all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to Cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is calling”.
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors retrieve almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with built-in 2014 to fix a problem with manually adjustable seatrest, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulatory authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seatrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in case of head restraints.
"When the vehicle is driven from behind, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the inmates, so that there is an increased risk of injury", read the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recovered models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not verify the letter of notification due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative effect on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the model year 2014, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM declared on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Desperation of an Obama voters
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been avoided by the blockade tactics of the Republicans.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It's a book that I believed would elevate me during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (Mut to Win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama on the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient writings in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could rob my breath.
The election became an earth slide victory, and news spokespersons kept in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At the time when Obama was in office in 2008, he had approvals of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military deduction from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that party policy blockade tactics have tipped too many efforts to advance our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I finally came up with my explanation attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to be heard by foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished to reveal the state’s misbehavior.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without any procedure, nor why the public funding and expenditure limits are bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the White House to restore the media are the 'aggressive ... since the Nixon government'.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Deputies Office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidate.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unforgettable alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard for so long.
But with the decline of the approval values for Obama on less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become even harder by this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have disintegrated into air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorate after the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters are getting pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a judicial dispute about the payment of 6 million dollars of CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table, whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four Senate votes, which are important for the decision to delete or shorten the CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives a vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, Palmer, with 53 votes in favour, officially declared the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat to be the winner.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it could be done more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where one enters data into a computer, immediately chooses it and then has the result at 6:30 a.m. in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the polls.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Depending on pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office 'very seriously'.
A public office is about serving the public.
"We are not seeking any reward other than history, namely that we can serve in a critical period of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global official investigation of the alleged manipulations on the monetary market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, on which 5.3 billion US dollars a day change the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation, which the scandal is about the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, related persons reported that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from time to time to an earlier dealer to the British supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now expected to have been taken leave from his current position as European head of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was taken leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misbehavior.
The immediate message group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation related persons.
This week, UBS announced that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared Finma that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Justice Ministry and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on monetary market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar persons with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misbehavior.
The news of these investigations has put the dealers in a field of turmoil that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play the affair down, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of internal platforms led to the fact that "one can influence the market with very low ticket prices."
The news came out the same day as Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund office after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the dealer acted alone and that the matter is restricted," said Credit Suisse.
Paint the fence on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Switzerland meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footpath, as stated in a press release.
The planned cover of the destroyed house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the site is threatening to slip.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI had been attached a transparency with the message "We are for it".
However, the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative did not interfere with their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We Are Against Bauruinen".
With this she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the huge project should fail one day.
Talking with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will do better with the realization of the city's project, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they begin to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it is said by the BI.
As it was to be heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he said that he feared the outing for the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the decision of the citizens.
Some seem to be just too scared, others feel that they are "plumping extortion attempt" on the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte für Schiris: Mane no Schwalbenkönig
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category," he took protection from the two offensivewirblers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for mane at 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday, where Senegalese became a alleged activist to the post - which, of course, was none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A sharp misjudgment," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have behaved in every single situation like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," stressed the 46-year-old.
In the face of the success process, however, rangnick voted in favour of a hymn of praise.
"For this there are only two words: really good," he observed.
There's not much to do.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on this way.
There would hardly be any changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Besides a player comes up with the wish that he wants to leave the club," rangnick explained.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The US Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the health law, according to which states would either have to extend the access conditions for Medicaid or otherwise all state Medicaid subsidies would be deleted, was not unlawfully restrictive.
The appeals against the law had been made by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was passed by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low sunfall, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"At last!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swung at the launch ceremony in the TV2 station.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley went straight to the sun’s chairs, while others set up sunglasses for safety reasons.
So far, in winter, sunny hungry people had to drive a cable car to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has been in town since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Veganella for some years.
Post is barely empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for the Sunday emptying are still on different letter boxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in the Jakob Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied.
Whether to be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The social- and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service at datepost.
"Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, these companies are radically and unreasonablely thinned."
Thomas Bittner, President of the Liberals' Group and Urban Association, supports his colleagues in the political groups: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are changed or also deleted secretly."
From a citizen's point of view, the post is miles away.
"At least the letter boxes in the Neuschloß and Rosengarten districts have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying.
Tuberenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration was planning to talk to the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge also has a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
This morning, the magistrate of the city advises on a presentation by transport director Stefan Majer (Green).
This means that parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking watches and ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this "no good idea".
The parking option immediately before the business is "an underestimable advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that after two decades an increase is "overduely appropriate and actually overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions overlap host
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to stand against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The Älbler stood on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
Soon however, it became apparent that they, also due to age, were not able to cope fully with the rapid actions of the joyous cities.
With the hard and placed additions, the Gönningers made themselves extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not in place during the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joyous cities in all interests.
In view of this depressing and playing performance, the third sentence was then won a little bit lazily and without lust at the end of 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, a much more powerful opponent will be standing on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, which was clearly able to prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a tough two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused mistakes and points, especially in ball acceptance; even in passports, the precision was sometimes defective and in some critical game scenes the overeager prevented the look for possible score wins.
In this very well-balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto agreed consistently on the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Caring day at the small English hut
On the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project Ober Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the populace, this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cut free, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the glamour of the canyon, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration could also be taken.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the government presidium Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronship and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide view is to maintain the now highly growing old all-mend field with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and manger, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to art conservation.
Tribukait said that they do not want to fail at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly included in this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the one achieved with the life project and the previous maintenance days for the future.
Following these various statements, District Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, the Forsschlepper may be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Kopfler still single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own urban works can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor has yet reported itself.
As the only candidate for the succession of the no longer candidate mayor Norbert Brugger, the 46-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Köppler from Löffingen has so far been established.
The application deadline expires on Monday, 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which had thousands of earlier Nortel patents, imposed on Thursday an avalanche of complaints against patent infringements against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was oversaw when Nortel sold the company.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents relate to technology that brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, according to the suit that thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and offered last $4.4 billion.
After it was oversaw the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the patent of action at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the letter of appeal.
Rockstar claims a high amount of damages from Google, since it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt honours first freely elected President
Mohammed Mursi takes office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was the first freely elected president of the country and thus took on the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black robed judges of the court, who had his seat on the Nile and was imitated by an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which, since its founding 84 years ago, had been strongly taken into the vision of the respective government as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11:00 local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer the new President, and unlike the presidial prunk from Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the car convoy could cross the normally lively road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As the uncharismatic "replace wheel" of the Brotherhood mocked his personal prestige since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for the Islamists but all those who wanted to bring the uprisings of the 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, explained to the judges in the wooden panel in which he held office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his starting address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel who played the national anthem he was listening to in the obituary.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's largest hearing room with speech choirs by "The army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, which was established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and he promised to demand back presidial powers which the military council had taken over from the head of state who had been expelled from office.
But by putting off the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis' speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called "Pump This Party", on Saturday evening we will continue with an Ü 25-party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are naturally promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers Crashed by Head: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder in exchange for a defective outside sensor and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater on the outside facade of a guest house.
As he climbed the ladder leaned on the roof, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg.
Rapist in South Africa: Lifelong Detention
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice a lifetime on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC station.
The victim was later killed by the consequences of serious injuries.
John Kana had been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused horrors throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of young people was so horrendous that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to be in a bar with Booysen during the trial night.
He also admitted to have beaten and raped her, but he argued to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police first assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost commonplace in South Africa: there are about 64 000 ads each year for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa value the dark figures in sexual violence on the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": The Pro7 star Bonndorf visited for the TV broadcast "Galileo".
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pig cows, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli as the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest explains the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's dearest ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and Kittel he comes into the factory.
Also, Jumbo must first disinfect his hands before he is allowed to grab the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening in Waldshut with fast snacks
"I'm working huge quantities here," the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product marvel.
16,000 Colognes a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you're measuring Roberto Blanco, what happens," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's worth watching.
The viewer sees that cutting the Cologne is still manual.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditional without finding bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoke-fire remind Jumbo visually of a "sub-boat".
The trick: pine branches in the smoke ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumpbo," he announces the test feed.
"This is really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the 2011/12 period.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start into the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on the right track towards record year revenue before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest winners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which offsets a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while business customers were also less spending here.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a profit is expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars yesterday.
Schools are held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes 'unseen texts' to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE language examination, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curriculums for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other key subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less price work.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence", while stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stringent".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, from coalition circles it is likely that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in ranking lists – will encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and tasty cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colorings presents the circular performance show at the Bürgerhaus this weekend.
The reviews were carried out on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 will host this large exhibition.
Breeders of the associations in Soest County show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges made the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
The visitors to the show are well informed as the evaluation of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition is held on Saturday at 2.30 p.m. by Mayor Hermann Arndt.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a Tombola and a deliciously equipped cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde locks and acts with a new bubhead for the first time.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To hell with hell - Theological reflections on how to deal with the last things today".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to consider in the forum how people today measure the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had put it on those images of heaven and hell, "who still shape our ideas today", the contemporary prophetic doctrine shows themselves rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness from the hopes of completion.
"The greater hope has been properly evicted by the criticism of religion by Christians," says the speaker.
She "has provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come to us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the nuisance of death".
This involves the question of that longing, "which dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms University in West Germany.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirmed their creed at the firming
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Soul Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been formed.
The morning service was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Deakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the firms had prepared themselves for the great holiday.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmenseee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to handle the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel of the eventing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants were, especially at the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 metres of altitude, also numerous everyone who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two German top-class junior riders were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came up with the recommendation of good rankings at the German Championships.
These two could probably be removed from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small amount of time to the goal and defend his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was once again able to place himself in second place.
In the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the Albtraum team who made it to the top of the winning event.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie from Owingen came in second and third place.
A gratifying development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance was the whole range of athletes represented.
The age structure ranged from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were still more absolute topathletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to disembark themselves from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-profi by the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Together with a team colleague, Pangerl was already world champion in twelve hours driving.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With it Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German champions his own in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 metres of altitude, the three-seen hall was finished in the finish.
Pangerl was the first to race over the finish line.
Only one second behind that, the Routinier Ballerstedt won second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as a third party of the overall score.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen won second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers showed themselves very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then a inflammation developed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you can't be the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
Cameroon has only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Camerooners could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and travel on the roof via unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bwelling – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team will begin to investigate hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip", says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and this on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
Operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator, thus working wells and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They're drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will go back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work, it makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a performance break he had received now enabled him to work again.
"That's changing the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest stem from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteers in Bwelles Group.
He's always either in the hospital or he's trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be at operations where we help to remove blood or think the instruments are for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated health care materials.
But if they are in Yaoundé first, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He's no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonic people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfill a promise he has given to his father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, the acting art.
The old man Santiago can't imagine anything when fishing.
That's just how the two of them complement themselves.
It is almost impossible to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man the fisherman Manolo speaks of.
If Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, that's true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his will.
Janson is on stage as an alone actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologue is not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise's favour, which sings the feeling of life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descending to the Romans
A waste water channel from the Roman period is preserved at about 120 metres in length below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne don't pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two delicate church towers realize that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city's fathers wanted to have a car-friendly city, so the remains of the old city walls remained only what was not too big.
Most of the parking lot users are therefore also passing the Roman remains today and just drop off their car.
But if you look more closely, you will find in Parkdeck D2 an archaeological site separated by metal bars.
It can be seen about five meters high ruins of hand plate-sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
Next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants climb back down to the depth.
Here we experience the headquarters of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman Right and City of Agrippinenses, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the presbyterium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel, which is preserved here at about 120 meters length.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want", Schulze cheers the guests up.
There's still a surprise to Schulze.
After getting the key at the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall for which construction work will soon begin.
Until completion, however, a few more years will pass.
Bean almost hacked off: reprint of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocking environment is being rolled up after more than four years.
A trial of attempted fatalities, dangerous body injury and damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
He is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants are silent to the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and were then part of the bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutor's office, together with unknown compliments in Finowfurt, accused them of suffocating and beating three men in a car.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have been part of the competing group of Hells Angels.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It seems that a chase with several cars had gone ahead.
According to charges, it was about district struggles and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A judge said at the time that it could not have been proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the judgment after revision of the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the Landgericht for further proceedings.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
The main focus was on the reconstruction of the procedures during the night of the day.
As a witness, the commissioner, then investigating, was invited.
In the center were cell phone calls from the defendants and other persons who had been heard by the police.
It's difficult that Rocker almost always adheres to a law they prefer - and don't say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Procurator Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said that new traces have appeared since the last trial.
There are eleven further negotiating days for the process.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood good, but someday it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat the hunger is felt.
Sure, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for that!
What's closer than going chilly to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little thing?
I admit, I'd like to join you if it's going to be fast food late at night or early in the morning.
A few pommes, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like off home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangs make themselves felt.
Because what does one have to miss is that with constant regularity one throws his fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends there are discarded paper bags on road edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I asked myself.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home respectfully to the next trash bin?
It's not just that paperware is ruining the landscape.
Tüten have also covered transport facilities such as control boards and caused accidents.
But what "return society" is thinking about, it probably does not even know what that word means.
When you travel more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after a celebrated night: clothes, bottles and other garbage are storming.
There would be more or less of a bag, as opposed to the street where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I already see the day when the cities and communities will have to clear the way - and the fast food chains for their bags will have to demand a fee.
Obama's Retirement in Health Policy
After severe criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his often repeated, clear promise: 'If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.'
After hundreds of thousands have received a letter of termination from their insurer, the Republicans have accused the president of having deceived the American public in recent days.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of the citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on terminations, Obama invited those Americans who received such communications to look back on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They're getting a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have themselves completed insurance would have to look after another tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Washington House of Representatives.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement of an educated Sebelius to an advisor sitting behind her at the hearing held yesterday at the House of Representatives was taken up after a discussion with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri. It was a question of whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly insisted on the question of why the "architectin" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced a state-funded insurance in order to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an aircraft base in the Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
According to CNN, the aim was to "have been missiles and associated equipment", of which the Israeli government feared that they were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab station Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia on which Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not safe.
A speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said: "We do not comment on these reports".
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successful, to deliver soil-air missiles to the Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hizbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, states that the US espionage had "been too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, suggested a evasion of the United States' defensive attitude towards their surveillance programmes by saying that in certain cases the spy "was too far too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that together with Barack Obama, he was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about NSA's spy activities.
Due to the informed information, the U.S. government has become a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the part of its allies.
In a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of a number of things that have been done by car pilot, simply because the ability to do so dates back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to the 11th of September."
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to agree that US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a power of good and that many lives had been saved through its monitoring operations.
He added: "We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is obsessed with killing people, blowing up the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats of not taking part in anti-terrorism organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," explained Murphy, who is a democrat in the Senate for the first time and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on External Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service stated this week that the reports were irrelevant and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared this to be common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the journey of Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some 'serious words'.
He said that European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have used for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be based on the fact that we are not the only ones to spy," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller's use in the Bundesliga external play of the FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz is about to use Nicolai Müller.
He'll try to train with the team tomorrow.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his application in the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
The Mainzers already have to give up on the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the judgment and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after stating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she agreed to have the story figured out.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the edge of Phukets instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga, who has turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is free against a security deposit of 50,000 Baht.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
From the court it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its affected tourist image, and this is why it comes to an acquittal.
