Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helper infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Lower Bavaria's mammy, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positively for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further spread, we unfortunately need to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Before, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that cultivates strawberries, cucumbers, coal and red beet - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with well 3300 inhabitants close to Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to preserve peace: "Our information is a closed group of people".
In the courtyard, infected workers were separated from non-infected workers, the site is now surrounded by a fence of barriers.
Greens and SPDs shared responsibility with the state government.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitter if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns need to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the Parliamentary Managing Director of the Greens.
This is quite similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the housing conditions need to be carefully monitored.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".

Report: Seehofer insists on longer data storage
Stock data storage is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year.
As reported in the "Image on Sunday", Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change of law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He felt it would be useful to "make urgent adjustments to the law already now", the paper quotes from the letter.
At present, data storage of stocks is exposed.
A decision by the ECJ is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wants to make the amendments before, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, continues in the report.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it was only useful to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already declared itself in June for a storage of data.
NBA: Strip club anger for Clippers star Lou Williams
Exciting the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he visited the comic club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who should have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year "Sweet Lou", as it is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for precisely these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Ant. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that NBA Williams ordered a ten-day quarantine.
This way, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale that starts at night on Friday.
Söder expresses itself after mass infection to the Corona site
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a teasing for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be on our homepage live.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has appalled authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working, more than a third of them have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the area, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the well over 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes so far that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Bisse of conscience": confession of the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the acts very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "patched by conscience and taken very much by the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, the man, according to the prosecutor's office, threatens ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect now detained had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eye of the investigators.
discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended to consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of the "picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to get dangerous Bayern and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this Phalanx."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European single market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to achieve more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and passed it on to the press instead of addressing it," Grindel said about accepting a expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has been very busy with me human beings."
The gift worth about 11,000 euros he had received from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have handled completely transparent and unruly.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a flour out of the gift", the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naïve, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Investigations have been made.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the masses and program highlights like Saale burn, Rakoczy ball or arrest, many of the corona-compliant alternative programs were at their expense.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurdirector Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the feast.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So did this time in the Corona year.
The couple made it comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watched the historians flirting and listened to Cuban live music at the playbench restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," Konhäuser says.
They don't miss the masses of people that belong to Rakoczy.
But for this you lack the usual program highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic fortress and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament is to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the arrest in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"That's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even though individual riders were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrilles will take place again in the coming year," says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 a Rakoczy-reit-tournament should take place again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second-ligist Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second-ligist CF Fuenlabrada has been sleeping more and more deeply in the crisis due to a corona outbreak.

Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, five or six other members of the corona test had been positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the appeal, said Tebas Llanos.

Argentina rejects counter-offer of creditors
The new claims could not be met, reported the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"During 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina is calling on its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state pleite.
It would be the ninth payment failure in Argentine history.
Finally, the lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is committed to its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power to be around 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle interest payments of $503 million, resulting in a limited payment failure.
Professionally Arrived - Private Not Yet
"It's going great" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notarial unit.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the Ph.D. took up the work, and normal daily business has long been on full tour.
"But I still have to arrive in private," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time had not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
At present, she is with her husband, who is a judge in the local court in Regensburg, in search of a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband had been able to apply for a short term parental leave in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she at one time also has an overnight opportunity with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring country circle, of course, the city of Eggenfelden has been a term for a long time.
During visits with her family in the last few months, she has found: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the free space.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home country of Niederbayern also plays a central role: After the Jura-Studium in Passau she gave her referendum time and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a Notara processor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu as well as Regensburg - at that time she also studied "nearly" the promotion in Arbeitsrecht - she took up her first position as a Notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went to the parental age, after which she moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has been in charge of representation services in various notarial departments.
When the position in Eggenfelden had been exonerated for Lutz Feller's near retirement, she had seen the right time for full professional return, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of their predecessors, who will take over the holiday office at the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the firm's team: "It's going great!"
It makes it easier for her to rely on recorded processes to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten- respectful cribs she has already contacted a local institution.
And everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging lines of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be filled even to 20 percent at the start of the season in case of a fan return.
"As a result of the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are planning, according to current status, with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer, "the Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city at Bundesliga games takes a little more than 81,000 spectators.
In last season's ghost games caused by the Corona Pandemic, about four million euros had been lost to the BVB per game.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalization at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the regular audiences, some of the around 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accounter when these revenues break away completely."
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all are currently "goodly advised to take a stable side length".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short work in Germany alone, then the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer explained.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB professional for their salary-partly abandonment, which is intended to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their pay-off has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short work."
Tiny Miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 early children who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lung, nor intestine, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothing and mini-windels specially made for them.
But not so small that they are not in the mood - "and like," says Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "The home dress" - by video.
After that, the students could exchange the piece and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enriching of the class.
Although everyone at the end agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional charms, the theatre also shows the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game business," said Director Winfried Tobias.
First round: The TSV 1860 would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet in the first round for Eintracht Frankfurt.
This was the result of the resolution on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponent in the first round of the DFB Cup is set.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt with a successful qualification.
This resulted in the release on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the corona panel is not yet complete, placeholders were used for the release.
Due to the voluntary abandonment of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the finale of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should Zweitliga climber Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesingers had to win the final game against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the third league start.

De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the south-state essay "From the Winds" (1939).

Eight films shot her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
She was also given much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dark Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel" in 1952.
The piece has been a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied für einem Leiche".
From marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage, too, was broken.
However, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
The World Cup's second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they held their national team-college Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
In September last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final match at the Rhine, their Bewinger Ehlers/Flüggen versus the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde cast a defeat with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand in early September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured their tickets.
Kalbitz noise from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fine leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had largely decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really were to remove right-wing extremists consistently from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been excluded for a long time," said Strasser.
"For this there is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is left out now does not say anything and does not change anything," he said to the "world on Sunday".
"It speaks, rather, volumes, how many Frenetic supporters still have a right-wing extremity in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again be less than five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "wings" around Thüringer AfD's head of state and political group Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection considers the strone to be "secured right-wing extremist aspirations".
In May, the AfD board of directors threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership of the now prohibited right-wing "home-faith German Youth" (HDJ) and the Republicans at the time of his party entry.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing group in Brandenburg's Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The Wolf ate only cream.
The AfD remains a right-wing extreme party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
One wants to escape further observation through the protection of the Constitution and try to get under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't let go the spirits she called.
There's nothing going on yet," said Brandenburg's SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn, commenting on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD Landesverband and the political group continued to be their right leader to this day."
The legal debate on Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, he announced that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid.
This is more than 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to the mainland and the transmission by the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have fed a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind current from the North and the Baltic Sea thus reaches 13,73 TWh, compared with 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is in addition to wind conditions resulting from higher production capacity, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running full at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjörgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
This year's record day is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms produced more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea windwheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
Thus, nearly seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold at the Galerie des Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold spread the usual framework after the Corona-Pause.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent provided the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
The "Sandtogether" association was engaged to the north of the gallery.
Freital: Windbergfest for Corona cancelled
The Windbergfest is not taking place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have truly not made this decision easy and - knowing how difficult it is for those involved - hoped for until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Partless).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had been flown to the ground and into the tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a follow-up to contact could not have been observed in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by a multiple number.
Rumberg comforted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, including the Winter Mountain Festival from 7th to 9th May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10th to 12th September 2021.
Dressage Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories on the weekend at four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix for the opening of consecration gold and Quantaz, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and in the course.
At the 15-year-old mare of Weihegold, Werth made a clear stand against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday.
On Saturday, the Germans were also clearly on Quantaz before her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first cure at all.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
Future air traffic controllers in Worms
The Wormser Hochschule continues in the air: the "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is funding a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of the study not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are used evenly both in the university and at the DFS Air Safety Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of professorship.
represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training for air traffic piloting at Worms University.
Nine students started this year.
So far, the DFS experiences are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS during the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, Stiftung Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, multi-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The Stiftung Professorship is an important bridge between science and business.
With it we would like to join the already existing cooperation with DFS German Aviation Management as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for the Worm University to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air transport.
In the use of the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first Stiftung professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasises: "The Worms University has a single position feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopters land on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully locked on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in operation.
A 76-year-old went straight on a Ford at about 12.40 am in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the guiding board.
The front airbags were triggered by the impact, while the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient then flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed off.
Heil wants to test other sectors according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis again revealed the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Law-enhancement is underway.
But are they right - and will it stay?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors, in accordance with the strict regulations now planned against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at our industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer has already warned against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak in the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet will decide on this Wednesday a law of salvation.
In the case of slaughter, decomposition and meat processing, large-scale establishments should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited.
Employers' President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and workers' leave if one does not want to completely stifle the economy."
For example, for large areas of trade, construction and plant engineering, works contracts are necessarily the basis for their value added by the customer.
"The errors of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts would be useful.
"If an industrial company instructs a craftsman to install a safety plant, this is a normal factory contract."
The German meat industry considers that a ban on works contracts and rental work is unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why, in the future, the portioning and packaging of cheese should be subject to different labour law from that of sausages, it is stated in an opinion on the bill project, as reported by the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
Thus, a ban would increase consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European workers from industrial contract companies worked in the industry according to the results of an examination of the NRW Labour Protection Administration, part 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wage was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the housing of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, through "trick-rich constructions" they had been bypassed.
"Now we need to be thoroughly cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt at the end of July in the Cabinet, measures not only concern the meat sector - for example higher testing rates in the field of employment protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
This draft includes amendments to the Law on the Enforcement of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonmacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to make even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, anything possible, for example animal transports," said Nonmacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg Aktuelle".
However, more staff posts are needed for more controls.
Three dead at crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
In the event of a crash of an ultralight aircraft to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people were reported to have died.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people had been saved in the event of the accident, said a spokesman at the Wesel County Agency.
A parachute had been found at the accident site, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported with reference to eyewitnesses that before the crash the plane had come together with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Raumung von Frankfurter Opernplatz peacefully proceeds
A week after the outpourings in Frankfurt, the opening of the Opera Square in the night on Sunday also took place peacefully.
In the end, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left him at 1 o'clock before the beginning of the break.
The police had been in service with numerous officials since the early evening, and there was a larger police call throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend from midnight there was a ban on the meeting for the opera field, on which a week ago it had come into confluences.
Police had been attacked from the crowd of celebrations with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police records, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car passes: Young woman in case of accident on federal road 83 at Hofgeismar seriously injured
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at about 13.25 a.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imagers, the fire brigade sought out possible fellow drivers.
According to the police, the woman was on the road 83 in the direction of her place of residence Humme, when her car came off the road from previously unexplained cause and overrun several times.
The fire brigade had to cut free the roof of the car to save the victims.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched by the swivel ladder with a thermal image camera.
The drone season from Warburg, which also works with thermal imagers, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces found no one between the high corn plants.
The serious injury was brought to the Kasselsklinikum with the truck for further supply.
Nearly 50 forces of the fire brigade Hofgeismar, Humme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a ransoming goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five times world football player made the 36th Skudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 a.m.
With 83 points Turin, which without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira did not drive two days before the end of the season of the series A from one place.
The table width Inter Milan is seven points below.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half of the time, then Ronaldo hit after a release variant with the last action.
A play by Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the prison room border directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0 against the now more open guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the smooth but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, the foulphmeter shot to the latte should only have etched Ronaldo himself with a view to the Torjäger rating.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically on a ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said Trainer Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of its players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve had the ultimate advantage at the top of the table due to the weakness of the competitors.
For in the eleven games before the game on Sunday the Sarri team had only five victories.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo is also going to be a goalkeeper.
As the Portuguese superstar has achieved 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immolle has already 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the winning of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015/2016 season, the Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August, the "Alte Dame" of Italian football is waiting for the next chance of title.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but on 7 August he has to compete against Olympique Lyon for a 0:1 match to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court judgments, motorists continue to gas on the Baden-Württemberg roads in countless illegal races: last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the south-west have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for the years before, but the lawns are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigation proceedings were conducted in the public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, one year later it was already 252 and in the current year by early June 151.
The race was less about organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior replied to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers would have been spontaneously opposed to each other or they would have taken the flight from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
At the tax, mainly German men aged 18 to 60 were sitting.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the lawns caught and also asked to cash out: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been imposed.
There was no evidence, however, that the number of illegal car races actually rose.
Rather, because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years, other drivers responded more sensitively than before and showed more frequently, said a minister.
Especially popular with Rasern is the motorway 8. Again and again drivers stop the traffic there to get space and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months before they were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular racetrack
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other Bundesautobahn.
With a tempo limit, we try to slow down the lawns on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the Geisingen.
Most of the high-priced, high-priced sports and luxury bodies often have Swiss markings, because the riders avoid to lawn for Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the tempo limit should not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general tempo limit of 130 kilometres, we would be able to address this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic experts of the SPD Landtagsfraktion.
"The brake threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you were not to be legally on the road here and there at 200 kilometres and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Whoever is in such a way beyond all the rules and not only puts his own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
On the other hand, this is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred from the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harder controls on the routes concerned.
Not uncommonly, the high-tourage mass has become more painful and more serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people throughout the country have died in the race, two of them unparticipants in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men are expected to have delivered a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, punched against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured during the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, more severe penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action to increase the level of sanctions on illegal motor races is not seen", says the Ministry of the Interior's paper.
Blue light from July 23th: Thirsty breakers steal drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard around 3.40 a.m. noises in the valley road and ran toward the snack.
There he noticed a man who was serving on the fridge with drinks and left the snack by a previously punched entrance door.
The perpetrator fled toward the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also served at a cash desk and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hood powder, black pants and bright shoes.
The police accept further evidence.
Ackermann sprints for victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer of the Bora-hansgrohe team was on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in mass sprint, after already winning a stage on Saturday.
The season was three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger succeeded.
On the morning the 26-year-old had decided for himself the mountain time trial, thus taking over the top in the classification.
Only 104 riders had finished in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain season.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a victory," said Ackermann after his success on Saturday.
"The Sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the World Federation UCI, a corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Visitors at the start and target were not allowed.
Head Office gave instructions for lay animation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) was suddenly in the water by swimming lifeless.
According to fire brigade, the emergency call came shortly before 1 p.m.
"A control station disponent immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," said a fire official to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the resurgence measures a little later.
The child at risk of life was transported to the university clinic under resuscitation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely took up the accident investigation.
The fireman: "We expect a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorised Tuning Meeting - Police intervenes, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily more than 1000 people took part in a "Tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
A big Tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberger Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Middle Franconia police, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstadter Straße had been detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 22.30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a variety of vehicle controls there.
Only recently the police had announced that they wanted to act more strongly against so-called car posers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted well 700 vehicles and around 1100 people, accounting for the police.
However, only a small part of those present in the "Autoposer" and the Tuning scene should be assigned to this.
Apparently most of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it is assumed that this was mainly a showy one.
In addition, the majority of those present in the current anti-infection provisions, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and the wearing of a oral-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on-the-spot were completed by 9 a.m.
A total of 10 vehicle officials found such structural changes that the operating permit had been exhausted.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
Illegal car races didn't exist.
"The police presidium will continue to keep in mind the events and continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the rise of those who are oblivious," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the participating towing company: "They have all the beautiful rims that we must not scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Even because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause any damage.
"After all, the young people are supposed to get their cars back unharmed."
Figures of the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of short-term abuse
Berlin - The Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) according to its own statement, approximately 900 suspect cases are based on abuse of short-term workers' money.
"This is extremely little for more than 88,000 companies that have announced short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Executive Board responsible for the operational business, of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis a lot of companies suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to react quickly.
The test normally lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more precisely, we'll look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there's going to be some more.
We are not naïve and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
The BA also uses analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible insolvency issue in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvency than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are prepared for the case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of claims for insolvency funds."
Still the numbers are inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Stiftung Prussian Schlösser und Garten (SPSG), the Foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played Rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by revierdrivers, said SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Foundation's parks, there are accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 transit regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June, a celebration of about 300 people was held in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness is broken.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to park regulations, there are few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal Techno party during the night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the Land authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were outstanding in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young practitioners are in tourism establishments, but at least one holiday visitor has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were invited to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evenings.
The delay time was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wier, the dpa.
Also, single guests should travel early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights of accommodation last year.
In a normal season about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of practitioners who had celebrated and could have infected in several localities.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he said to the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15th were contacted.
The outbreak arouses memories of the Austrian ski and party town of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of the Corona spread throughout Europe at the beginning of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus in the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football recordmaster Manchester United returns to the Champions League after one year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the last match day of the Premier League by a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be satisfied with the Europa League, because the FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as fourth for the king class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa rejoiced.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a Red Card for Leicester City in the post-playing period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to a close.
Chelsea, in the Champions-League-Achtelfinal opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach also stands in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who went past the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided with the Watford and the AFC Bournemouth team, but had to shake around the class for a long time at West Ham United.
The late tour of Jack Grealish (84.) was immediately similar to Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which took three trainers in the season, drops after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at the FC Everton.
In the end, there was a point missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the score record in English football.
Manchester City holds the best brand with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütte van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
At the end of the season, the Prime Minister-League boss is also expected to be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, the football business in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even an early demolition or a performance of the remaining games was discussed on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be finished without special occurrences - however, as in Germany without viewers in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against head of government Netanyaus are becoming more and more violent.
There has been violent conflicts at night.
The Israeli police took violent action in the night of Sunday in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participating in unrest, reported police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld.
The police used waterthrowers, among other things, to disband the rally.
Overall, according to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's headquarters.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyaus dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns, and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in an area demonstration that supported Netanjahu also reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested by police near Tel Aviv because it is suspected to have sprayed from a driving car pepper spray on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a trade fair attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The Demonstrant was easily injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallys accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently Netanjahu was criticized for handling the corona crisis.
Among other things, it will be provided with rapid easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has been hard on the economy of the country.
The unemployment rate was at the last rate of more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Coronavirus in Israel last rose to ever new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - On Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen, an accident caused nine minor injuries.
A driver was on the road with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "It was thought she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn away."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He pushed the car in the back.
Three passengers in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured during the accident.
Several ambulances took them to an surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks out Border Town after Corona suspicion
North Korea has so far seen in its own measures to ward off the corona virus a "lighting success".
Now the country reports on a suspicion case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, for fear of a disaster, North Korea has completely sealed a big city.
Despite the most severe epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong the emergency situation had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspicion be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-Cov-2 in the shot country.
To date, North Korea has not registered any infection and described its defenses as "light success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of illness were found in a "outlier" who had illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
For the cross-border crossing within the four-kilometre wide and largely still represented military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military admitted the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Some people were under investigation.
According to North Korea, on Saturday, due to the suspicion that a meeting of the Labour Party's political bureau, chaired by powerman Kim Jong Un, was convened.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The party's central military commission is therefore intended to investigate the "outfall" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Stress in front of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still under discussion before great summer break
"Besides environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the construction plan for the large-scale urban development-east project," says it rather occasionally in the middle of the urban press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 a.m. in the Great Hall of Congress Center Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is, however, discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of these are scarce, most recently in individual committees even refusing to do so.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which has come out of citizenship and then developed by the administrative and municipal council not to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "anticipated", "spection", "spection", "disfellowshipping" and "conscious false statements".
"All mean to know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim population list for a year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city that the Technical Town Hall is contrary to the statements of the city administration after grants, whose existence is small, to clean up for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently from the city hall and from the proponents of the economy.
To shape the city by its own strength and not an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the castle, the rental of the ex-thale for administrative areas and a more small part of the city centre transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role in particular.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population against health noise caused by road transport, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of having to do so because, by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned speeds and due to little commitment to cycling, they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, says the VCD.
The municipal council is also voting on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Furthermore, the agenda for accession to the Baden-Württemberg climate protection pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but need to take corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season with much delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with almost half a year delay.
Before the league of the supersport cars can take up the regular operation, the first test rides were started.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking up his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go in the curves differently.
But it really has been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motorsports, but every new series also brings new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves dazzling and we have also made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also have its first race.
As of 31 July, the 33 supersport cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest in Motodrome.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The lausit ring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be quick."
How fast Zimmermann really is, that turns out in two weeks.
"The teams of course play poker in the tests a little," he says.
"But finally we are very satisfied and looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pressed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
Currently it is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-formel-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will hit the GT-Lenkrad.
British transport minister of quarantine decision caught cold
The British Government's decision to quarantify Spain's vacationers for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, has caught the Minister of Transport of the country cold.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided on the measure.
Due to the rise in the number of coronas in Spain, London's Cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that also Shapps will have to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are only on the day of holiday, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed for holidaymakers in Spain," said Labour Member Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to say Grant Shapp's word."
Nearly one month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict starting block, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists, in particular, make nightlife responsible for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the British.
The British Government is currently dissuading from unnecessarily travelling to the mainland of Spain, which is the most popular Canarys and Balearic Islands in British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the Navy in his country an equipment of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, said Putin on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Marine Paradise.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also informed the Interfax agency about successful tests of the naval hypersonic rocket zircon.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are regarded as weapons of the future.
Underwatertropedeo is being built
It was also built on the atomicly fitable underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was called.
The planned Seedrone is planned for the destruction of coastal targets.
The president, who was also carrying a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be employed by the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Russian Navy has protected Russia reliably, said Putin on the day celebrated by sailors throughout the country.
In many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces began the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia was fighting alongside forcesman Baschar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
It was also fired there.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defence, not only were warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona is difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit the ground in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and severe rainfalls now threatened parts of the U.S. state, reported the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Agency NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called for an emergency for many districts.
The work of the helpers in Texas-grassing Corona-Pandemy continued to be difficult, according to US media.
Evacuated for Caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
With regard to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and becomes even more intense, considering that it is sweeping through an area most affected by Covid-19 in the state".
According to Johns Hopkins University, approximately 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona Pandemic.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
You should not disregard practices that we've used to, like wearing masks, according to the CBS station, the governor said.
It was important that all the distances were kept.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency accommodation should be tested on Corona.
At first, damage had only been reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Removed
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island directly off the Texan coast, according to the authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level hurricane.
For the part of Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior of the country and taxed to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglass" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on the way to Hawaii on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the Hurricane Centre expected it to weaken further.
According to the prediction, on Sunday (local time) he is supposed to be near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Above the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year after a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected to become very strong vortex storms, the Authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year above the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which was an under-average even at 10 percent, at that time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was watching the storms closely and was in contact with the affected states.
Four Gates Recognized: Video Assistant "Punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuric was recognized by two goals
Naples - Four goals achieved, four goals recognized: Sassuolo Calcio experienced at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league series A a raben-black evening - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so hard on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had been guided by a gate by foreign defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in which 32nd minute Filip Djuric rejoiced at first the compensation.
The Video Assistant Referenceee (VAR) took the hit back due to a remote position.
Five minutes later, Djuric shot the ball again in the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of Angriff Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also reduced by the referee team as indicated by the VAR.
In the following season, Allan made the 2 to 0 final stand for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern München: Pavard hurts
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can convert his successful defense after World Champion Benjamin Pavard's injury.
The Frenchman, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Chief of the Middle Field Joshua Kimmich, who has had the third most use-minutes, suffered a band violation at the left foot and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich face-to-face weather, the right-wing defender broke down a training game and was driven out of the course with a golf cart.
How long the unlimited regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An engagement in the eighth final game against the Chelsea FC on August 8 is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament that will begin in Lisbon on August 12.
However, the Bayern do not want to be stopped by the failure of the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick called the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show his victorious title collectors in the 28 days to the Royal Class End Game on August 23.
"We have simply mastered the duties with championship and cup excellent.
Now it is important to create the special yet," Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve in a concrete way, the eight-final duty against the Chelsea FC is to be met.
After the 3–0 game in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the local arena should not become a Bayern nightmare again as in the lost "Final dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust with a good game," Flick demanded.
A vote test is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had been on holiday for 13 days after the double, on a one-time August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players for Edel-Shopping Leroy Sané, who for the first time after his change from Manchester City met all new colleagues on the square.
"Leroy has been well integrated like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to train, Flick would rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team is now trained in strength for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter finale against the Barcelona and Lionel Messi FCs, with real Madrid, Manchester City, and Juventus Turin possible opponents in the semifinals.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not quite as easy," the chief coach, who can rely from Tuesday on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The World Championship Recorder Klose and Flick know of some of the common tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 vote.
With his current team the work was "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winnings" is an imposing feature of his team.
The tournament with Neuner teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of them were involved, including Thiago and David Alaba, who is also a volunteer and defender, whose stay is not guaranteed beyond the king-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to cut their world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
However, all America races have been cancelled.
Racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more racetracks were added to the ten previously confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, it will be driven at the Nürburgring in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimão.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting for WM points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This includes 13 races at current level at the 2020 racing calendar.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1-Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be completed in the king's class of motorsports during this exceptional season.
The Formula 1 season is due to end in Asia.
The final racing calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, there could still be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November before the officially polled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Rules of Procedure require races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 rules require at least three continents to be awarded the World Cup.
Even if, as is currently planned, only two continents are driven, there is to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the title with reference to "exceptional circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the ongoing corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Reject meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again in the next season," Carey said.
The rejection of America's races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the area of São Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a rejection.
We are prepared to take the necessary safety measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
In the famous Latight show by Stephen Colbert, Greta Thunberg was a guest by video, and revealed in the interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Klimatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular U.S. latenight show via video.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the last two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been drawing attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now, in a well-known Latight show, she talked about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Lattight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes to the street" she experienced.
Head of state and leading politicians who make fun of them in social media or even try to silence them, she finds them "loving", as she sees the reactions "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she followed a bitter look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured from the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
She replied briefly to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question: "To be honest, I don't think it needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably didn't expect the ready-to-use answer and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobilie with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immofe is now in the race for Europe's Golden Shoes in the same way as Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immole continues to have the best chance to become a goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
At 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, the former BVB-Profi contributed three hits, including two elf meters in both halfs.
The 30-year-old now has 34 season goals on his account from the fourth season of the table, and Robert Lewandowski of the FC Bayern Munich has the same number in the run-down Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steep downhill and then slowly up again.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genuine guitarist, drug junkie, cult adherent: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, and on Saturday, members of the family informed in an official opinion that a further opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all the former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the long-standing legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamed instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their biggest successes but then without him.
There should have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970 three years after it was founded.
It followed a social descent.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in the psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture area.
He is said to have lived on the street for some time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
Already in his early years, he was enthusiastic about US blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professional guitar and was given the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage five years later.
Shortly later, he was hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the summer of 1967.
In the winter of 1968/69, the group gave the song "Albatross" the first number one hit and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the quick climb soon showed its shadows: Green did not handle the media rumour, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
At the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swims on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not succeed in making a bigger comeback until he re-started with a group of friends of musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returning to earth.
Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group free of drugs until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend at his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
