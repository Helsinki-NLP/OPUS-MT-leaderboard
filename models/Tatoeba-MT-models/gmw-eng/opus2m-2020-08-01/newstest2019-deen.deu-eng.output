DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on the fact that one comes into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt it as it was in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "phrasing mowers" of the "picture newspaper".
Despite the months of debate about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be so until some point," said Grindel.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, and he also had reason to reason that Grindel had not defended him against racist animosities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "one leaves a team or changes a club, one talks with his coach about it and I am sorry that this conversation has not been achieved so far".
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartenhörde burned
At 2:13 p.m., Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade went out and found the cabin in full fire at the time of arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and firestower cleared to the essential extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had infected a battery for the store at lunchtime.
That might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire is still to be determined - as is the cause of the fire.
However, he may be considerable, for the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Becomings: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Street
What just driven Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Looded") himself had a live chat, as she apparently wanted to take away the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial section of the stream.
Here you can see "Coasted to happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan rising out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of selling children.
For all this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan is listening to in the video how she continues following the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan misses an ear fig.
Under tears, the actress insists on how shocked she is - and she keeps the cheek.
What Lohan has enlivened about this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7,5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are mentioned.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet been pushed into the devastated areas cut off by the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
At the beginning was a second.
At the beginning of August, Tesla-chef Elon Musk caused unrest on the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro car maker.
The U.S. Board of Directors sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk must pay, and Tesla chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain Chairman of the Board.
British Conservatives' Party Day
Guarded sharply - the party of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
On the occasion of the party's meeting, foreign policy, trade and development policy, the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, to the front of the Ex Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting about these dolls of names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The State of Macedonia is to be called Northern Macedonia in the future, and this Sunday the population will vote for it - whether it's all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood has split in the country.
Thousands went to the street in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazils" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in the front line of the surveys.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer, the "Automobile Week".
The imprisoned and vacationed Audi chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/drive combinations were probably tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we achieved an important stage in the process of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such scandals never occurred again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future and wants to continue to discuss it this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities shall order the Audi boss to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the notification of the exhaust fraud.
In doing so, he knew of the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot is head of the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the changeover to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronn voice".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm should go to the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup Aus and Özil-Affaire next year, wants to run again for the office as DFB President.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" in the early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association found it "remarkable" in its own words, if after the award for the 2024 football club, he did not have a " magnificence to participate in the future project".
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be taken on the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he would also be consulted in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, would be invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether he could become his successor as a DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is exercised by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one has a clear influence on society and football without migration, and says, "The issue is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations where integration needs to work," said Grindel.

Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear track for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball-Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-master easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing game.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of dominating Berlin with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators during his compulsory play debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the mandatory play debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points best pitcher at the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg forced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most reliable shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a significant success.
At the Basketball Lion Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings overpowered the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly created clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver live followers of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the city center of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in service - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have advertised at a joint concert in the New York Central Park for more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease.
"Engage yourself wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday before about 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a startling second, when many spectators thought the sound of a crashing metal block for shots, got scared, and tried to escape.
In a short time, panic arose, and people ran awry.
Seven spectators had been slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizens Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet every year.
Those who wanted to find one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, however, there were cheers and applauses for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons, together, spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thus putting many women in the head.
At least three women have filed abuse accusations up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the accusations after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves, faced him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet in a lift with me at any time," Flake said at the New York concert on the audience.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the outrage of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended a journalist's outrage from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The t-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a great unrest, which is unacceptable.
That's why he's been causing people to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of support or membership in forbidden parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with imprisonment for several decades.
Also foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September was Austrian journalist Max Zirgast arrested.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, there are still processes in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and as good-looking as possible: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for wet-frozen conversations at the counter of the Hamburg port pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, stumbles on some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to ease the mood and tongues.
Not a few promis also drink courage for the mandatory vocal inserts.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männherzen", "Terror - Her Judgment" or "The Geilste Tag".
The Municher didn't get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely broken on it, the eyes only two small slots.
The bed-self shows a completely depleted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: does NOT go to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: Never drink the black Sau.
And spray.
And the round of egg liqueurs, which ina throws at half past three, also lets go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans just posted a few tips to combat the afterlife.
They were sufficient for instant bread, fish rolls, or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller survived the nocturnal uprising, so far it is not known.
However, since she moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly more tasteful...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and Unrat
The entry into the 36-kilometer track in the Redkapchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against the frenzy of vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly clear.
Scherben, Cigarette Chickens, Trash and Unrat, demolitioned trash and now disassembled signposts - for example, the entry with the seat group to the cycle path on the Haäse hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showing object Bahnradweg in Rotkapchenland a more than uncanny sight.
The topic also covers members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt and others for a long time, says the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the Advisory Council.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seat group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüsternhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been brought into the local advisory board.
Not only the trash drives cyclists and residents - the group of seats is regular meeting place on weekends to celebrate.
Not only is it often loud, but the layers are also destroyed: posts are torn out of the ground, trashes are demolded, signs are bent around, seat furniture is smeared.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often than not, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for the suspension.
"Along the entire cycle path, there is clearly the focus here at the Haäße Hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance at the hillside: "It may be that the threshold is significantly higher to get involved in common goods.
However, this would require that a police move pass quickly.
In principle, desert hagen wishes for a development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far can be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no sign of the hare hill.
In case of severe traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road," she explains.
This would not be a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
To offer "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye twinkler in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Cultural Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Unzeit, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Hinig, a long-lived albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a new one.
We haven't seen that in other districts yet.
What were the texts associated with?
In the places the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Hinig named the Allee "Kö von Hiltrup" in his slag-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short remodeling breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann told Franke that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And in the meantime, Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was still something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can hear their songs too.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Unzeit can play a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Further musicians can record a song: Heimig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children once again appeared to the finale - and even without electronic support sounded "right good", as Franke said.
The jury could be guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, access to the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District offensive.
The district offensive had created the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She considered the event to be a full success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "decrypto" in the Game Test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a visual display, in it four cards with keywords, which can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red film - when you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side can not read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, is to read from left to right: "1st Renaissance".
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th Feast.
These are the terms to be encrypted from now on.
Because it is here that we should not guess the terms, but codes.
One player per team alternates is the encryption.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2".
In "decrypto" we should not guess the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dices", "fest" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, as far as possible, win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throwing" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to feast; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prag" because he watched in school and knew the window crash there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although one does not know the terms of the opposite side - it can be better combined with any hint given by the encoder there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not too swirling, the rescripts should be, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic to "decrypto" is the rule issue.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But whoever has first started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessors and genre-primus "Codenames", which also supports an agent theme on a game of less words, but for which it is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's only about guessing and not about winning points, it can also easily find a version for two of them.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasss guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police march, later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he had not complied with the police's given place reference, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the prison cell.
In the fast state, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of non-constitutional organisations.
The company Pressig was home to the Schublocks
For decades, the railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffered with buffers, it was heard all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't bother anyone.
There the brakes squeaked and the wagons gnawed.
That was just a railway.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkels Heimat Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp-mountain track to the north, which after an elevation of about 220 metres has its starting point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and shed blocks were used in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway works workshop with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshop, cab and railway championship.
"Herzstück was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railways.
From the BW Pressig railway plant, which was set up in 1968 by Bamberg, locomotives were also operated for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonnenberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and shed blocks.
From 1977 onwards they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10,000 weights were still placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down, and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that we have not considered a better use of the site, including in freight traffic."
At Pentecost 1989 the railway director Nürnberg celebrated a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig for the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel recalls.
Little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rangers and anti-lockers did the most difficult work in the train," recalls Dinkel.
Any misappropriation would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the infrankPlus article.
Kerber with Retracing Success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund won the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before, Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings three is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian put on number 13.
The Schwabin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened on the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoy" series.
With great relief, the organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the Tourist Association "Round ums Walberla" within the framework of the series "Art and Enjoying".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large visitor's advocacy.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist alike.
Something surprising, but a few days ago, he announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have already actively contributed to the selection of the artists in the past and have contributed to the creation of flyers.
This year there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them on the occasion of art & enjoyment, available at every art station.
There also this year's poster "Betzn austänzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted by the high offer of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was able to be won for the musical envelopment.
As you walk through the generous garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windgame Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
There are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau awaits the visitor.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 windshields, 24 huffs and 24 alu tubes as a piece of sound.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairytalely sung and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind.
In the mid-range, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination shapes made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "windplay performance" is used for gliding through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - This was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtens also aired their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to take part out with the fact that after the Church choir was dissolved, "Cäcilia" should no longer be a Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the tin bush they raised the MGV 68 albachten from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today," thought President Jürgen Holfahrte, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the Foundation Festival for their own anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
At the time of 50 years of existence, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball became it, for festive clothing had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in the "house of meeting" in rows, but at tables.
Meanwhile, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
Honorably, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten heard the voice themselves.
For the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost already said, "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
In addition to the exquisite grape juice, which many had before themselves, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin term for "hopping".
Again sovereign was Richard Homann's choir management, one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holfahrte said: "He has such an easy way, it's a master achievement he does."By the way, not only men presented themselves this time.
The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest whose repertoire includes especially Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk by three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is quite right in League three.
No trace of shy or frack sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) really good against city competitor BW Aasee.
"It wasn't crystal clear, but we already left an impression," says the rather satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately contributed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
On the contrary, we are not dissatisfied."
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a set ball.
"When they bring this to the finish, such a game can be tipped," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine powers and brought the full exploitation to the finish.
"We are all aware of who is in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our necks.
I saw really good volleyball in stages," Annacker didn't have the 0:3, and immediately went on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents, after just three days of play, does not seem to be foreseeable.
"For that it's just too early," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga volleyball, this is not nearly comparable."In the fourth league, they don't want to look down any more.
If the vest is not contaminated in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we're going to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
She now speaks openly about the fact that the series could have been in debt to her marriage date with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief host Beatrice of Ledebur on the dream ship made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series she became a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveling with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my admirable colleagues took me to the eye," says Keller in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
At first, she was always only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the dream ship.
Because now the journalists just called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She considers it possible that her husband of that time might have been quite jealous, but "how many men also feared Hans talks about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed myself", as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I had never really been, even though I sometimes appeared naughty and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I was crying in the wardrobe and trying to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At that time, Keller had introduced himself to love "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have approached love much too naïve."
The night finger, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the Zurich NZZ resort, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our folder isn't a moth, but it's a little shy.
And the glaring shine in which a green carpet is dipped on the six - ringed square blinds it over a fee.
But it's film festival, as more or less famous people want to sunk in the spotlight.
So, on this late Thursday evening, he tore over the square to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis".
The public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called this: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion is a lot of effort to flood a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests who have just had the best-level entertainment in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the festival beginning each year with a party in the three-storey department storehouse.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The whole world ball is known for the works shown.
What don't you have to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into sluggish advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a bundle around the feelers, who have attached a good fairy to him, and two bully doorsteps actually wave him in.
Inside, the invited people push themselves, they dance to live music far after midnight or they can be pretended by DJ rhythms to which they scream at each other, and rinsing down with Cüpli exquisite hooks.
In the delicacy shop in the Souterrain, oysters wait for sluggish mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain sprinkles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has been engaged in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly already saved life.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink does not win the mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who's been advertising for this brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there is a face passing between local fame, cash desk and kitchen items, known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
That's probably not where his main actor is.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with soon sixty almost acting like a choir boy.
He's not being appalled, he's not catched, he's at most stolen.
Especially for this restraint, gladly misunderstanding as a tightness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted by the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, fired by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second-ligist defeated the Leones Negros by 2:0.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican Club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Bundesliga 1: ASV Send after last minute plea "destructed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of ASV's handball band leader, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His shooters were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly for many phases, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have total sleep", the ASV trainer was annoyed.
Soon, at 8:1, the masters of the house did not bring fruit to Bieletzki's early time.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summarized for the second quarter of an hour.
At the time of the break, the residue was only two goals.
Above all, Sends Best, Marius Hintze, met again in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was like 15:15, and then the changer was running almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take action against impartial events.
Bieletzki usually guards against looking for fault with others.
But: The 120-second time sentence Steffen Mühlhoff filed, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four more times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood good against seven men in the back and threw them to the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now there must be a damn victory," says Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Missing woman for 30 years - Police dig by body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday, forces dug up a road at Marxgrün.
To this end, the street floor and several layers of it were taken off, as police and prosecutors jointly reported.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far away from her former place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working with the Public Prosecutor's Office on the case once again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a conspicuousness under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials restricted the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lie in the net.
However, users can also provide additional security.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening appointment as head of the milliard heavy company.
He and the U.S. market surveillance company SEC filed an extrajudicial dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk also leaves the Chairman's office for three years, a position similar to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He's allowed to stay in charge of the board.
In the comparison, which must not be confirmed by a court, no Musk or Tesla admitted misbehavior.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also chairman of SpaceX space company, is the public face of losses of electric car pioneers, who are now rated at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market and pay 420 dollars per share, the financing was secured.
This would have rated Tesla with a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla now has to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the cross-sections of the past few weeks, the Groko filed several surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD overtook the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday for the first time in Germany.
In the weekly poll of the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD increases by 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to last week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes on Sundays.
The great coalition has now lost the majority of the Sunday issue for all major research institutes, except Allesbach.
Government parties reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (all of them: 51 percent).
During the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
In the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: The AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 per cent, and FDP is 9 per cent.
For statistical reasons such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the proportion of votes.
But the retention for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find Merkel to be the right person in the Chancellor's Office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS proved.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wants the large coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, clear popularity losses for Merkel had also been identified.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are for this, 44 percent against it.
As a result, 64 percent of the Union's supporters want a candidate, 35 percent do not.
Hangout at Aldi: Price reduced to happiness of love
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there were no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about puten meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is almost an anachronistic romance for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced puten meat, boxer short snaps at the sink or the favorite pudding is undoubtedly still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact rather than a slippery stock exchange.
We risked the test: How do women react, they don't talk around the hot bridle for long in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potenzial then has it if happiness of love is preceded by an aus-the-eye-lost-and-refound plot.
If the guy also reports himself to his guests under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this annonce in an unknown Aldi branch that she will find her dreamer, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced bio-put meat".
For the faith in the magic of analogy learning she definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Bilderbeck: 500 lid for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the action "Deck Against Polio - 500 lids for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease in German as a child paralysis leads from paralysis to death.

So far, the cause of polyomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be controlled by vaccinations as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And we don't do that well," said the idol-friended Reus after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry at contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football club Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

There's no fixed date when we do that.
"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," said Eberl on Sunday evening in the TV station Sky.
Football: District League: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district leagueist VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) in order to sense the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
It now runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Tauverschreiber Belege is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only thinly pulled by the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We have tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked each individual for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes, the coach had to make a system change.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have happened when the SCA in minute 41 was in danger twice in person of Kevin Volllrath and Chris Naberbaumer before the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his subject.
After the break, the VfL quickly took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left side missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the placers 18 meters before the guest housing.
The foult came himself and demonstrated his danger by standards.
Westhues" thing with the right wing hit down left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes that should be damn long.
And then that: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the penitentiary room unhappyly at hand.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Afraid minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory hit on the pussy in the 87th minute of twelve meters.
Maybe too much of the good would have been.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for Trainer Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.
Sturmer Ante Rebic, who was in the starter after an injury, should help.
He was also a midfielder, Luca Torró, after a sham injury, and with his headball strength should prevent the SGE from depositing further goals according to standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the time of landing there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At about 2 p.m. on Sunday, a drama occurred at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
In the landing of a helicopter, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed against Oe24.
The heli was captured by a windböe, forced on the ground and came to lie down on the side.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately agreed.
With a big offer, the forces came to the accident site.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home autonomously.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigations.
According to fire brigade Franz Resperger, there was a small fire of origin, but it was quickly erased.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 per cent of the executives were female on the 1st of September, as is shown in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and presented to the German press agency in advance.
"Unternehmen will have to stand differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, male-occupied executives - with few exceptions - are no longer imaginable.
The backwardness makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock market companies was also due to positive impulses among the companies of the Medium-Value Index (MDax).
Although according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
However, the value in the previous year was still 3.8 percent.
The number of women stagnated at the 30 dax companies - in recent years.
At last, 26 women worked in the board.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Anchoren.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is given by the Supervisory Boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If the number of women were recruited each year for the board of directors, a 40 percent share would have already been reached in 2023," says the report.
Some even make Mies: Luxury Cargoes: Which manufacturer deserves the most per car?
It's best to earn Ferrari.
The Italians take 280.000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Large cars, big profits: This slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have dealt with this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros of operating profit in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only amounts to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley are even very much on top of each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of between 33,000 and 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train at the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the club will host the wine festivals, which will now climb every Saturday in October in the large Fest tent on Rehweiler Straße.

The President of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine prince Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already full-blown Festzelt. "60 years of doing something like that - this is an insanity for a small village with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of this," said Starz, thanking all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later arrived symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found the way back to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Tromlauers" created a mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the beverage prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before it goes into the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: emergency car power in Taxi
An emergency car is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantin has been injured fatally in the collision of the driver with a taxi.
If notaries are called, they are supposed to help - save people's lives best.
Such a rescue took place in Bonn a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and her driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red traffic light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossroads with the taxi that drove green.
After the collision, the doctor's car sluggished against a traffic light mast and a tree.
He captured the passantin who died at the accident site.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old cab driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from forces.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her anymore.
Another dubbed emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Procuratorate, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
In the 7th round of the Premier League, Manchester United is now losing to the league in the league.
ManU 1:3 is subject to West Ham United. The way of defeat is likely to be spoken.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the restored Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into play.
Since they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defenders remained standing, and Arnautovic spent all the time in the world shooting the ball at helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of an already insufficient performance over long distances.
The mood of United's city rival Manchester City is quite different at the moment.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an approximate 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through for the home team for the first time the defense bar of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal shooter, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool No Longer Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool fought a 1:1 against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As at the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londons.
The score of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only match until the end of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation very little after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his sling.
So after the reds had started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team from Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and through the remis in the league the Blues Liverpool also fell off the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, during which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait against the surprise team of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute for a success report.
Nine minutes ago Watford defender Craig Cathcart gave Alex Iwobi an unfortunate entrance to his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal moved past Watford due to the fifth win in a row and is now behind the great rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Esprito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeated for the fifth time in a row in the 2–0 against Southampton.
VW brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the ringing of bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Salon, they will show their innovations from next week together with competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated until then with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: Although the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, it is not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, among other things, with their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadters will be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Officially, however, both were already presented.
BMW's iNext should only start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well one million visitors came.
In the severe earthquakes and the next tsunami, at least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged, and there have been enormous damage to property.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds of people gathered on the beach to a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still significantly increasing.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other communities affected - along Sulawesis's west coast.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final God service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-passor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental care needs of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of a month at the house Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There about 150 bikers had gathered on Sunday to perform anything other than ordinary worship.
As early as 10 p.m., the Bolids were rows in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a fine curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker’s service of minister Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical support.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetically calm tones," said Fr. Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novum in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a great feast: the milk comes after the apple
And also on the actual action day Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing viewers step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle force from the apples a finely crushed mass became.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it should once become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and surrounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple pieces of layer on top of each other, a little like heels.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult at all.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Fuchtorfer Farmer also had already filled-in specialties.
Thus he opened his "shadow box" and presented the older visitors with the latest spring white.
The demand for the good drop of "Made in Fuchtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up Hüpfburg for themselves.
Active of the Fuchorfer Comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in entertaining games at some stations during the festival.
The local association will also offer an action day in the coming year.
However, as Gregor Krutzkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the Asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season-pleide: "Bissese Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, much positive was not seen at the 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and moved after: "That's, of course, disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met with the result, stand down with two counters and are in their current constitution a descent candidate.
==References====External links==* Official website
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the goals for the DFB Cup winner before 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful general sample for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, proposed seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive action of Hesse and never to get under control by Hanover's defense.
The storm, which has been hit for a long time after the World Cup, showed with its speed and enforcement ability why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan loaned by FC Liverpool was for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began to flourish.
A falsified headball of Lucas Torró (17th) was the first to be in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense against the Brazilian Felipe, which replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (Rücken).
The leadership for the houselords was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball to the penitentiary room after a defence, Haller lengthened by head in front of the gate where Ndicka only needed to stop his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defense player AJ Auxerre, who came in summer.
And Frankfurt was still retracing before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who packed himself through and left no chance for 96-Torwart Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played slightly more courageous forward, however, inflamed ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the connecting hit was still successful.
The Hesses were much more efficient.
After an hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters to watch the overburdened guests, and Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Swirl Despite cold temperatures, there was a good mood at the October festival in the city center.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter managed to do so before millions of people at the opening of the 185s.

Geisinger Christian Celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14th or Sunday after.
Feast service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final victory.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and on whom the legend is said to have shot after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this came a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation, and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was poorly visited.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross church took place and with the conclusion victory the church part of the Cross feast ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish hall for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until the next year.
After the scaffolding had already taken some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual calls for proposals were prepared more specifically.
It is certain that renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has been found, which has only been possible through the in-eye inspection by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal plasters are completed, the natural stone works are still to be started before winter, and one hopes to complete almost half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" is now handed over in the Münsterblickstraße - there were all the people present at the time of the initiation.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the residential home of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test stand for the residents with mobile cap: "The house had come in the years and no longer in modern equipment," said Bader looking back.
In 2016, the excavators started to tear off the house.
The new building should be designed as kindly and brightly as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around 4.6 million euros invested in new construction.
The Free State allocated 2.4 million euros to the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
The construction work, according to architect Bader, has remained in the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He was also thanked by the managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The space between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many regulations that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any other help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its inhabitants who need resources to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real fortune, because it is no longer to be purchased in today's situation".
Overall, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three groups.
Pride is Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz on the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Hardly complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of unity, Deputy SPD President Manuela Schwesig has called on all country people not to deal with the disadvantages of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after nearly 30 years of unit.
We must not be content with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the "Daysspiegel on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It would be unacceptable for East Germans to work longer on average than the people in West Germany, but to get 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German Unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this clean dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang has made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan-Jagdhunde.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, already reached their recipients on Thursday.
So they happened to the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to help the animals "assuming the habit".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship had been announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean powerman Kim Jong Un in Pjöngjang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to join forces for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Toggiog Ri test system for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
To mark the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months since this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the last hundred years.
Quite differently, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archive, will present it in the magnificent "Image Book" Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for government
Back to physical work - this is the unofficial motto for today's working week of the Great Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not conjure the "return to the work" by mantra.
This may have led some tradesmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work in work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission - to governing - it should not now be held back by means of term debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blumbers of the last few weeks will possibly show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to elucidate conflicts early; a lesson from all the fights.
At first, however, conflict-stricken issues are on the agenda with the diesel retrofitting and the skilled labour immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to get rid of car companies with exchange premiums glaringly, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the duty to retrofit older diesel.
While an approach has been drawn in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned Professional Immigration Act.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or make an education.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has come together to the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social views and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society so diverse, sometimes contradictory, does not move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be built up again on the question of being or being non-existent for party-tactic reasons.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight - but always have in mind the reality of life of the people.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both diesel and track change questions can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the national parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the visor
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable law of the Service?
Daniela Holtinger wants to look more closely at this.
"Real Day and Night" had worked on social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister in the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of list-pilz-mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes as a surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament by question.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not to announce any violations of applicable service rights in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "acquite Har tinger from any suspicion".
Police are tearing a street in search of women's lay
Marxgrün - Long the police did not want to express themselves.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is still closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its leader, could finally limit the relevant site to a few meters.
In addition, a ground anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said road section.
For more than a year, public prosecutor and criminal police court have been dealing with the missing case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here in the course of the new building of the state road, Heike's body might have been distorted 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: cramps in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will last for the first time.
But before that, it comes to cramps.
The separatists have not forgotten the use of the police in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, there were conflicts between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 officers from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use in the constituencies last year at the illegal referendum.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was violence at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would have tried by force to break the police chain, and the officials, among other things, would have thrown color bags and eggs.
Six people had been arrested, 24 others had been slightly injured, and the authorities had been called upon to do so.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum will be held.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to divide the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had forced Catalonia to manage in autumn 2017.
At that time Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections had been held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also exists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Gathered inadequacies: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
In the FC Gütersloh there was only one 0:0 disagreement.
The final light and the third last they exposed before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a gathered inadequateness.
The first half were arrogable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, if you would rather get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do so unafraid.
There was no danger of missing a tor chance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and, in principle, only real - possibility had the Ahlers, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison room border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mutzel was about 18 meters away from the housing and after an hour the goods lodgers were also appearing offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented counter via Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but a little shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) they relocated after a cornerball of the ex-ahler Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka to Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mutzel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not achieve.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to remove the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero also stood at the front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against the development of wood, and even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlens Interimtrainer.
Offensively, everything "placed so much" against a team that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a counter gate," Daut said.
However, as a spectator, one did not feel that his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erwerbmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
This is what Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Edition Centre for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers insure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was bright blue, the place was still a little empty, but that was still to change during the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice sociable, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with an ordinary price humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jump in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creamers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the more and more visitors in between.
It was so good that at a later hour some folk songs were sung.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"In fact, there should not be something like a table at all," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean Up" action that took place in September.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here goes something.
Then the Mayary was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to winter quarters.
Many stands were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was created on his decoupier's day.
Furnace work, beer lid with reckfield motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A speciality offered three reckfield beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wiedershoven and Helen Roth-Busschlüter.
The latter still has a speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the gathering that allowed the visitors to stay long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably drawn up hardly any kind of way for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohn of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been fined for property damage.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that already after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertising sign at the steps up to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at the time had apparently been left "only" with an edding, it could have been removed without problems.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time spraying," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the embroidered board.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate plant.
After the old at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke out for the majority of the firearms parking lot.
However, this approach was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohn says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the city councillor.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote can be built in 2019.
Closer air traffic control passport is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Safety Union, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long known staffing need for European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for well-trained lotsens has been empty.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal, state, aviation, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not happen without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members in the German air traffic control company.
Maas was once again responsible for the Lotsen Misers for the EU Commission.
Transport forecasts for the current regulatory period by 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in national air traffic security now fully meet the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for rules that "do not cut the air any further."
At present, EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening should be feared.
The EU has been exposed to constant lobbying by the airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of the airlines would lead to a rethinking.
The GdF would only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Safety (DFS) offered a "vote training and future pact", said Maas.
The annual intake of 120 pilots over the next five years, announced so far, is just enough to compensate for age-related exits.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Council unanimously voted in favour of the plans for restructuring the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Management at the Sunday meeting, the critical group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in personnel beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is said to contain, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industries AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos by police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have seen violent conflicts with many injured people.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independents.
The Catalan police had tried with a big bid to keep the two protests away from each other.
However, according to the forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security lock.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwshots.
According to the figures, there were also between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to honour colleagues who had been against the Spanish Central Government's non-existent independence referendum in Catalonia almost a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
The Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was provocation that the Spanish police protested in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?", asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that a year ago they drowned us.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is in place to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona, because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the police assured.
Panne permitted access to the personal data of British ministers
A vulnerability in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and delegates of the British Conservative Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the Panne became known a day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve Trainer praising by top part: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storm "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia," said Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3-1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchase of the star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early delay through the hits of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and depended on the worst pursuer for the time being.
The Torjäger, who was picked up by Real Madrid, initially imposed on the former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who provided the leadership with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work after a corner by headball for the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had only to step in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record tournaments.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve Tourer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' supremacy seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points the master of the past seven years has already six counters advantage on Naples.
The tables, trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, were not chanceless against Turin.
But not later than after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the square after getting too hard on Paulo Dybala with yellow red.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has won at Juve.
==References====External links==* Official website
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had fled the square at the 2–0 victory of the Turiners and was locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly bizarre performance, Rapper Kanye West has given attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided foreheads and question marks for the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye," says the musician.
"The creature that was once known as Kanye West," he twittered in response to the late singer Prince, when he took his name.
However, the pseudonym is not a novelty.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the KRRL radio station, the artist had declared that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
That's it!
Hoetmar's coach, Averhage, made no success from his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more gripping, we've put him almost never before before.' Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar shooting options reads thinly.
Grades of two goals in 90 minutes, so that games can only rarely be made positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to an early lead (7.).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased uphus, but after a great preliminary work by Krause, he was free standing.
The hosts had only a double possibility when first Moritz Höne failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the addition Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all gave up.
A trader - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the gate line and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide hit the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had previously harshly criticized ourselves, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leidig), Turl.
Towers: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We don't have access to it at all," he thought, "with this, he thought, "the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites that were noticed with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, swung back and pulled off from then His players was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noticed, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we keep against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top-tour hunter Lars Zymner guided the hosts with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2:0 on the left side decisively for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can't be taken out completely.
"That was crazy already," Lewandowski mercilessly acknowledged the opponent's quality.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own Elf managed to compensate: McGill's release from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torchüter Hinkerohe through the long toreck (45.).
After the change of sides it was again McGill, who made the compensation (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later did Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite overnumbering, Albersloh did not manage to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against schapdettes, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kroger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Frohning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow red: Atalan (74./Albachten).

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish president was in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has now signaled that he would like to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: As President of the Federal Republic of Germany, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn approached him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us." That the Academy at Tutzing Castle repeatedly appeared prominently, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings by mid- 2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not safe!" says a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes "the risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: Barbarian without limit."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war detests any human idea".
The spectrum extends from structural racism in society to the sheer between the poor and the rich to radical changes in the work through digitization.
Akademie Director Hahn convinced himself: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to search for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting to 200.
Karl Marx's birthday is about to be expected to be a more visitor to capitalism, while others are more likely to be "from outside the left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ's Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner was able to understand gender, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeled) wife and (feel) man and what else may exist, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, this is one of the male sparring partners, who sometimes also comes to terms until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenially harmoniously accompanied that some might have wanted a solo.
That was also true, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it fit the Red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man, if he had a partner, but he did not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo is now demonstrating the same thing: What would have escaped from Mozart's composition, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp slides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "lied of death", and Mozart g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But President Heidemarie Markenbeck could not accept an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo a show in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as a one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"I was actually happy with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get under control," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many left out opportunities.
The concentration in the finale made his team miss this time.
Therefore, the ASG ran almost until the end of arrears, lay at the end of the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostess make themselves decisive.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the outside of the left, which then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkotter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue Whites won with 3:1 at VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," said Trainer Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team with the crashed table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost as desired.
At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-master of the previous year.
Eating has taken place in the two barn, but has not come into play.
We've been very busy with her.
Our opponent has been at high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "Eating has changed the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't keep the extra pressure.
Food has gotten sucked up, and we've got a little bit inhaled," Münch continues.
In 1817, the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their noses in front of them.
In 19:24, East Bevern resisted four sentence balls, but the fifth attempt came to his finish.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise manager said to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge, with their additions, made a significant contribution to the BSV's turning the sheet from 14:16 to 25:21 in the third section.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly there."
About 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passage brought four with 25:22 to their sides.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the large Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the Mosque opening in Cologne left a pile of shears, which can only be brought together effortlessly," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance of a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Besides with German top politicians to underline the membership of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," lamented Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally folk treff time again.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Officials.
It's almost on the day exactly then a year ago that we've performed a folk show for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," said Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk treff would be in Nottuln so fast.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the official was always fully occupied.
"The programme at the next folktreff is like always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailors songs, folksongs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermauer, who invites always friends musicians to Nottuln.
On the first Folktreff "Birth Day" Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of Gaitling, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with flat-German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish-folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," says the local association's invitation.
Those who play an instrument and want to be active are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always fast occupied, it is recommended to be there in a timely manner.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but entrance is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair

This means that the approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - in the United States are still outstanding for the billion-severe merger.
Finally, according to an insider, there had been improved opportunities there because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinungshaus, the last founding impulses were set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
Of course, he was still different at the time: As "Bzirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from that of today's work - it was actually about fruit-growing, flowers and horticulture nobody thought at that time.
"At that time, at the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festival lecture.
Fruit trees should line long distances, so-called industrial gardens have been established in schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7,000 members.
But by far the spectrum is not exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the provision of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerp" presented entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said the district president Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of nature's experiences for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with Smartphone & Co. you can collect a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the Kreisverband decides", added Landrat Söllner and stressed the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt to the district management and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the Kreisverband and reported among other things the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was put in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature is in existence, it was there before us and we have to focus on it," pleaded the specialist for fruit and walnut trees.
Therefore, for the horticultural associations, there is the incentive not to let go so that our home country remains beautiful and viable.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline of insects, we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN-Red
Mexico's government wants clarity in the matter of Nafta: they put both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the Trade Agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure to reprint the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, she told Adam Austen.
In the meantime, it concentrates on the renegotiation of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the USA had reached an agreement for 48 hours if Canada were to actually accede to the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the USA.
The US and Mexico had agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they will now be completed, Trump's government intends to submit the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designed President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous streets in Hanover.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a trade fair attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report from the daily "O Globo" where he lived.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on open street at an election event in South Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people in several Brazilian cities went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Not") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations made racist and disdainful statements against Bolsonaros.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economic metropolis.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil was held on 7 October.
As ex-citizen of the million-city of São Paulo, Haddad was so far far far far behind the right-wing extreme candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump Brazils" has long been involved in the political business, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round, there will be an election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed in this - no matter who he is acting against.
Bolsonaro is known for his hatred of homosexuals and blacks and the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the followers of Lula's left-wing workers party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jepzesen reported on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen had been surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement as "Street Boys", who "was against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at air level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure by three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands excitedly delight the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the latest, unknown pieces from his own spring and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced to the vocal and pressureful interplay of the band.
Although "addition" calls cannot be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used for guitar rock at "Here We Stand".
Not only the longingly ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has developed a special awareness since its inception in 2005.
Full agility the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its appearances in front of a large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and insurmountable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays with the band in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
At the time, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an overjoyed solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of the genre of such a hard rock concert: The Mint Mosquito rock night, according to the mixing board team, is at the threesome concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the press air hammer level, but is still clearly below the control of the "wacken-fesitvals", to indicate the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need an ear-drenching 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual in the annual metal standard in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gang style have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the transferred sense, can say in the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead person in a sailing plane accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
At Mülheim/Essen airport, there has been a fatal accident.
A sailing plane crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen airport, there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailing plane was crashed at the Messeparkplatz at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student had been on board by himself - the pilot is supposed to be a resident.
At the time of the accident, the aircraft had already arrived on the landing plane.
The crash site is located only a short distance from a fortress on the airport site.
But an October festival has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the driveway to highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen trade fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump likes Kim, "And then we fell in love."
The fact that US President North Korea's power holder Kim has been well received despite nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love for his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "Wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has become known for a new flame.
The Tragic: It is a remote relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean powerman Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-aged spross of Pjöngjang's ruler dynasty, although it proves to be rather tough chunks in the rings around North Korea's atomic disarmament.
"I was tough, he was too, and between us it went back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced stop of all nuclear and rocket tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip confession.
The fact that the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - is not likely to be any memory, seemed to be quite aware of the US president.
At any rate, he took the likely criticism of this in his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling immediately ahead: "Donald Trump says they're in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidious.
But he didn't care much about this, Trump explained and then directed his index finger to the crowd: "I always told you it was so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this brightly filled arena, but we only had 200 people standing outside.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's visit to the best, atmospheric and above all spoiled by the sun full: very varied and with a good shot of Octoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city centre has been cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the Festzelt am Feuerwehrturm, but was extended to the city by the Trade Association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued by video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile video and thus enabled their rescue.
The group had shot in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under the risk of life and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", the editors of which alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya when trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his competitors was almost killed by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the prison conditions were disastrous: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their home country this year by means of the programme, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a cell phone call yet.
International organizations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lesson for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building above the main entrance.
In the front hall of the 1st floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase into the ground floor or the front court.
The teacher agreed with the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.

Please contact the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central France after he had locked the car off all the forest roads and blocked a tree from the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the passenger car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and released the missing one since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld is said to have been in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road vehicle over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man’s remains remained unclear for days.
Laschet recommends rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has recommended the rule of law in Turkey according to his own information.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns mainly waves of arrest, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan "that if relations are to normalise themselves in the future if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important condition for this".
According to his own information, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan had recently been transferred to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to have taken place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation at the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the USA: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of stressing the success of the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sobering.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's presence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking the negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The latest standstill therefore comes that the US builds on forced measures that are deadly for building trust," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat explained.
That punishment could force North Korea to "knead" is "a wishful dream of people who don't know us".
However, in order to build confidence, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic testing plant, Ri highlighted.
On the US side, however, there had been no "corresponding reactions", the Minister criticized.
In view of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone had decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have called for strict compliance with the sanctions in the United Nations over the past few days.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June Trump first met North Korea's powerman Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President aims for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will travel to Pjöngyang again for talks about the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The hot served: new kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT did not get anything: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thanks to God.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the bad surprise came: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was corrupt and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from the beginning: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone took it.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It's better not to cook," said a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido's pumpkin was served or the guests were allowed to serve themselves on quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people put on their feet," said Fr. Frank Beckmann, while sorcerer Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, was amazed.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Directors NRW of the board
From frustration about criticism from its own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, gave his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essen panel had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-president of the NRW tables, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I fell in my back too many times.
The head of the Tablets Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took away the harsh criticism.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essene board did this."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized in the "world on Sunday" criticism of colleagues from other tablets.
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city are starved."
It is up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of the tablets on Friday in Berlin.
"That's where I'm told too much sweet chat," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0-Führung - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV hypocrites wins in Kirchheim after residue - Bettringen clears Lauchheim.
At 2:0 Lorch was already on the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end it stood 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly hit back with 0:1, but after 90 minutes, the TV hypocrites won 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to reach the top of the table with a 3:0
Gladbach playful double guided tour - Schalke without embryo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a guided tour twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season win (1:0).
(sda) In the first five league games, Schalke has maneuvered into the distance with early counters.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind the Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf guided the home-equipment in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka by head, as a result the hosts preserved the mini pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the head of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had entered into a 0:2 retreat against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half of the season it was still a 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Brun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) similar with a double inert four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86.94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear the war against Milos Veljkovic, who had already been decimated before the break for a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unobtrusive Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curiosic inspiration-owner that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a fully successful but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a guided tour twice, finally played 2:2 and have been waiting for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
He was responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation for the 1:1, and Renato Steffen was responsible for his second Bundesligator.
In the 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite hesitant.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa sees himself as a goalgetter.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase came from the OGC Nice for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh game of duty.
After seven rounds, Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeatable Werder Bremen manoeuvring itself against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by an Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season hit, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbe filed against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot after a jersey cup.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game through a curious cast-in-owner (68th), one quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the overt Stuttgarters back to Siegesstrasse.
Nürnberg decided against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens was already on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
Today, in Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens vote on the need to change the name of their country to Northern Macedonia.
In a yes, the almost three decades-old conflict with the neighbor of Greece could be solved.
As a result of its northern province, Athens had insisted on a change of name and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beaten three pensioners and in some cases injured them.
The 41-year-old asylum seekers ransacked in the escape alley in Alsergrund on Friday at around 10 a.m.
When the police came in, they spoke to the accused, who, with his fists in hand, tried to attack passersby and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
As a result, the Syrian tried to beat and step the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on Währinger Street at a tram stop.
In addition, he had stepped the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partly seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises, and convulsions.
The asylum seekers were also seriously injured "for still unknown cause", as the police called it.
He was hospitalised and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not been in question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD-Bundestagsfraction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had aroused a rage.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "interpreted" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens' Association Children's House and the Society for Leproximity.
Because around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, president of the Association of Citizens.
And it's got a lot of things together.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but luckily, it's just a cut of shape.
Because already in spring the hedge has already been shaved.
The breakfast that always follows on the work also has a long tradition.
"They should all stay with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner Wins Gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the Kanuslalom World Championship.
The 29-year-old set a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympic course.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides here on the plant and it has fit everything today," said the Olympic Third of London 2012.
In the goal, he threw away his paddle from joy and pulled both arms to the heights, knowing well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not peak his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting mentions the first attempt at the fall in a family house.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.
This is what the police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday was the first attempt at this fall.
The fact that it has remained on the Königswieser Straße in an attempt at the single family house is due to the alarm system.
She started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday shortly before 8 p.m.
The burglars did realize that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they escaped without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, Phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite at Hertha: Collected by reality: Bavaria demands against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants to be "not liked" by the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small power cell under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to the greater autumn depth for the Munichs.
"One week ago, one had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has caught up with us," said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions-League-Duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that this is really annoyed and that's why we're heading for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no one's own goal was shot out of the way, as at the same time of the previous season, two compulsory games in series without victory, the table tour in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the first time.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks across the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the most powerful Bavaria is to be cracked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we're going to do everything to make us succeed again," Kovac stressed.
On the other hand, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his birthplace and moved his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, the first interim of his term of office would nevertheless be a positive one - otherwise the tone would probably increase.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-round game against Ajax begins, which, for the start of AEK Athens, had also overcome with 3:0 sovereignly.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we're going to make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich Klartext spoke above all.
The defenseman acted in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think that's all bad, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the variety of opportunities and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern even had five counters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with one point.
And so Kimmich valued with an eye twinkling at least positive that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Shot Line: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attack by Erdogan an Grindel
With heavy accusations, Turkish President Erdogan advocates an exclusion from Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the line of association.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for interpretation in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president, at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, strongly criticized the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany, the DFB chief defended the union line.
On the early Sunday morning, the grindel personally attacked by Özil in the Mainz ZDF "sports studio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"We must draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-teams - that something like this does not repeat," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integrational representatives.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Born and raised in Germany, Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Cathedral.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have gone up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt that the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan, had "treated reasonablely by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German when I lose, I'm Migrant - I can't.
"I very much regret the fact that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Meshut more, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Özil to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, which has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed as a result.
"If one has a clear influence on society and football without a migration background and says, "The topic is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup Aust and Özil-Affaire, he wants to register again for the office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Roedental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 1 pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauter Höhe.
He told the pensioner that he was driving her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel, since the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a phone call from a car driver who got off the road and drove against a guide.
Addressed, the man didn't want a police station and then drove away from it.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has been working in his place of residence in which he has lived for decades and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a perplexing impression and could no longer think of much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 forces in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal defence grounds in Emsland, 980 forces are still engaged in the extermination work.
That was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
According to a speaker, since the situation continues to be stable, the last 70 volunteer helpers were removed.
A further reduction in the number of workers is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was announced well a week earlier on September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would put forests and settlements adjacent to them by wind and radio flight at risk.
Thursday, it was said, a breach of the fire on neighbouring communities no longer threatens.
In time, more than 1500 forces on site tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for the 2nd and 5th October.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets that Airbus technicians fired.
The moor-burned flag had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers across the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two of them have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not been in question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD-Bundestagsfraction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had aroused a rage.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "interpreted" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighboring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote with Yes, they will also give the start of the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have grown 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prizewinner dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for the afterworld.
Switzerland launches electronic index for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be withdrawn only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) This Monday, Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Their wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs can only be removed with explicit consent, says Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donation card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"You then have to choose the person who died, which is often very stressful," so always.
A similar registration system already exists in Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations about storing information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Information, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - pro or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has voted in favour of a re-regulation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered organ donors unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head calculation
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the lead calculation.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 fellow fighters.
This was reported by Martina Flame-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of whom was a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Former tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, during which participants approached guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when he calculates.
He's one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Grüß was present two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can start little.
"Calculator can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computer competitions in stages.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing of six digits.
When calculating versatility, candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, said the chief referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favour, because there are already in early childhood head-calculations more intensive and with other effective methods learned.
An urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows up from her sensitive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer and make himself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only their hands hide their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection, which can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency op was started to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena’s lung.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a draft law on the so-called "symbol law" in review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the west on the mountains
Mrs. Holle shakes her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polare Kalt Luft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) the snowfall limit falls at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could be snowing down to about 1,000 meters with strong intensity, it was called.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern you can expect 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow above 2,000 metres.
Thus, on higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsicht, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday.
The "green whales" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the wooded state for some 200 years.
The tree and shrub fences, which are up to five meters wide, are "forests" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scatteredly located habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
In 1766, the Knicks were set up on the basis of an order from the Danish king Christian VI, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialist houses.
From that time his name "Knick" also came: The dense, intertwined demarcations could be developed by "connected" branches.
Today, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a woody, diverse landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by some 7,000 species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he takes care of a light series of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also reduces the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
Knickpflege may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
In an interview with the German editorial network (RND), the local radicals Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
You were on site during the tsunami yourself?
No, I was in Jakarta right now on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, and she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have set up something provisionally, where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are running on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and petrol.
Public service has gone down completely, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How does communication and information provision work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they do not know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquake, but, for example, on the way to work.
The tsunami warning system didn't work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they are running on the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific fire ring, prepared for earthquakes?
Yeah, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werders: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from the VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
In the 2-1 against Werder Bremen, Aogo had a muscle fibrous crack in the back left thigh on Saturday, the football nationalist announced on Sunday.
At Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games even after the next national game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibrous crack usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The film festival of San Sebastián closes annually the reigns of the most prestigious European festivals.
All departures to the cinema in spite of this can be summarized: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that could draw a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to catch an injured duck.
The action however went on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers on the Olchinger Lake noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the Water Watch Station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could encircle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then put in a transport box after almost an hour by a fireman with a hearted handle.
The duck injured at the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU in Oberschleissheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather small.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard at World Cup Medal
4th place at Olympia was Biathlet Julian Eberhard long in the stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to reclaim the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the one to grab near medal.
Seven tenths of a second were missing in the end on bronze.
"I have deliberately left time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym-Fitness Studio in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The more motivated the pinzgauer is to repeat the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the constitution, to win something.
Then you have to hit it sometime.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I already closed the track to the heart," he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the mass start-up competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the past world cupwinter.
He finished second in Oslo (NOR) with the season.
Kavanaugh Board: FBI study at the Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned experiences is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turboempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the court candidates who are disputed because of accusations of need.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday for the investigators to clarify the suspected incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama for the vocation of Kavanaugh accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer held an annoyance against opposition democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the arch conservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends consented.
President Trump, who had still called the heavy premise on Thursday as a "cushion", initially contained further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in happiness".
That way, he said, the last doubts could be resolved.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the democrats because they reject Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, said one government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They're not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device of the town of Ried installed in a "civil vehicle" for monitoring the tempo limit is located on the garden road from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One has felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penitentiary room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, the royal blues were still able to bring the short 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first season victory under roof and compartment.
It could actually have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco had given safety: "To sum up, the first half-time was good, both playful and from pressing," apparently more and more the head played a role with increasing play time.
Actually, don't create any headball monsters.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore they continued to withdraw.
And defend against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who with his headball hit did not have an insignificant part: "I am actually the worst football player in the Manschaff".
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks from it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can be happy for a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to go to games for over 90 minutes
The largest manco of the afternoon: King blue missed it to worry about more clearly conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who met twice the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shivering victory," Tedesco said, "you've felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column visible in the Leitzachtal 2 km
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at about 1.30 p.m. saw a fire.
Now the police are finding out.
Fischbachau - The cause of the police and fire brigade soon found out: An unknown had lit on a two-square-square-meter area on the Gschwenner Berg Müller.
According to police, it seemed as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the gluten unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer Feuerwehrler were busy with the disintegration and deletion.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at an eye level
Before them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - that association that cooperates with the "Culture Policy" alliance during the evening's orientation.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligibly.
With a lot of gesticism, hand-fixed numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
At a table the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether you order yourself politically to the right or to the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
In the beginning, the discussion round is starting more and more rapidly.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective that two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani is ahead, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not force his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because "at first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signer's hour, he has also been discussed in depth for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win start-up games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Gießen was in a hard-knit game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
After the 112:55-Gala on Saturday, Alba Berlin is the first leader of the season against Science City Jena.
Significantly more effort was made at the beginning of the new season of German champions Bayern München and former series champion Brose Bamberg.
Munich already made an effort on Friday at 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first properties in the new Landsham-Süd building area on the free market.
That's what Mayor Roland Frick reports.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at cheaper conditions and prices is complete - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the goal is to have established the candidate list for the 20 properties by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the site in the south of Landsham and four areas for multifamily houses with probably eight units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads are about to be asphalted.
A single plot and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most on the free market, 20 properties in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily houses of the municipality are to be built as an affordable living room.
With a total of 16 residences supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
It is estimated roughly on the surface of the new Landsham-South residential area for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, early October, according to Frick, the start is there for the new construction of a day care centre.
Three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose area are to be accommodated.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "big sport" on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the beginning: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-meter-old Brazilian had spoken about the soul so correctly.
But when the Skalker players gathered as usual in the middle circle after the 1–0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco at all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom all call Naldo simpleness, turned on and said, "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction to his vice-captain, who, despite his reservist existence, did not close any grudge.
It is true that Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best shalker, knows that he was not actually on the line with his coach - but for good reasons he gets a break.
A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the launch.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that we can all get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which finally caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry accelerated in August as compared to the eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
However, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, the Markit Institute reported on Monday to 3,000 companies on its survey.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row under the 50-point mark that indicates growth.
Ireland's only industry cracked this threshold at 50.9 points in August.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, although the mood barometer fell, it was slower than in the months before.
In Spain the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst thing has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in any case in the third quarter - remains growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the euro area have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore reduced posts for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China, too, fell more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on representative surveys by 3,000 European industry companies.
Developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are raised, among other things.
Tilel's PSG team succeeds behind victory in the eighth league
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice Trainer Thomas Tuchel continues to win with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won with 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two hits by Superstar Neymar and was successful in the eighth league.
Olympique Lyon had recently made such a good start in the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar guided PSG after 22 minutes and made the final stand in the post-playing season.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) took care of the 2:0 in the meantime.
This also made Paris the general sample for the groundbreaking second Champions-League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At 2:3 in Liverpool, Tuchel's team had had to take the only compulsory game defeat this season.
