Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes the continuing settlement of Israel and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal about the Iranian nuclear program, which was advertised by Obama, further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the US Congress, which was partly regarded as an affront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, but a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election that was to come in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note, which was shriveled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to take it back, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he reportedly killed and killed a popular historian, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime later.
There was another death until the end of the day: Lamb took his life when the police wrapped him up.
One day after the shooting in the university, students and teachers forced themselves to hide behind locked doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies toward problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beaver, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the PhD, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in spring.
One of the longtime friends of Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate from a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house that is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed on a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night September 5th, after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and kidding each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight commemorative celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwach, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The class will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that in his emergency call, Lamb called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to employ less workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says he'll give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 people were still employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I noticed that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawning and an arm's length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "the biggest time-travel film ever filmed."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year-long conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the margins of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values showing that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper ranks in surveys, it has not (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit field, and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the electoral period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain at that time in 2011, none of which won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But outsiders such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's sustainability and begin to make their dollars flow to crash it.
Here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are kept in early countries.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "indulgent" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "annoyed" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be "spirited" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to live in Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament did not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly huts, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If you're asked who's most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A close majority of Donald Trump fans say they have expressed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump, in his election speech two months ago, called immigrants from Mexico " Rapists", immigration was a turning point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep essential Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
The frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post's new Monday survey, they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also mad at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "sudden".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street a square meter of a reed roof house costs 73,300 euros on average.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," the study says - therefore the high price.
A new study shows which special locations cost one square meter the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student house in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top living places, however, one of the prizes appears like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meters in dizzying heights.
There are once more tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, well-marked.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here, except in the first place.
Champions League: Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goaler in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiako's Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52.90.+2) and Götzes Hits (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th series launch is to be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to pick up the Henkelpott in Munich on the third run.
At his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller was awarded a fine co-help from Olympiako's Torwart Roberto, who had a shot of the world champion as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," promised Bavaria captain Philipp Lahm before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also stumbled here.
But the Bayern, unconquered in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran boldly, but often too imaginative in their offensive efforts at work.
The attacks were launched too often by relocating left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown hit the headball of the Pole from the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the torwart Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayern grew up their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needlesticks.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was left.
For example, when he led a shot of ideye over the latte (56.).
Before the new, Guardiola had a four-chain chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, was sitting outside at first.
The World Cup hero did not give green light until after the final training, did sports director Matthias Sammer say at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something else out of it is already evil."
On the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller put another on it.
Before the game, the stadium had come into confluences.
After a smaller group of partially disguised Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and fought with batons against the Munich followers.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium transported.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
He who smokes not only harms the lung, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
Good news: In case of remission, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smoking was at risk of losing their teeth early to the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammations of gums, the DifE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore results in more frequent inflammation of the gums.
It was not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the threat to return to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, study manager Heiner Boeing of the DIfE said: "Smooth shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DifE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supported the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from the late Antiquity at the Cologne Rhine shore
Archaeological findings have been made for the time being on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhein Boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have dug skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called floor monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological floor monument care.
The archaeologists were found in the third section of the Rhein Boulevard.
From text documents had already been known that a fortress had been built in the place of the 4th century and a church was built in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman from freight trains recorded
After a young woman has failed at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police asks the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning about 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the track from the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, by recording the train, it suffered serious injuries from it.
She was treated as an emergency on site and brought to a hospital by rescue workers.
There is no evidence of the reason why young women cross their tracks at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) will be in question.
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided under 24 hours and free hotline of the Federal Police Department under telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes in dispute over TTIP new court
In order to remedy the dispute over the planned Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The contentious private conciliation bodies for disputes between corporations and States are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its functioning, corresponds significantly to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system to which citizens trust," said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström during the presentation.
The Swedish has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.
The German Government announced its support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the US to jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court.
They should be equally from the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is also foreseen for the first time.
It would allow it to object against judgments.
To date, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, and there has been no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court, according to its own information.
For example, there could also be disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) required in particular by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies are able to claim damages to taxpayers, remove national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact considered the proposals of the EU Commission insufficient.
It was particularly criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as major progress.
The Commission took into account essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had prepared in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the business opportunities through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, it was said.
When the talks on the TTIP Free Trade Agreement (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, we were still unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, investor protection has not been discussed with the USA.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be non-sustainable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells from various places, which he repeatedly records on the map, what his minutely and delicately arranged songs report about.
Where they came from and what it looks like there in his home country.
Stevens has since proved to be a wonderful creative fool.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003, the songs appear cleverly composed, which are harmoniously close to the American folk of the late sixtys, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a weighty series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near Rhein, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens' appearance here.
Live he's full of guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the show.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a widely celebrated masterpiece will be released in 2005.
Overwhelming ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises into the American billboard charts and is not lacking in any year's best list of influential music media.
After highly productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offset pieces.
This sixth neat studio album is still widely orchestrated, however worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs escaped, the stage shows will become the colorful spectacle of neon frontbands and large fluorescent stage endoco.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark Hamburger Mehr!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now banned in their chairs, the well-matured Stevens returns to intimacy and to folk.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears: the talk is more "opulent" and one can thus throw away the "Platte in principle".
Only for an addition does Steven thank himself modestly, plays very few older songs, and finally bows down under a loud applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut has been eagerly expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch, with his performance being probably examined by the media and the Labour delegates from nearby.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour President's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs and is at the heart of several front pages in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said that he had been "standing in respectful silence" and he had recognized the "hero of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour president to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "hopping" within labour, according to Mr. Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow-work and pension ministers, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairperson to stand opposite David Cameron, since he was Tory Chief, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in Parliament.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will not be able to do both "difficult" and struggle with reversing, and instead he will focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister of Economic Affairs will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had spoken to John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle-Theater", which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time. But several years later, he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the House and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Geßssen in Joburg': homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn the livelihood.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds increase by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound jumped according to data showing an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the United Kingdom's non-boni earnings grew by 2.9% over the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has been estimated at the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was up to 0.84 % against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after the takeover offer of the Rival AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again showing growth.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said he had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment of the company rating on "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lapped 21 years old, a hemp with superschicker hair.
The guy with the platinum-blond hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 in the morning, however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs of Berlin's luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Beeber building: Here your idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, has been living since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs as much as her mother Ewa deserves in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "My Wiktoria would actually have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymnasium."
"I'm gonna fill her with a dream."
compulsory schooling?
Who's itin'?
The fans don't.
Not even beeber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the Superbowl he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed many, many dollars on the beeber account.
And every doll that looks like he's going over and over the shop table also cashes Bieber.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, one surprises at the window pane.
He's supposed to have exploited more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebaneses to Potato Done Idea
Potatoes or doners?
It goes both way - in the potato dune, which Oldenburger Imbisser Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "Carton instead of Doners" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spear.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartons instead of Doners", which he happened to see on television.
Since then, in his store, a grilled mirror has been turned, equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to betray how much meat and how many potatoes the spear contains.
Only so much: "It tastes better together," he finds.
Also with its customers the culinary understanding of the people is good.
Metcash launches ground-resistance campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA Supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and building up the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media, as well as through events and Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, selling discounted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers with brands such as ice manufacturers Simmo from Dunsborough, who distribute samples in IGA stores and shop owners.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment will carry out its annual investor strategy day.
It is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA charging business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that, twelve months after opening his first markets, Aldi will take away around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to one report published this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East States, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it's assumed that a metcash board member contacted Mr Douglas's last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction at the same time as pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler spends more than $150 million to balance sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's Chief Executive Officer, Ian Morrise, says that the price adjustments and shop-rehabilitation programs will be to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collaral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is often referred to as "Special Ks", came into the spotlight by the infamous discussion of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, and Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen breaking a tennis racket after a cramp beat a potential US open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against the UK.
"One thing I'm quite jealous about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into the fight," said Healy.
He broke a beater when he lost to the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a beater out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well in the U.S. opening, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he is trained hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term firm."
"First of all, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has made the climb very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the spotlight he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary explains emergency situation, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and signed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to get into the country illegally. Everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one's country and responded with pity to Serbian officials.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents for an unknown period of time and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian preparedness police.
Some returned food and water from protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks must take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border did not reach a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would finally be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that the EU states would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or by its neighbours.
The emergency on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not refugees who are entitled to protection - an opinion that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also set higher prison sentences for condemned traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border for days with vehicles and dogs.
Gyorgy Bacondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others were already more deeply invaded into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push in there.
About 20 were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage from Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to take a two-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic electorate.
More than five months before the start of the elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only down here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years of age has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage for the older voters.
Last month Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit advantage with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage with this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe not surprisingly that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastic about supporting it.
While 48 percent of the democratic electorate say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the electability are also quoted.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the presidential office into the scales, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so.
If democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, biden is at the forefront.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say Biden would be their second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the democrats, Hillary Clinton's advantage will rise before Sanders, from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this figure of 78 percent has fallen last month.
biding is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the most "selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, on the question of what is more important in a candidate, democratic voters raise questions about the electability.
Similarly, as in the last month, no one Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-elections is found to be unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some important features of the electorate of their party.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden best cuts off with honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as foreign minister, most Democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the electorate of their party, this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the electorate do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, Trump also considers 55 percent of the electorate to be not honest and not trustworthy throughout the country.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades on tour.
Of the six tested candidates, biden, Carson, and Bush are best cut off in honesty.
A majority view Sanders as being more honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the constituencies is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is raising close to Donald Trump in the country-wide survey
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half the support of voters in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically in hold
Republican voters continue to support Trump in a large number of countries, with 23% of support in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is good for demographic groups and that Trump is outnumbered by Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the surveys - it ends up with 19% support from Republicans, 32% support behind Trump.
The recent ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a carson rising last week, Trump found some side-brow for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peaks are measured only remotely, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find warm water.
A bath in North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea anymore: The water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean Sea, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east, it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Nearly two years after a student died during a difficult ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murders against five people are filed.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police reported.
Officials said he had been burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and had been repeatedly attacked while he was trying to go over a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi Delta PSI Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became out of power and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, to Google his symptoms, and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began hiding utensils and basically put the welfare of the brotherhood about that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to the head, torso and thighs with mute force.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the horrors of the Brotherhood. At least a student has died every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of harassment attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to make the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also bring it to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An interest rate increase is coming, and the houses will be awakening, returns on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history for the economy offers little guidance on the process.
A recession occurred within only 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressive nature of the Federal Reserve when it comes to increasing interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to raise interest rates but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement due to an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights, but still at a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical view of how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the presumption of interest-rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for assets to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increases, rather flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six last cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote it.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate recession.
It is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate increase of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent of the results of the Atlanta Fed for the third quarter.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question of whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken a year-round interest rate increase of the Fed, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many stratas and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the Futures trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all the growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with an increase in GDP and put pre-recession heights in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery," the report states.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest one the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
For bonds, the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/down occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on bonds fell immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The streets of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields coming closer together between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High interest-rate bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have widened and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
Generally speaking, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and becoming more attractive to local products.
Multinational companies with high debt are getting worse, as a rising dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have averaged 5 percentage points after each of the increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts will be a big problem.
Businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see gains through higher yields, even if experts differ in their opinion as to how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the transmitter for its "dump"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also addressed the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private stations do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "stupid" and increasingly no longer different from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "stupid" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, in which you're actually only imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC General Director rejected allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lay far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is an engagement for live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I really think it's important," he said.
At the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production which, during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, was under fire to launch commercial rivals.
The Tory-Deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC that was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in special BBC way".
He added that he wished the company "to find a hit from our own stable" when it started a series of entertainment next time.
However, he refused to exclude the appointment of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased most slowly in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November slowed expenditure
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have become ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total August expenditure presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 records with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMR sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that on-line sales increased three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the downturn in sales.
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers was around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that 5 pounds of expenditure was spent just over 1 £ online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca during the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia burdened the collapse partly of the huge Saudi bin-laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed on Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mourning, largely dressed in white, filled the route to pay for their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The procession of mourning passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beggars who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officers have already firmly promised that the Hadj to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group shouldn't have left the crane's arm when he was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the State Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group is co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-speaking service did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was banned from travelling abroad.
Early this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which plunged into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadj, which later takes place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Cranes, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not making up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family for decades and takes over major construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an absolute son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people were staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£ 174,000) be paid to the relatives of the murdered and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injuries receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly engaged in craftsmanship, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q will close sales outlets throughout the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can deal with a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
British workers are increasingly employed to do work in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the home market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe, who offer services at lowest prices, has now been obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and closing 60 sales outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women.
At the moment, the men are superior to the employees.
She said it was necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also reconstructed her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year profit and sales after the group had shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for Infidelity in Court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants were not guilty.
One of them had also been accused of abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Advocate General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had been crystallized that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to deposit in their functions for private purposes.
He counts the damage with around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial wrongdoing.
This fact exonerated the chairman of the Schöfensenat, judge Michaela Sanin.
Negotiating at a later date.
In order to throw away the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had at no time created a disadvantage of wealth.
The sportsmen would have charged only compensation for the expenses and the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 schillings (about 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we faced the situation: Do we continue the club or do we block it?", said one of the defendants, in the bread profession, large-scale auditors of the financial office.
He then decided with his colleague and fellow defendant to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have advanceed money, laid down our life insurance as security at the bank," he said.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
Furthermore, in the event of financial success, the payment of compensation for expenditure had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expenses incurred were paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, package and non-detail payments appeared, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defendants, said the second defendant.
Why the disbursements were not disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association had not been interested in the financial performance in detail, but only the freedom of debt was important, according to the answer.
When a functional investigation for abuse of office began in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
The defendants explained that this had been a setback.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the respondent knew no answer.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor would have put it in space.
The co-claimer had been informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damage reparation".
Why compensation for damages?, wanted to know judge and prosecutor.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree to this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he had never taken a cent of salary, he charged only miles of money and diets.
On diets he charged the club with 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years were not available to the defendants.
These had not been kept after an operating test, in which everything had been considered correct, they explained.
The second defendant was also responsible for kilometers of money.
All fixes had been made in cash, and he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard deletes another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the reduction of personnel for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The dashes at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not over.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment.
This will save $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will take place from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP employed around 302,000 people.
After that, the Hewlett-Packard stock yielded 2.3 percent.
The Group of printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently split up: for example, the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separated from the more future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and the other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand for its services from corporate customers has recently increased to the world's second largest PC manufacturer in Lenovo.
In the third quarter of business at the end of July, sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This reduced revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the change in the industry with a split-up and massive line-up.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman did not respond until late that customers are buying more smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more shops online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would, however, mainly be advocating rejection: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is finding 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian power owner Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents that 20 percent would do so.
29 percent were unable to decide.
Car: Second Press Day on the 66th IAA
The trade fair focuses on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: An outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water pitchers on the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred displaced refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
After that, a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water-thrower.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles to the officials.
The officials initially used continuous pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed toward the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas scream.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from breathing distress.
The Serbian police press spokespersons also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US note bank
The world observes when the US Note Bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time in almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half last week, who still felt that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good standard, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to rely on an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 a.m.
Deathguards at Delta State University left apologies
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "suffering" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it rude," announced authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency phone number around 10:00 on Monday morning
And said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but "no one will disturb", but he will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when policemen surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they had been married for about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 years old, and she was "destruction on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, walked into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in spring 2015, as stated on the university's website.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also said to have to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All of this certainly demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate conversion.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save alone with a better organisation.
150 of the 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the company's work.
The pilot union is currently negotiating.
Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and upgrades the low-cost Eurowings.
The objective of the realignment was to make a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in the future.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team of Chef Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spoher underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the conflict with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed after the strike that has been stopped by the court on Thursday.
That's what the union told us.
The topic of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results "in one year with a forecast record result" as soon as possible.
The trade union-airline conflict has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transition supply of the pilots, background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides that Lufthansa will be outsourced to Eurowings in the fight against competitive routes.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left defenseman to the crying and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He's going to move tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 years of age, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing cabin he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the mounting of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had erred.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I come back stronger."
In this regard, Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of PSV
With the European Championship in France, the British defenseman has an additional incentive to recover by June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno had a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard, because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was on the move in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a fouling game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're maybe David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the eco-label published by Dr. Seuss in 1971, decided.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the company's website SuperCamps, and continues: "lustious, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message that we have missed so far."
Everything beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book, represents instead a description of the content of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this would not be suspicious enough: Cameron's text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hopes to win a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is destroyed by the money-loving, tree-falling, thneed-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a hustling, murky being, "that speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A downing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any more immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Pushing Pakistan into the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test-series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, just a youthful-positive setting.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth excites from the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is, of course, difficult to analyze for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best picker.
A long time ago, one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own fate.
I hope he'll find another chance if he's going to run for Yorkshire.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not do so well, and that was not surprising to me; he is mainly a team man.
The question of how much time a test hitman gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation one can raise was that England first employed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hitman I highly value.
He's an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as before him, but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin bowler and receive four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hitman can't beat there, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a devil of Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred runs and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a backup spider, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the hit and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large numbers of backup spiders that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few wise additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in line with the previously said.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, isn't assigned to the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team creators do not set the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions will not be easy to make.
The Brexit deposit (Brexit = exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy gets into a mess by the year 2017
David Cameron's unforgettable renegotiation strategy to keep the UK in the EU is becoming more difficult every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who was violently disputing for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply ensnared in various crises, as the EU is now and not always on its own fault, are fully satisfied with Britain's self-established agenda with split concessions and disturbing changes in the Treaty, which they do not want most of the time.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also does not like it if it endangers social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to see a UK looking out inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she's been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggerated long endurances like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He's also a staggering force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It's hard to imagine that they're going to tear off a leg to help the selfie letters whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful comments, in the SNP style, while Great Britain's referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a pleite" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can easily remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunists, who made a name as an "EU-right-banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hooking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our large newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similar about them, but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum swirl, for Blair had set the principle of the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never gave him that away.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly hit on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs to waste time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's 80s strategy, a mistake back then and today.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips' traditional blue-colored trend and the wilder filters of Tory's small-Englandism can probably say yes to it.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and on TV this week, when the pathfinder fought in him, not admit that Corbyn's appointment of provoking John McDonnell as shadow chancell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father tried on television to be galloyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and delegates after all the reports at their conference on Monday evening.
Whatever the touchy bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news-disciplin remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of the social media, a breeding site of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe, which allows him to consider Labour's support in the referendum campaign to be a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that JC does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of meaning for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mistrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if all of this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
Claims of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the loadability of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "absolutely windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims were "building on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons called to develop a multi-criteria decision-making analysis (MCDA) to give their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director should have previously received from British American Tobago funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he is supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not delivered, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco management also took part in the meeting.
The research work of the group "is significant" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products to most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking."
Every other life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we continue to have the long-term impact to study.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion per year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in fiercely controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC General Director, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or sending programs, which would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee as part of his investigation of the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programmes that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program is financed, which could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this should be public television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC's debt to hunting for reviews is "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should go "to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of radio charges, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "informed, formed and entertained".
He said that little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on radio - and she should take an example of this change in "inform, inform and entertain" at the public television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the proms he said only a handful will be shown on television, and with commercial channels go into alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by noise waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by enabling motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Srekanth Chalasani, researcher at Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fad worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it uses ultrasound to the changed creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microblowers and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultra-sound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted human neurons susceptible to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Ads are ashamed of UK arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Waffen trade fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint tossing leg shackles!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but don't leave any trace!
The happy voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms trade fair is a warlike parody produced by Amnesty International to expose the British government's willingness to scrape arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Take DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the decoder of the DLR line, which turns into the picture of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with DLR ... Customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ pack of inbus keys, which is claimed to have "accessed to about a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists are working with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another one of the anti-arms trading posters greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that existed around the advertising for the arms fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic contentious corporate advertising, but "by bluing with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not being acted illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors wreak fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army about "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding aftereffects within the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
11 years ago, as a self-forgetting 19-year-old, I moved into a student home, still in faith in Beret's and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those whom I annoyed - and the numerous, long-sleeping complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's alluring to be black: people tell you where you're from, whether and where you've taken Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you're saying "no love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into beverage receptions, film night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and get their underwear straight.
On this point, don't think about starting at the university with a relationship.
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of sociality is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Clap: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back-mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies, less strange than welcoming the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friendships.
Your roommates feel obliged to entertain themselves and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat make people stand asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoyed, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balancedly than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb among the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my hall asked her neighbors if it mattered to them to put Drum & Bass a little bit quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly left her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she had her own music shattered, her door closed, and went to her three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student home?
Conversely, if you think you're a roommate for your future spouse, get to her, divorce her again, and then have to see her every day, and maybe experience how she's getting all the friends together?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his key in his unclosed room, the boundary between a Ulk and Mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good match is funny, but it only takes moments for him to become a boomerang.
By hiding you can give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never spoil anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but touch their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
Row houses for refugees, single parents, low-earners
The real estate operator Markus Gildner builds row houses in the central Franconian corner for people who don't have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing space, but also the single mother and the low-earner."
"I show you how to build today cheaply and well," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushed into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes that he knows how to quickly create cheap housing: He builds row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massy accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
In view of the flow of refugees, we need enough living space in the next few decades.
A completely banal, three-storey rowhouse is the solution.
Gildner: A rowhouse needs least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without property.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I did my project correctly.
It always makes the threatening Damocles heavy special construction and the parking order particularly complicated.
That's horrible.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a rowhouse need at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did residents react to their rowhouse project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you tighten the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It's true: We have had a boom in Germany over the past five years, but luxury apartments have been built, which can hardly be afforded by anyone.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-earner.
I show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially studied environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing on "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they get an error message that the "software update has failed".
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to wait either until the storm goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by slimming the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re-install them as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down half way and this could lead to a termination of the update.

You should also make sure that you have looked through our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only foreign exchange: Full attack
In the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 Nico Rosberg knows only one last sentence against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defenders and double champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve season races and also attacks the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current Smog in the city state will influence Singapore's Grand Prix is still unclear.
A dark bell has been hanging over the city for days, caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
Founded three months ago, the chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" has included another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is Entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the spa.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Merit 1. Class and citizen of honor of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" be seen as an expression of his commitment to the Kurstadt.
Quarterly office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift met under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses.
The Social Foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, now seniors and advice-seekers receive information on questions such as care insurance or the benefits of the health and care insurance funds.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have noticed that caregivers are often left alone.
There are infinity of questions.
"It is also rare that many of the cash benefits will not be used, because the complexity of insurance is scarcely understood," explained Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civil Hospital and for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as business manager Altenhilfe.
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis was taken in by boat for this purpose.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis complement themselves in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, care and reha.
"The Senior Care Center", said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city centre is that both managing directors see it particularly in demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the opening ceremony, the quarter office also dedicated itself to reconciliation at age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering."
This makes a big contribution to the social foundation that seniors can live as independently and as well as in their familiar environment as possible.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg had not yet been set against the third-party Würzburger Kickers due to the renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was set as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football Totopocals against the third leagueist FC Würzburger Kicker was now finally scheduled.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 p.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket presale now started.
It's something special for our team to play against a third-party.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg won the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional leagueist 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The title defender is SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as reported by the Künstlerhaus on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Lobkowitz Palace.
Parking Penalty: Tim Wise recruits police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
In the meantime, Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany, and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler has been involved.
According to his own statement, he wants to have spent 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, he has not done so.
In Bremer's city centre, meadow was cut just when he saw a parking guard exhibiting a deed outside for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
As a result, meadow stormed out of business, insulted the official, and threw the fine in front of her feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
With the city of Bremen one confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The case is still under examination," it says from the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not to show meadow.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the prosperity of marijuana plants.
For three days the authorities of Panama have been ripping out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23:45, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, according to the police, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to be allowed to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft service station.
On the grounds of the gas station there were also three people.
One of these men now screamed at the youth and hit him with his fist in the face.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and bled heavily out of the nose.
When his two friends rushed up and talked to the beater, he initially dropped off his victim.
The injured young man was now taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator persecuted the group with a car up to their apartment and protested several times there.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the beater and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the face and thighs of the victim were whipped in.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there's only a vague culprit's description.
One of the men was about six feet [1.8 m] tall.
The second racket should have been about 1.65 meters in size and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and notifiers to report under the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeinschaftsmeister Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsförderungin Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased.
Doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, are missing in many places in the country: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still standing by his successor with half a job in the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until that time investing 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when Felstehausen met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongol, years ago, who is currently completing their specialist training in the Verden hospital and who is also planning to enter the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was done, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees his own boss as soon as possible.
And so you agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the twofold family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior emergency doctor in Diepholz County and is volunteering in the DRK-Arbeit Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to settle as domestic doctors.
"The endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongol.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound research as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speech room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of 50000 euros from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," emphasizes Samtgemeinschaftmeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, about 2000 patients come into practice every quarter of Felstehausen, in the North German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another domestic medical practice.
A positive side effect of the practice taken by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller's speech will continue to look in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausen.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls smiling.
She feels a little pain after a long time.
"But we live on in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many more patients," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughter: "We have a 6000 square meter base."
"I've always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being raised at our southern border," said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl- Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
People's care and safety are in the foreground.
But it is clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "corridor" - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also like to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and, in some cases, to build corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case with the Minister of Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Liège.
The idea of corridors would be "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia would rather intensify border surveillance, especially on Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenin does not want to lock his borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government stated, the first refugees had already tried to pass the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in East Croatia during the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles in the Croatian Tovarnik have been hit by new refugees since then.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use.
In the coming days, his country will count on about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Moreover, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
However, the Belgrade government disputed that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "We can neither, nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to the media reports, at least in the early morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and in the course of the day more buses would be expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on their way all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away through Serbia.
"We heard Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue their journey to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to a slightly further west-west route to the shift of the past Balkan route of Turkey-Greece-Macedon-Serbia-Hungary already predicted by observers.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for border control
Croatia's Minister of Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been one of these since 2007, the EU partners have been giving the country a good witness in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgos crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two Horgos and Backi Breg border crossings remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on a local eyelet in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border was now closed.
It would not at present be very high numbers of refugees.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are registered.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area, even 20 years after the end of the Croatia war, there are still no mine fields cleared.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners had been sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hacker: Ukrainian pay 30 million dollars
Supranook is said to have been part of a circle of cybercriminals who have been accused of having been able to gain insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected is intended to make insider transactions on the financial markets.
According to the investigators, this speeded up a total of over 100 million dollars.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused persons in that case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizhilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lot of business.
People take care of their care, sometimes quick steps, sometimes cozyly bubbling.
They control the two stations of Mannheim's car salon at Paradeplatz.
City railways.
Pulsating, proud life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large panels each with the title "Before I die I want to die"....
The ecumenical hospice aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by as well as to volunteers.
While some passers-by can spontaneously grab the creed and "know my life", "read", "continue the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stay short, read, say sentences like "I'm not that far yet" and then go on.
On the margins, small discussions about the action develop itself, about life, how to deal with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I realize that the end of this world is coming for me at some point can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconian work Mannheim, which together with the Caritasverband is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action on the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, but it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still a matter of Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening up of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the first hour's volunteers.
Faced with the subject matter by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to get involved in the death aid.
When the ecumenical hospice aid sought volunteering, she immediately reported and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and Hospice Sankt Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences he has gained.
"I see the life of another wait, consider it precious and treasure the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free and non-confessional.
The financial support of the health insurance institutions and donations of relatives and associations enables training, training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years, training courses are offered to new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to recruit 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell to over 2.5 percent in the pre-market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.40 $ and 10.90 $ in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey of FactSet.
Despite the price increases, which averages 4.9% and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher increases in land transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be raised as of November.
The company said that it was still expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday employment plans were announced one day later than the rival UPS plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 per share, which twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, which has led to a stagnation of sales in its Express unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result of higher labour costs in freight operations fell.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,000.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Stratgen spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead interest for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening above them at an end of the decorated two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-time mission from Congress: to maximize US employment and to keep prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too narrow to predict it. On Thursday, it will be announced whether the US economy is ready to be weaned by the unprecedented incentive from the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that it is growing solid, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to strengthen this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds - and even by only a quarter of a point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the main thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself will insure the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect to wait for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless the stratoes mitigate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, she "must go a long way in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they won't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on good track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow sharpening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of Liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world got together at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May, when investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences affect the complex calculation when one should increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the reins during this session," said Stephen D. Olner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. Note Bank employee.
Now he predicts that it will wait for at least one month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Olner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically included in its decision-making process.
But in the final effect the Fed Monetary Authority has become the world's currency authority.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "close" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabel, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the fundamental economic data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an interest rate increase because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should go ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and crockery, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car division when you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The Garkitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is located near the cash desks and has various take-away options.
What is there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fill the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig-natural, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide alleys are suitable for shopping cars and forklifters.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash desk.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small Life Help for Refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unprofitable asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also loves to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German.
Of course, this is quite different from at a real school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to inform women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding. It does so with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Mother's milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
Municipal councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gym construction on the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the most recent municipal council meeting, the completed construction proposal was unanimously blessed without major discussions.
Previously, the body had decided, among other things, to apply for a "exceptional" building law, for "liberation" of the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special shape regarding roof construction.
Thus, a "sitting roof with non-middle first and roof cover" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was in turn about the roof inclination, which for energetic reasons - unlike required in the construction plan - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary, because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" in relation to the roof inclination - with the Bernrieder Gemeinderat usually operating more restrictively in the case of requests for liberation.
Turnhall construction, however, is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent for this," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project between the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are charged at costs.
Grants are expected from school and long-term sport promotion.
In the next step, the construction application for the 18 x 36-metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg draws to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is provided by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district, which Landratin Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, the Supervisory Board makes a decision on this, and it will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans are implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the more existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongau Hospital since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play on the question of who is to succeed, who agreed to take the lead with his team from October 1st, and to change to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "estimation" and a spread of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", Jochner-Weiß says.
Fischer is a specialist in pace makers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
For the next two years, fishermen with their team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to do so, will have both houses, until next year the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Landlord Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board, has seen rumors about the future use of the house owned by the German government as accommodation for asylum seekers.
"I exclude that." As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say, there are several considerations.
Currently there are a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatric home.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," says Fischer about the Quasi move to the Lech, which was taken up by the employees "positively and very understandingly".
There was no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (formerly 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure over the past decades, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and childbirth.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 h) at the Bergische HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for superiority.
In the last season, the Badeners at the BHC had a painful defeat and had something to do with it.
Hunt accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots.
During the arsenic on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
Just how the accident could happen was not clear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violent Crime
A suspect of crime has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to have killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as reported by prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be guilty of crime and led the investigators to the body's place of discovery.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve after a visit to a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first met with personal objects of the victim.
In the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing people, there was finally a suspicion of action against the 20-year-olds.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the prisoner, the authorities admitted to the police interrogation, killed the 16-year-olds and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the judge on Wednesday, the investigators burden him of death.
Inclusion of the more detailed circumstances of the case is intended to bring further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against apartment gap
The location on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overburdened in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would need to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association Association for Social Housing.
For comparison: This year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation.
Many then hit the housing market and row into the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study is also a major failure in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is putting an apartment deficit ahead of itself, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, about 770.000 housing units were missing in the agglomerations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flea on the housing market.
In the large cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "social housing" alliance proposes a restart.
The aim is to stimulate new incentives for social housing.
Thus, the basic tax could be waived and the basic tax on sponsored dwellings temporarily suspended.
Moreover, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start had already been called on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees are free: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
After Hungary is practically no longer a transit, there are more and more refugees choosing the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant transit via Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with Slovenia's neighbouring country on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the Serbian-Hungarian border has been closed, hundreds of refugees have moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border with Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV channel RTL.
Hungary had locked its border for refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws that entered into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures virtually unnecessary in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees on Serbia's border to the EU's neighbouring Croatia in the morning.
According to most media reports, they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxes to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this, the border line poses other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining cleaners are now expected to quickly create a safe passage.
After Hungary, however, hardly any more refugees come after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people attacked.
Shortly before the entry on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws consider the overcoming and damage of the border fence to be a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore started in Szeged, Hungary.
The convicted are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transitzons", almost all of which - 93 - were the most important transition of Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has the prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary anymore.
In Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be postponed there.
Just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began cleaning it up.
They collected the trash that tens of thousands of people left on the roadside in the past few weeks.
Lock gratings were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border area was rebuilt.
For the purpose of this conversion, no one wanted to express himself.
Following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria can reach only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, some 20,000 migrants were still resident in the country, according to government information.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train transport from there to Germany was stopped on the morning on the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove " Beached" across the border
"After the bridge festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when suddenly ten people with suitcases were standing at the entrance of the tent," says Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had a surprising stop on Sunday because of the flow of refugees from Austria, it was for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded ones, together with two other helpers and their cars, chauffed across the border into the near Passau.
Previously, we first tasted the unexpected guests with jause and drinks.
We said we'd take her by car to Passau.
"That was of course for us," says Stadler at the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"That was very nice for us," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had moved to Wels on Sunday evening from an ICE to a regional train to Passau to try over the border after the short-term announcement that the railway traffic was scheduled for Germany.
However, the regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival was together with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociable, a two-bridge race in the past – organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us another number of Zig thousands is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately to build structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly pushed the Hungarian government's attitude into the dark circle of National Socialism.
The sufferers of this policy are not just those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border regions.
The refugees will also have to realize that the "blessed land" they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to create in us decent conditions for protection seekers.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad looking for 35.000 winter quarters
Konrad has all his hands to do with the refugee shelter.
Christian Conrad is accustomed to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees, who had come to Austria on Monday, was also done without a big whirlwind, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master's achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations will need to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
Should it become more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," Konrad said.
He has already been talking to the national leaders.
These would have assured him that he would also be able to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
There will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn tomorrow, with the aim of clarifying how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Helping like us".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarterers must comply with a certain height of the towel holders or size of the overhead lights.
For a limited period of time, "notstandards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior's success in accommodation, Konrad explains with his experience.
I am an older gentleman, to whom one does not say the untruth without a doubt.
Belief is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Your own quarter search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are apparently problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
No opening of urban sports halls and other buildings, such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the Accommodation of Refugees, is planned for Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as one can currently accommodate those concerned without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For the emergency, however, further sites are to be checked for their fitness.
Criticism is expressed by the head of the city in the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts, too, have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Margins are not locked"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshuppmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday to further action in the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked down.
The continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not be available for now.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU Member States.
For Pühringer, that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try and work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquire some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni holder opened second business in the Arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Jutta Breit wanted to lay a dog.
This project had to temporarily delay the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade: Finally, she has now grown in the form of a further business location.
In the Furla-Shop opposite the store in which it sells bags, suitcases, shoes and robes of various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are starting at 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop is in operation.
Prior to that, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking about opening a store for a long time," Breit says.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna also had to do with the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has gotten wide from her mother into the cradle.
I am most pleased when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why such a woman gets caught up in the sight of a beautiful handbag, the specialist can't answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the supplier.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become U.S. President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for insurgents.
Whether he expresses himself in an anti-foreign state, is abominable to journalists, or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Presidential Office is strongly invoking the election campaign.
And cut off well.
This is also registered in the Pälzische Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some people in the 1200-inhabitant village are more than-seven corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
Callstadter Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they're kind of exciting, but they're not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style either," Simone Wendel says.
The native Kallstadter has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous spreesslings, which besides Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in Callstadt.
To the king of hearts he did not bring it there.
While there is respect for the family's performance, Trump also tends to believe that Trump is "a bit of a grandma", says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname that Callstadt had in the circle, "Die Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsche: the leaders, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the lords.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a site for gold tombs in the USA.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first land purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: her desire to return to her home for a long time failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He had not recorded Trump because he was once cut off without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folk Science, Roland Paul, had declared film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just like the poltert, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trump ("The Grandma was a born Trump, the Grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winegrower sees the American more distanced, "he's always so bubbling."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions like some Kallstadter that a family descendant Heinz donated something for the church organ on a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine this from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
You'll find it better if he doesn't like the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who had the saying at the time of his grandfather in the USA had been as he was, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"It's not my president," she says.
And, "The grapes will be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendels Film, for which Trump had been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematists, and also in the USA the interest awakens.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
From the Vice-President of the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but there has been no major shift in today's reviews.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull managed the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, sat in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise averaged 397,000 spectators in the five capitals, compared to today 339.000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind from last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 330.000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349.000 spectators at 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decided to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and struck easily The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 h) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 a.m. to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour plenty of 7,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
Nine will be confident that the decline in the quotas of The Chase Australia's second evening will eventually prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for millions of dollars that didn't manage to overwhelm the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have little knowledge of who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, where Sam Wood finally ends up in The Bachelor, was shrouded in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three out of two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips fixed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why she would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the spoiler who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both called fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought of it throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands on earth with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's house visit made her realize that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now completely set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a disagreement between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast to Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a range as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga conversion did at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a point and also to the running game after a breach of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up to his NFL debut.
Hayne quickly left the field after the Fumble and later told the Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a passport led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne poses for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested in a Siberian field of arms force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company was confiscated Yukos, and his democratic efforts were stopped.
The free voters demand the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW-Herbstklausur in Großwallstadt, leader of the party and political groups Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools when there are no new teachers according to the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from the collapse," said Aiwanger.
"If so, we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The country group of free voters meets in the Lower Franconian commune until Friday.
In fact, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voters' meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overlay the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavia wars in the nineties.
"That's not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the head of voters.
Rejected asylum seekers want to move the free voters as quickly as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We needed uniform standards of the federal states throughout the country."
"Bayern's moving off, not others."
"There we must become more capable of action."
But the national policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Middle plus" at 47 Gymnasia, in which an extension of the secondary level is tested from three to four years - in the result it takes nine years until the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The topic of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all the gymnasiums who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Stronger Wall Street helps Dax jump to the jumps
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long course of non-directional and nervous trade.
It was only in the afternoon that a firmer start of the US board provided a clear direction, which eventually transported the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points upwards.
The MDax average score achieved 0.54 percent on 19 552.88 points.
The technologically heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStox 50 as the leading index of the Eurozone increased by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
Solid profits were also recorded in London and Paris.
In the USA, the Dow Jones index last recorded around 1 percent in the plus.
Many Norwegians expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also for the major decline on the appointment exchanges on this Friday.
In the meantime, RWE's shares have been pushed to a record depth by the discussion about the loads from the nuclear exodus and have also left deep traces at Eon.
According to "spiegel", the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions.
The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered something, but ultimately they always lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" appeared from the weekend.
Therefore, investors were currently not given enough attention to the German chip builder.
Investments in future-looking Wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were lost than in the previous year, as reported by the Acea Industry Association at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of Autobauer Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen benefits were 1.26 percent expensive.
On the German pension market, the return on circulation of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index increased by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154,11 points.
The price of the euro fell to the last $1,1262 in the afternoon.
At midday, the European Central Bank had fixed the reference price at $1,1305 (1,1268) U.S. dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shot rubber at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an officer on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhaka said the police had used tear gas and then shot it in the air before they took back rubber shots.
20 cops and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, known to kill but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since the 10.
In August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centralized for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators have voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The property at the Elder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4,000 square meters in a direct neighborhood to the Old Post Youth Centre.
The preparations for this are under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and living.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it is said by the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property on the Ringstraße/Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it torn off.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the cottage settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor presented public plans for the project.
Some people are still worried - they fear the sale of their spare time
For months there had been negotiations, grumbles, debates and drawings behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home by the small sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans to the public for the first time on Monday evening at the Elder Council's Urban Development Committee.
This was originally on the non-public agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, which accused the investor and the administration of mystery, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management to the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all the questions yet," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately 10 to 12 million euros of the project has been in the debate for months.
Extensive reactions among seamen owners who had come to the meeting highlighted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seas and board member of the board of directors in the representation of the stakeholders, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant clot, which surpasses all other buildings".
In addition, like some other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase significantly by the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads so that it will be calculated," says Schulz
However, what is happening exactly on the well a hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First, we must have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were also variable.
Twin researchers at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about young people at its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins into the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare with Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and had also been in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said by the zoo.
The generation of newborn Gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian keeps her close to the body so far.
First the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for Cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide-ranging low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical vortex storm over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical whirlwind in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google starts doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that are intended to help thousands of refugees who have overpowered the European nations, fleeing from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe has been facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya torn off by the war.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for mildly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"Death data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have been conducted in people who are malignant with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity chirurgy - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment at approximately the same rate as 29.
Among those undergoing surgical surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved only at one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides, and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the "surgical" group", the authors found out.
Researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as it reflects itself in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, says the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass-Chirurgy group had lost more weight compared to the gas trekkomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), increased its BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), rather than a complete overcome of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obese people undergoing obesity surgery over the course of 15 years - compared to a group trying more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in patients with surgery, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with a BMI below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have solidly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love History Plays in Hunsrück
It is a subject which is currently increasingly relevant in beletistics: A young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets after years the swarm of her youth, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder's recently published novel "We are actually not like that".
Beyond the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, for it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to place a literary monument in her home town.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take up all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the homelands of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comparison in Oxford, which is devoted to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that although the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent response of the USA was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand disinfectant by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 who report poison control centers rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more and more often, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a sample of courage in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.
Young people are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
A few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning, especially in infants.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Emergency Call Centre at Kansas University Hospital, the Fox 4 station in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within the reach of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four syringes of perfumed hand disinfectant in school after strawberry, was brought to emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency drug who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah called her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain-trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfection towels and to store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained Methanol, a deadly solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by explaining antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and banished her from her room.
The police considered the destroyed plan to be "swallow" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in the event of an accident on the cross-span between Nordring and Herdenen.
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove on the crossroads towards the industrial district and too late observed that two preceding vehicles had stopped on the circuit.
As a result, he hit the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The accident vehicles were damaged by approximately 10,000 euros, and the police are informed.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.
Rumor kitchen: No disharmonie at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it around again.
Hearts will fight SFA because of Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be careful in January's new commitments that could destroy the Kader's unit.
Dons increase leadership through Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half of the year, Aberdeen gave a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths Plays Speech about Disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, which insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader of the tables.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title ritual with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said: "In Holland, do they not show any highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old company games, and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian chief swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat followed against ten men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way, but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
It's so important to get together now.
Warburton carefully with January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was finding some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and insists that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox cadre.
The ex-chef of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players coming in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with notice of withdrawal
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a annoying ankle for two years and has not made the exit from Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Fatherson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said and insists: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorruptible hube was reproved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Heart's player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the area of Roseburn in Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "I'm sure I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline has to end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to put the boys back on track," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his team from Aberdeen had to fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them an advantage of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half-time.
McInnes said, "There's no team that won everything in trophy games or leagues that never won the games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is rising.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 million to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunken Disturbed the Process
Since the security staff could not advise the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the troubles into custody.
A respiratory alcohol test in a 16-year-old resulted in 0.89 per milligrams.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
One 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and stayed in custody at first.
Why I'm going to be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be killed.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'm going to sit in a spectator gallery in the death room in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications available than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media stations from 12 to 5.
Whoever is selected will observe it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours of visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try and remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the publicity of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I've made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can look for them.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessarily.
Man forced after a wet police chase to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he got the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang out the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and sumptuous water, just a few meters away from a police officer who was trying "to persuade him gently to return to the shore."
Canning Vale's police were called to a house peace break event in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I don't come out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactics - "A good police officer negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the graves to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan humorous Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed to conduct a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a racing day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt-tupfer sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the spy accusations and did not want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I've been sitting there for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for her.
If they start thinking, I don't, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Prior to that, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable.
"eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
They apparently believe I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed in trying to capture me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moody, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still there today.
Should that cause me to believe it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved smoothly and may make people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they need to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really saddens me.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustration level has been built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeatn Master Black Caviar, called the racing-day-treatment-rule " ridiculous" after a pack of mud or tone had been applied to the horse legs, which was against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
It could have been like that all day ago.
But it had it that way on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but here we went too far," Moody said.
Man arrested for a driver's flight
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was supplied with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley-Autobahn.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood up to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driving flight and neglected assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy beats against rivals because of allegations to ring fights
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the Tackling of his players "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly disguised remark to the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" in the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team was confident, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It always appears - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we've made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has made the trend change for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "stressing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "difficult" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'll take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks making no points anything exciting?
For me, it's the plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening in the pre-final in the AAMI Park. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 Deposit according to drug charges
A man who may be threatened with a life-long punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a security deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at the Cafe Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a possible life-long penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole crowd and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to achieve his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two persons, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions of issuing his Australian and Serbian passport, reporting to the police daily, and holding to a 18:00–06:00 exit ban.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus tears apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening in the event of a three-car accident on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The cabin of the accident causer broke apart completely.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
A damage amounting to 122,000 euros occurred.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophile to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this fell asleep, enrolled in an online messaging service from which he received a series of improper pictures of children who had been sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "respective" web research that used terms for the search for improper pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, as it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "promised to be a police officer to scare them".
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare Pedophile.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment to have taken illegitimate pictures of children on June 14th last year, to have violated the conditions on January 25th of this year and not to have appeared in court for a hearing on March 24th of this year.
Defense official Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since one could argue that "no significant sexual element" should be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted a security deposit in this case, but was held in detention for hearing other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Lockers avoid small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being seized away from the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers caused people to increase on smaller border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side, a spokesman of the Federal Police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been attacked in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal politicians and forwarded for registration.
According to federal police figures, more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8:00 a.m. alone, about 700 people arrived in the state capital, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Excursion of tropical tower "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against stormböen in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Because of a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently streaming into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the outlet of the tropical tower "Henry", which has been drawn from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, even in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Boenseekreis, there are 60 to 90 kilometres of drilling until Thursday morning.
On Friday, therefore, the sun can be seen for a longer time.
The mass makes it: Every two years the car builders at the IAA show their innovations.
In 2015, the compact cars are particularly active, which currently sell particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment alone in August.
This is also reflected on the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is Opel Astra, which will be standing at the dealer's in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
He's at the heart of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive for this.
Opel offers an entry point below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 Euro.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
The Hessen also offers diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, Opel Astra is the only five-doorer.
The second variant will follow the combination in spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what is happening to new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and an emphatically sporty version of GT.
He comes into trade early next year, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
The offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbomotor and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm) according to manufacturer's specifications.
The sale start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-delegator laid their hands on the front part: Here the cooler grill was re-drawed and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and integrated Apple's CarPlay for the first time.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are included at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of human beings
The Federal Constitutional Court granted a right to an ex-husband of the Tegel Justice Centre, who had been housed in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they have been locked in too narrow rooms for only a few days (A.S.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
With this, an ex-haftling was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in the Berlin-Tegel Justice Centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer's information, was now on his feet again had been transferred to a larger cell.
Although his indictment for the unworthy terms of imprisonment against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Courts lifted the ruling of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for re-examination.
You see the man's dignity hurt.
Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of the period in question were decisive for compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, "a poorer of the legal protection of the personality would be feared".
The court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
Thus, they did not claim damages until April because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multi-use of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday also the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an unworthy accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
For three months, the applicant had been housed daily in a cell similar to that of Karlsruhe for 15 to 21 hours.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore constantly imprisoned for 23 hours, aggressiveness is increasing, even beatings are said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to youth shortages, 19 are scheduled to be abandoned in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is true of Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-chanc Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to absorb one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this and we can do it."
What is true of Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250000 apartments).
Dramatic is the lack of housing, but especially for affordable rental properties: Every year, 60000 to 80000 social flats fall out of the rental price, and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding from 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the Pestelle Institute's view: 80 000 social housings should be created annually and the federal government would have to invest in funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualifications to help them get started, says Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to recognize work.
While there used to be a ban on asylum seekers up to five years old, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation that limited asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, even because of the shortage of skilled workers, the view has been expressed by the majority that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
There is not yet a sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often mediated through personal contacts.
The creation of networks is therefore considered by Thränhardt of the Königsweg for labour integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "It is first very important for the uprooted parents to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handcuffs in different languages.
Should the need for women in education increase significantly through the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities, for example by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes for the class.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language.
There is no shortage in them, says Beate Stommers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception has been Berlin so far, inside senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student-willed refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or tolerance no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Admissions Act when they start studying.
The latter, in principle, do not receive a bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of the eligible persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, as of January 1, 2016, this span will be reduced to 15 months.
Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk, are also calling for this funding gap to be closed.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play an important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing state church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association, which professionally cares for the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
The representatives of Islam must therefore agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the State in many areas and allow him to have certain control options.
This also includes the willingness to take decisive action against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "immediately have their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will continue to be a topic of society as a whole in the future.
This will also require a change in the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants' organisations and non-white German stakeholders have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-racism Convention Germany commits to do in the coming years must become a reality if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man power and capacity, we can do that," he said to the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be handed out health cards at the same time as registration.
Benefits provided could later be taken into account with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalogue provided by the Asylum Admissions Act.
Otherwise, doctors make the most of the language barriers.
So far, Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated, migrants are being ill-informed about their diseases more than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, do interpreters have to be charged.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical facilities in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, with some of the other diseases, German doctors will be clear from their education, says Montgomery.
"Parasites infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, refugees may even be able to see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and a number of refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly carry out another examination.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with respiratory distress, dizziness, heart turf and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional deafness.
To prevent symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
Until now, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This has often led to misevaluations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leadership", the Circus Probst resorts to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to wash on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Leadership" - under this motto is the current manegen staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their daily lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes 27-year-old junior director.
"Manegencocktail mit Weltstadt-Flair", Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The programme of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to take the Cuban duo loose.
Easierness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
He Yuan doesn't have a problem.
Snakes fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and fascinates with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misconceptions in the attitude of circus animals are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not good, we are not good either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every petting unit.
The "four-legged artist", as they are lovingly called, will be read from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the mane either.
So the highest commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a walk for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to its performances.
On Sunday, the program will begin at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is a family day, the prices are reduced for the show at 5 p.m.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gives false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a stage at the beginning of the year.
He remained intact, but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also saddened by claims by opposition representatives that they had received anonymous threats of death and that they had been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with bush calls.
Last month they had built him up and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesperson of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but she has the title 'Death'," he said after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament will end, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
Later this year, HP will divide into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing company hardware and service business activities.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today, and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual turnover and "will be focused on providing previously unachieved, integrated technology solutions for companies," says a company statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP's action, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies are achieving better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Willyre
Wenger emphasized to Willshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Willshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain next summer.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during the previous season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League Clubs that have recorded most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a susceptible period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain military strength," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeatable even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope of leading the club to his first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has become even more desperate now than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of man’s year, with the aim of challenging culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of "healthy" friends, his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vivacious and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy luck.
The nice thing at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when playing football in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often hold back from completely exploring their feelings.
As one of the employees of telephone care told me:... "My listening role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I am getting along with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people at moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely new setting for the celebration of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö in the Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani reached a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, since they are not only seeking the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn’t a class game of Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s missed opportunities in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrative career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not achieved one or two more goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which on the weekend could hold a 2:2 dissent on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing storm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he walked in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before closing down at Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle row a heavy opponent.
But in addition to a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some mispasses and bad completions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, with no less than five attempts alone, was patched in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had hired him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he put his fellow players in the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shooting that was guided by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan thus reached his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had fished up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last champion league game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not enough."
Shut up in front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by one-door raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of his huge debt recovery plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, fights with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pushing demand and devastatingly affecting markets.
The issue of reference rights led Glencores to a rapid increase in the share price at trade on the early Wednesday morning at the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion sale of shares as part of the more comprehensive plans to eliminate about one third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 0.9 percent of the group.
Concerns regarding long-term curtailed growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other raw materials prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese president Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis' first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and answers President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xis will offer the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to deal constructively with areas of disagreement," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving on to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyber spying in China and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 from switching to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago ahead of the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight Spanish champions, three Cup winners, four Champions League champions, twice World Champions, twice European Champions, once World Champions - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left Barcelona FC and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the 2008 EM before departure from Barcelona.
"They told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we won't do anything," he says.
And that was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not come about.
And today the decisive man works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria’s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finale of the Champions League against the Bavaria across the entire distance on the lawn, the Reds turned out (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the Royal Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon faced the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then you do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shockedly, with insulted disbelief and cried out "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of The Martian's actor strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - as they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she's a nut beaten by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People was committed to the finalists Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights of the film; Damon replied that their director "in the end could give us something that we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social discussion.
After the teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement exerted influence throughout the country, forcing legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color-absorbing.
In February the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still Matter", (Alben still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of Fox-News-Personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climbers and operating aid Isaac Caliero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the big prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season, two men, Caliero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
The last task was to climb on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caliero completed this challenge more quickly three seconds, making him a winner.
Caliero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still under shock about winning the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
Just as suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why, although Britten was the first ever to finish the race course, he did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he's got any grudge about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the tigers are in the final place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildlife Square.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-Word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and made three runs possible.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine matches.
"I want to end strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bull, so I want to go into the game all the way in.
The designed tiger hit Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-time hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's turned the punchwood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (beat training), looked much better in the bull, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs in the back meet at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a color, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout before being replaced by the left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed over Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designed Rookie striker Miguel Sano, who entered a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th leading in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, the wall created an RBI double against the closing of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
The right hand, however, turned out Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmovable Phil Hughes for the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after having missed more than a month due to a back pain.
"Of course not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable than I was laying off and feeling that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first place, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers increased in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not score any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
COMMENTS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez exits due to an infringement of the litter students.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to shoulder distortion, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He has been missing since August 20 due to a rupture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees should be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people in it are then to be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She was expecting 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government presidency responsible for the first reception, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanover have also established emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I think that decisive reflection on military options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "grouping away".
Four years ago we were glad that the cup passed a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said in Germany's radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders after Germany.
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mikl- Leitner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF, no one is being sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl- Leitner said that there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not call specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan Route from Hungary.
Your goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
EU countries have not yet agreed on a common approach in the crisis.
EU Ministers of the Interior intend to take a new approach to the binding distribution of additional 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22).
In view of the strong refugeeandrang in Germany, the Federal Government wants to strengthen its support for the first reception and distribution of people.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, and on the late Tuesday evening Merkel announced almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who needed protection would also be.
But if you have no lead perspective, you can't stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to deal with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also lock the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU differently from Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent tugs from looking for an alternative route across Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
According to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants in Turkey have now made their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icepan of Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean is waving.
This includes researchers from observations of the "Cassini" space probe.
Thus, the moon slightly tumbles on its orbit around the ring planets.
Although this dome movement is small, yet too large for a solid heavenly body, it is stated in a message from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York State, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time, it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of Enceladus.
"Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south-east of Saturn's moon in 2006, which spew water vapor and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least in the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
1860 Munich must give up on the Offensivachteur Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association reported.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich's lion, the diagnosis means "hopefully four weeks of forced rest".
"It's hard for us, Rama's a very bad loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" newspaper, with a view to the possible commitment of an unrivalled professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove its ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brain shake next week.
On Thursday the Austrian national player is scheduled to take part in the running training.
Okotie had been hurt in the game near Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on his head.
In contrast to first fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to your slender line, it is often discouraged by them.
Mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy anyway: they contain B-vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its predecessor beta-carotene.
Whoever eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone doesn't say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste of course pure or sweet food.
A mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It eases the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
UPS, the US parcel service, is setting up up up up to 95000 grants for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company had already begun recruiting seasonal workers, announced UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are looking for.
As early as last year, UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 aid.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking precautions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013 late deliveries had brought the parcel services harsh criticism.
First hairstorm, then distinctive cold front
In the coming night, the hair will break into the valleys of the north side of the Alps, as Meteo Schweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night of Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with stormy strength through the hairy valleys.
After the end of the day on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British islands in a strong south-west current.
On the north side of the Alps breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday the hair dryer.
As a result, until Thursday morning the hair dryer blows into the hairdryer valleys with bees from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland also partly with more than 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can enter the adjacent middle country, and on the mountains even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer ensures summery temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stand on the south-eastern slope.
This is where rain stops until Thursday night.
In total, the next 48 hours south of the Alps will have to be expected partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer leaves the air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly thundery rain from west to east across Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decline significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south on the other hand, it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther-Platz in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honoured as "German theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority could often only live their faith in the hidden.
With the place becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At the time, he felt the city as a scapegoat of sin.
According to historians, his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Church of the Australian with his theses against the disposal trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (goldened) thorn crown is one of the main works Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colours and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means equivalent to "loving" pictures.
On the contrary, this can be quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-art selection from the many topics of the book of all books.
These are cycles dedicated to such topics as cross-roads, plagues, commandments, or father-in-laws.
With this, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publisher with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible sites selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" to the present day, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each one a sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lord's Order.
"There was an education with the pipe stick," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to work it up, perhaps to put up with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help art in a fast-lived time to restore importance: "The perception of image worlds is today influenced by advertising, and this is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed there.
Artists have a different desire and wonder to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in" the pictures, let them look at them, discover them and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
At the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation, Klaus Altepost stated on Tuesday that he was always a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings."
Old has not taken care to capture the Bible completely but has chosen the most important, even mysterious themes for him.
"This wasn't a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text just explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15 at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX train nears
Plans made, found place, companies commissioned, earthen hill modelled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX railway was thus already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hill pushed off, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform the Children's and Youth Committees about the approval in October.
"I hope something will happen this year," she said.
The work at the former indoor pool should then be started without "further commemorative pause".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear mark on the weekend.
Football responds to the rising situation in Germany and secures political support in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"No one can say that's nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must be of interest to everyone to get hold of this topic," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At an annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be at the Chancellor's Office next Wednesday, where I meet Minister of State, Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and would like to help.
However, the decisive course must be set by policy.
The German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesligists also support this programme.
On this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will carry the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's head of sports Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "of course".
"The refugee drama is everyone's concern, no one's allowed to look away."
"We football nationalists can, no, we must use our radiance, influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
For the EM qualification game against Hungary on this Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large joint venture of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations in their places have started their own projects is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have issued will be in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, the Association will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015", Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Executive Board loses an eye in the event of an accident
According to the CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, several reports have lost the left eye due to a fall in July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's home in the USA, he fell on a water glass after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reports the "week of the economy" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he's out of power, he's dragged out on the street -- that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and "full of work".
In an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Süddeutsche Zeitung) McDermott announced that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can happen this way."
"It's important to get up again when you fall down."
McLaren replacement pilot magnets out of combat ...
Magnussen twittered a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was thrown off the wheel.
Therefore, during the night race in Singapore on the weekend, he is no longer in demand as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Japan Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: pasture fields in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will also be missing in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky) by the football Bundesliga.
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
In view of the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his trunk at the giant position.
So he announced a change at the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of stem keeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weidenfeller will be used in all Europe-League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He will also be very likely to compete with the second game.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, says Mittelfelder Julian Weigl can be comprehensible: "That's why Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the Federal Government's will, Germany should be in the process of changing the car of technological pioneers.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt, Dobrindt spoke about a "new age of mobility" at the edge of the IAA car fair.
The automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wanted to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also met with representatives of industry at the IAA.
Among other things, the Ministry of Transport's strategy paper stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to "do not impose any additional liability risks" on the driver, the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany intends to work internationally to increase the maximum allowed speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km.
The Federal Government is also committed to a change in the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for men as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, and the driver becomes more and more passengers.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, undrived vehicles on public roads are "to be expected to be far after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany for 2025 at around EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of driver's personal data must be clarified clearly.
However, the German self-driving cars still see skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the test organisation Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, and 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, in the USA 33 percent.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the drive on all roads.
On the motorway, 15 percent of the traffic in transit could be seen in traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Well every fourth would not leave the car control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at Table Tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to pick up only in detail at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October after the present stand.
The final decision shall fall by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsoring date in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained single European champion Dimitry Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the set list in Ekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"That's what we should be orientating to," the world rankings five explained.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit with a hackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis was that of the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiter.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax-figure grouse cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
Highlights: Show window dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and so he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, it's real now," said Gaultier.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Bürgersteig on the Runway), which is to be seen in the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung (Art Hall of the Hypo-Culturstiftung) from 18 September, it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal and Paris, Canada.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said Roger Diederen, director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's work, which is hardly yet to be seen, which has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art for which much effort was spent: To freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist was specifically engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been transported to Munich.
Shortly before the opening of the October festival, there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, careful, fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football), he dressed his Teddy bra and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself the design of fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion show he could not have paid the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener lace as fashion niche
It used to be on the long stickers in and around plowing about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, continued to process them to blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Fashionspitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen peak fashion played a greater role, then was suppressed by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At first, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style periods, represents an increasing potential for orders.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Fashionspitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Spitt and Embroidery Industry Association.
Only they may bear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
There are almost no more private shops and the wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The bulk goods are now manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively over chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer von der Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been conducting a quality seal, which shows that we are producing environmentally and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Exterior of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
A field of tension is created between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball tip.
In some places, the machine embroiders small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I could not start with traditional Plauener Spitt".
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauener Spitt - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plauen and surrounding areas and who want a memorial.
With this, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen peak.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney dares to write a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about re-filming, but about a kind of continuation, which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic nanny.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already on record: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more widely to the world
The economy needs to open up to the outside in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group that was assigned to handle the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and promoting reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide a new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access, a relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOEs), private capital, and a revision of the resident notification system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up identifying sectors and companies which are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also facilitate controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened up.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and toddlers with full weight," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt says that at the end of the food chain, e.g. shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" should be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators have already been so heavily burdened with mercury that on the basis of the limit values still in force, about 50 percent of catches cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be inconvenient.
In turn, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this "trick" because smaller fish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximums.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which strongly enriches over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that "at the very least small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the event of unborn damage".
On its homepage, the Federal Environment Ministry, however, explains that "health risks to the general population cannot be expected".
Mercury is mainly due to the burning of coal into the environment.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants send out more than six tons of mercury per year to the Grüen-Bundestag member Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and far-reachingly exceeded", the "spiegel" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
