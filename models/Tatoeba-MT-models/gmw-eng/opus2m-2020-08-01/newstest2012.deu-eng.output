No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the request to abolish paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced in the context of an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regime, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned Prime Minister, rejected the second reading of the request for relief of sanctions for economic crimes.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of a alleged adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid and in December the appeal of the convicts is to be brought before the court.
Timoshenko himself calls the judgment a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the presumption of the court.
The request for the removal of Paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to the criminal code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region used to win it, in the elections Islamists, the question is only what - the moderate or the radical.
The National Council of Transition has become known to the law of habit of the Scharīʼa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft one hacks off his hand in short.
Women, too, should forget thoughts about emancipation as soon as possible, possibly arrogances of faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be endowed by the Qur'an from one another.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would be hardly imaginable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could even be helped by the disbelief dogs.
To their apologies may only serve the fact that NATO's air attacks were not directed by any general from America, but by God himself, whose power was praised after each successful hit.
The victors in Libya?
We only took part in a fire change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from military occupation of Libya.
That is why the Hitts are ridden - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
However, do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at a spot price without occupation?
Perhaps the West can at last boast of its selflessness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If not the Scharīa representatives will destroy them.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual countries published their GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all the records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, with France’s growth of 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded a higher growth than was originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France achieved a slight fall by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, the gross domestic product stagnated compared to the previous quarter, and according to Tsch. Statistisches Amt, thus confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter.
Preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data indicate that the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 percent between July and September compared with the previous quarter, which is in line with the analyst's expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds reached the value of 28.45%.
The return on the Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is getting worse.
In Germany, votes are voiced, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football team has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from home play and will not once again be missing in the European championship.
IHNED.cz pursued the ascent in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won pretty happy 1:0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has therefore redeemed their ticket for the football Em.
Also because of the precise defence game of the Czech team, they put more pressure on the Montenegriners only in the second half of the year.
The game's pick-up birds were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be mixed with the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that a premium of around 200 million will flow to the local football team.
From the first minutes, quite warring football was played.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the middle line.
During the second half of the season, the pressure of the home team remained out, and the large deposits in front of the prison room were successfully averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living sign.
Some hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the USA and Israel.
On Tuesday, a few hundred students from the University of Isfahan formed a lively sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to announce that they were willing to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran had not long since ceased its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
In Israel too, talk about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the case of an attack that was intended to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, the center in Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's target of attack.
The menu of a fat child: It does not breakfast and eats to the evening bread sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a human being to the environment in which he grows up and is the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had the evening bread on the day before, under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence" Pommes.
In families with Dickerchen, sports are also not one of the favourite jobs, but this also affects the majority of students today - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance and Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are key factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed suggested, for example, that five times a day, in the mode of eating breakfast-second breakfast-breakfast Vesper dinner - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet", is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for the evening bread
Experts point out that relative little things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families breakfast.
And - in most families everyone breakfasts alone.
The worst was the finding that is not breakfast at all in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of the healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that children who are overweight in the families consume much more often unhealthy pommes.
And almost everyone - without considering the weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are doing sports, only less than half of their parents do so - that is, only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own food plan from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flours, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"The great popularity of sweet lemonades is especially alarming," is highlighted in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, that is, the main dish, doughs won just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like the legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get correct information.
"In the case of the control group of the survey participants, which completed the questionnaire after the clarifying presentation "Adipositas is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a marked shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition", is quoted in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began giving priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed a lot of poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less nodules or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article on how stylists learn, I had tasted a little bit that it was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't know what was coming.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" is going.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the examination is, the more information and practical tasks are ahead.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with director Alena (no single man participates in the course), how to put on a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And that's what most of us are.
One has one too short neck, the other one too young figure without proper curves and another are chubby.
It's the stylist's thing to cast out wide shoulders visually, extend the neck or create the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman's type like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figuratively, without having too provocative effects.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so great that the skirt or pants really do not fit, at least one piece should be cut to size.
You won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt one feels much better than in one of the rod, which is always too high and slipping, in the waist, etc.
Boylike figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, boughs, applications, embroidery or raffling.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go thoroughly through my mind.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the assigned house assignment.
Each of the students was assigned a Celebrity, for which she is supposed to design suitable outfits - daywear and evening robe.
We should take into account the current look, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "put on" Miranda Kerr, who may know you from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I jubble, because this is much better for me personally than for example to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who in recent times has probably increased to the hundred kilos (well, that's a little exaggeration), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's not until Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday talk, filled with information about figures, was equally spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single garment in quite different ways.
The magic word is variable.
For example, you can wear a pullcoat as usual over the jeans, i.e. like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to screw up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks very different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most of the advice came to me: "First, you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we have to pause all these lessons, what you can combine with what you can and why, even when you often see different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he eventually photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speech ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different from in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
There you only need Madonna to see a not exactly brilliant singer from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this to be money out of control (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if one of us can be stylized, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to have a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to googlen after that, in order to be sure that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding Celebrity has increased or decreased again, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario laid our heart on us, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "constructing" the outfit.
In his work he must communicate primarily with the people he stylizes and he must be a stiff psychologist.
Appreciating people without offering themselves and standing to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and to complement pretty pieces, we can't clear the whole closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"At least you need to find some praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely, which must include a so-called "place bag".
So this is a bag that you can handle on the waist and carry all the necessary promises.
In addition to such clear things as shaving, deroller to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as nylon thread (so the stylist helps to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are rubbed in the back if it is too large (stick needles or other clamps are forbidden so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing gears.
But so that we can not only listen but also try something practically, we learned how to properly stick under shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is right, one can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We glueed and glued to us...
You can't even touch the shoes with the shear, so you don't damage them.
So you really have to do it skillfully.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was just the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me now - to devote itself to styling at a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride is achieved by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant faults to the routine ride to the early shift.
Although it has succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, what is useful if no one obviously wanted to do a little more.
Before he got to the shop tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already-agened series of games "need for speed" again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the matching passages are going, in which the main protagonist rises out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're used to at NFS, in the final effect, it's much different than you expected.
Sure - it's potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some excess errors that have been present in this series for more or less years.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of an incomprehensib laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into the story, whose main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very beautiful, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumny landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape works visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, unusual elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly limits the view.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be very careful not to be thrown away by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in succession.
Just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to pick up time (classical race against the stopwatch), then expect another personal duel with a single competitor.
And the police are also interfering, trying to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less passages in the game than you would expect (almost only three).
Finally, this is more to the advantage of the matter, because this element at least has no chance of getting bored - it is in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model runs into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not rip trees, on the other hand, it could not be said that it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations have to look around elsewhere.
But the local driving model will continue to be quite fair to an action-loaded race, although one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems appear only after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
A game of this kind can hardly be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you don't have virtually any impact on any object idea how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: In the tight overtaking or passing by oncoming cars, you "stir" the other car in some places only easy, but in other, almost identical situation you get into sluggish and spin wild pirouettes.
Or the cart will go straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, from annoyance it's all the time.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, you throw the game back at the last point of reference of the track.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
When you've exhausted them, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are more like an aid, in case something fails, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the restart helps, there is nothing else but to learn the critical section from the head.
Pronouncedly, the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to pass through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't pass through.
Elsewhere you always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are coming as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoyed in situations when you see that the opponent comes by in front of a playful car, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that it always comes close to your nose.
Contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same time and here again without regard to the time.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to catch up with one of these devils.
And if he's already in front of you, then he'll take a look at you, so you start driving your own car in Klump a few times.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly rents you the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, the game as a whole is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-loaded that you almost no longer know where one's head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "debt" it is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car in the course of the race.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the track, because just here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also the task mode (exhibitions) - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points to gain experience for one's own profile, which is common for the tasks (expressions) and history.
To get to the higher level of the driver, different items must be unlocked: starting from the car, up to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected at the same time to the Autolog online function, which compares, among other things, its own results with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (meineway), where you race in the dark on the rails for long (meine).
On the tacho, numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (meineway), but there is a subway coming from the rear and driving to scrap without compromise.
In our editorial team, we will probably be fighting for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoyed it is that at some exciting moments the frequency of the image is slowing down and sometimes this is quite dramatic.
However, this concerns in particular accidents involving a greater number of persons, where continuous FPS is no use at all.
The sound reproduction is O.K. and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In the effort to address a scale as broad as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "of every thing" arose - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be reduced by the mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have asserted with the breasttone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks somehow unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to put these mistakes in one's eyes with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenova:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance felt among the individual institutions."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth themselves and everyone to get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe" she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such an understandable and understandable way that she could have envyed some reader of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown up with such a role, but I must say that it struck everyone's breath, how well he took the matter.
"He is a human being who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and who, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is it, the European Union? Which number shall I call?", that is, as an important step towards the agreement and better legibility of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil hats quargel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Union was living in and planning to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago called it a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The government during the Presidency described it as a major negative which had severely damaged the Czech Republic’s image.
Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands to do.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only with the Presidency, but also with the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slender and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also reminds her of her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "understanding about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then it's grey accelerators, foreign words and trade jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, how can I know if one really thinks in Brussels about curding or round cucumbers and various large bananas or if someone really wants to ban us from the quargel?
It would also have liked to use the EU's land to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called upon to be Eurosceptics more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs into European institutions is all the more annoyed.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are your heads together - is this your V4 again?" and at the same time makes a pretty sour mine.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU will expect, in future, strong rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much real, as a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"First it was said that only the countries that want it and those who do not want it should work together quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds"" expected Ms. Vicenova.
In this respect, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues have to be discussed with an impact on the whole of the EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
IBM's innovator enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most precisely, then this would probably be the word "durability".
For the general public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its foundation a century has already passed.
The basis for this durability already laid their first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the trademark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was already published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a mutual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore successful for a whole century, because it remained true to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope we will do more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well thought-out system
Watson operated social care for his employees already in the 1930s - in the same way as the entrepreneur Baća in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had a paid holiday as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a well-designed remuneration system for best newcomers and dealers.
IBM's long-term relations with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the very beginning, the company was brilliant in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year is a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, and so far she has taken up the position of head of the company, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with the help of technologies," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "big blue" in the states of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars of stock exchange value (market capitalization) IBM was the second largest technology company (equivalent to Apple) this year, with Microsoft being overtaken for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all of the products and innovations hit the taste of today's customers - unhappy, for example, were the attempt with your own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally tied to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work to leave them again.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Success-Promising Technologies
IBM's profits involve a fifth of services, software and hardware each.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent share was most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-repellent assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future-looking technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis was fighting like a storm over the world for the first time.
IBM, too, remained loyal to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his amount of investment in the middle of the great global economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to have survived today’s crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's profits are growing steadily.
IBM's company log is: everything can be changed - only the values can't.
This flexible giant can also be expected to cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From cheese cutter to global flights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) had a rather complicated name at first - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM only took over the name in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone to the later society of IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous stech card watches for registration of the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him in the management of the company.
This leader then even put IBM's founders in the shadows - on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as already the name reveals, with the production and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to checkouts.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was sitting in the chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped lead NASA flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight from man to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to Lenovo Chinese company, but on the other hand bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of "smart planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. in order to improve the situation in transport and in urban administration.
In the trade sector IBM recently introduced the platform "Smarter Commerce" to help dealers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932 IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a world-level top research team dealing with the technology of voting recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful spouses:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is finished!
After her spouse Josef Rychtář (53) had become their lover of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina was still hoping that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she would not even have fallen into the dream of her husband.
After 30 days, when Iveta moved back and forth to Łíčany, Joseph immediately went with him.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcil with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with.
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not drive him out."
"But not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being, to whom I still have certain ties," Mrs. Rychtářová betrayed, but also said that she had already emotionally separated herself from him and was alone dependent on mutual propriety.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him, Joseph so far bears dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I have a very normal conversation, only the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I assume all responsibility.
The worst female fools: what about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female naughters, they shake out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines in which we allow some unsitting revue to happen again, allowing men to swap the blood in the veins?
Shopping
Is your husband asking them to be shopping addicts?
Do you have to buy at least one hader a week?
Do you like shopping and can it be a little more for promotions?
Then in your case it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite under control halfway.
But hand to heart, which woman does it take to look for a well-sitting outer garment only by a clothes store and not to try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told their husband - you'd better stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you probably also belong to the women who are actually possessed of what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is always sorry about her appearance.
The stronger sex is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scratch the tub - and this at least twice a week.
If you're with her partner, because he's once again trampling with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you've been shaking the kids, because the just-smoothed sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you are suffering from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
In the end, this inexorable purity mold can also harm mutual relations and, above all, family peace.
Bouncing
"Unspoiled gymnastics come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put the old socks on again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel is not simply thrown on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not be surprised that this brings him to the palm tree.
Of course that's not meant to be bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, the women might not need to meddle so much.
Clapped and Trach
Some women like to clap and kick, there is a suffocating or even slandering behind their backs or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to hoist through such topics, such as - who, who, who, who, how, and why.
Probably each of us women has a little harmless chatter and traffic in stock.
Hand to heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with clactrants of graved calibers, which are nothing and no one holy, which probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which are a significant danger to women's collectives in particular.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the 5-3 win of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina during the NHL's Monday game, making it again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match, was the benefit of the review of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that he had prophesied Giroux a big evening.
"Just before the game, I tell him that he succeeds in a Hattrick today."
I somehow felt that."
"Hin and again overcame such a feeling," Jágr explained, after Giroux had already achieved a goal on the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it to the successful Maxim Abbot between the circles.
A second before the end of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
More specifically, Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he scored his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," said Jágr.
"I wouldn't have imagined in life that at the end of my career I was playing with such an ice hockey player as he was."
"I'm so glad."
"I cut my game at me."
"All those years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the spear turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made play for the drama - due to the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who came out of a prison shot, came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one successful.
"Excellently, Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) pulled to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the final hits of the game from his point of view.
This victory led Philadelphia to the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the match against Buffalo and retired in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experience Beck, the Candiens also paid an unlost lead in the Penalty shoot 2:3.
Tomáš Platanec was not able to change one of the prisons.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defense players to the finish.
"That's bad."
"We only played the match with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, so we have to get done," said Jacques Martin.
"At each change one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec rejected thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
Five different shooters were involved in the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorised public travel agencies in the ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold only travel to the socialist eastern blocklands, and in the West only were allowed to choose.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the eastern block (i.e. also the Czechoslovakian) to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he would need a so-called letter of invitation, otherwise individual trips would not be possible.
Even then the travel agencies also offered travel to the west, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintance" in the travel agency.
This is the same thing that had not yet been done.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for an exit to the West - was only granted "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Thus, most Czechs spent their vacation in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dasschen - a habit that continues to this day.
The same revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox of which one is no longer aware today is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday destination in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which caused a tremendous wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time, the Czechoslovakians could not get enough of their travels to the West, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a guest house at that time.
A typical feature on travel abroad from the Czech Republic was a box with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus average salaries increased, resulting in a further important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997 travel agencies began to prepare regularly trips through charter flights, which, thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts, made them incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, with the exception of the United States, the Czechs had already had currencyless payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-autumn" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in far-away sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flyn directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely led our country to join the advanced countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita for a single holiday stay including the cost at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new Chairman - again a Patt threatens.
For almost five months, the Czech football team has not held a chair, threatening that Ivan Hašek's successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary Annual General Meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is still no agreement on what electoral order should be chosen.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, inviting his colleagues to reach agreement and a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old querels between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was evident in stone and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the Volkshaus in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any results and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the full assembly - only the constitutional representatives or the functionaries equipped with authority.
At least partial agreement was reached on this one point, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion is that a proxy-based representation is not acceptable.
However, the dispute over the electoral order continues.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity into the matter, at which meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Although the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how to do in the 3rd round to avoid a Patt situation?
"The issue of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model has to be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, representing the professional football in management.
According to the constitutional model, in the third round the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is said to be willing to accept the compromise that wins the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least one third of the majority of the votes in this percentage vote.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which it is best not to bend the electoral order, but to elect according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, even though it is apparent that the constitutional electoral order of all candidates is most likely to be met by Pelta.
"My wish is that most of it be chosen according to the statutes."
"So that there are no foolish variations of replacement, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time candidates and defined himself in his opinions primarily against Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football club today would certainly contribute to calming the moods."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reticent.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is incontrovertible."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "righten" the rules for their own purposes."
"That's why a further blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the common sense will ultimately prevail," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualification game at all.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica, was unable to start in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so it was feverish to look for a replacement variant, such as bringing a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage replay.
At the end of the day, the meeting at ministerial level is certainly crucial, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country's largest sports association to reach an agreement.
It is a lot at stake: state grants, the confidentiality of Czech football, and also the upcoming Annual General Meeting of ČSTV, which is intended to show the Czech sport the new direction according to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is in the fight for the chairman's position because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football team before the extraordinary general meeting could have made up a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Republic Football Association (FAČR), he would not have taken the lead in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the choice."
"But in the current situation, it failed to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the position of the chairman only one year, thus until 2013, until the date of the ordinary Annual General Meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
"I spoke personally to some people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he argued.
Most of all, Paclík is said to disturb Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner County Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes on general meetings.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable for Pelta to have the chairman's position.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved, and in Czech football it didn't go any further."
"The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
It also suggests that Pelta's name fell in connection with telephone stations for investigation in a corruption affair some time ago, but that Pelta came out of it without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the (tw) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already sees a little bit more relaxed.
Should Paclík win in the Thursday election, however, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate also thinks - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the Annual General Meeting in October, who ended up with a Fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had caused it to look after him for replacing Dagmar Damková behind the appointment of the Arbitration Commission with Lućěk Macela.
Paclík himself claims to feel the role of the president of the association grew.
He has been the head of Pilsen since last summer, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this one."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which can be found in current situations," said Paclík, who does not make any sense of antipathy against the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský, for example.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would praise the political leaders for the fact that more money flows from the lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argumentation, then they must also say straight and clear where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the chairperson of the FAČR must be "over-partial".
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense for me to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would exclude a pat situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency office, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make himself strong in the event of his election for the FAČR to receive new statutes that will in future rule out disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday's negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely get out of control in the event of a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had promised to focus on the national team and the recovery of financial resources in the event of his election before the unrealised election in September.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last Annual General Meeting, so the two-month break would help him to defend and introduce his ideas about the management of football in a wider context.
"People at all levels dedicate themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time the association was led by someone, says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the Annual General Meeting approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman already since September," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Civil Society that he used as a tool for the delegates.
"If I become chairman, then I accept it personally and am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to demarcate himself against his counterparts.
He had already announced that he could introduce himself to a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized because of his legal education and he well knows that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread to Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were depressing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many doubt his true character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he said already in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes, to the national team.
And this was supposed to be Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the downhills of the corruption scandal from last year."
"After that, I would fall for negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean human cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarise myself with the work content of all the employees," he said, heading towards Strahov, where, because of the long anarchy, nervousness is understandable.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really should be the only disputed point as you choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and he only wins it back when he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former vice-president Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly miss many people in the association's mood.
In fact, Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, increase money in football, and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Hašek had begun.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, the national selection, professional football, and performance football for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that football can move forward with miles in every segment."
Many would not be delighted about this because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it had been considered that it would no longer be possible to register at all.
"It's known to me that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who do not undisputedly throw bumps between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people told me, however, that I should not give up, because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't waste," he said.
It is also alleged that he is motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work and I don't want to throw it away."
"Processes have been started that will only come into effect in a few years and I would hate to see them stop," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen."
I guess you can blame some, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is good and not just the chosen," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether one should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then each ascended into the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravians," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the president's function, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of fifty million crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "from the outset he is disqualified to help Czech football to have new confidence", he considers the second rival Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he did excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has begun, and he would obviously not change the staffing in the Commissions in principle."
He would certainly not want to bow things down to his favor," says Rajchl of his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbasin in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or hike rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip over the past one and a half years, one of her luggage should not be missing: her bathing suit.
Situated on the water, she looked high in artistically designed domes, she swam in marble-putten waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and marveled at the acribally restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she quickly included it in her notebook - including knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explores architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmeren in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore-Betonbauten" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
Annoyance is that swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorinated tanks, while joggers can breathe in the captivating scent of spruce forests or listen to happy bird faggots in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based fellow.
"So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in bathrooms is therefore so big that all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have put forth some effort, swimming halls can be a real eye-tasting: "A floor has a surface of water in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumpboards.
The small-format image book "Badefreuden" reveals on 190 pages interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all it is a pleasure to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in an ancient Karsthöhle ( cave pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water and located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While you have an eye on the whole city from the Zurich attic, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the drifting on the ski slopes.
The most exceptional pool design awaits bath guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo that is just landed in the Alps.
From three up open bowls it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder get the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it smells so much like heating oil, which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen-carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to one of the skin as soon as you slide into the basin - a spa experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful seaside resorts: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sun bath in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder looked through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has countered the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three stages of construction have already passed this bath; one can discover not only neo-Romanic elements that originate from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the Iris Meder - not only because it originally originates from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge different styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only minor.
Agro- Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business light up
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business of agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the group then wants to cause consequences.
Hamburg -
The case is clear to the Germans: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize, according to a study.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it tightens the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity markets are raising prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank's chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the soccer companies have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "worthy to put the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit will be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Board of Management of Deutsche Bank - and the recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the Bank's head will then report what consequences it will face.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be achieved, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann based on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Bets on rising prices of food show particularly dramatically how careless banks today damage the general good."
Ackermann is now the first banking lobbyist to be particularly required.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio in which money is used for bets on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann's concern about hungry people or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the group wants to give a perfect picture from the office a few months before his departure.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Board will not change to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to shave himself - that would eventually have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute forsa interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
As a result, only 11 percent believe that Deutsche Bank is legitimate in offering investments that are wagered at food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: each second would, according to the survey, terminate all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent reported thinking about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Wien
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels was awarded prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and lost.
Now he's being re-opened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture warms up by clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwazer is a striking and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
At the time, Schwazers Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made it known to the architect that he was also building a pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus semi-trailer construction in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
After the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden, the pavilion was set up at the Vienna Südbahnhof, rebuilt and opened a 20th-century museum in 1962 - the "20s Haus" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable for spatial and technical purposes as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, now called "21er Haus" and will be used in future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a fortune in every respect.
The new beginning, Agnes Husslein-Arco, became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a PhD historian with a remarkable career in youth as an ice-cream runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the reconstruction of politicians and monumentists, obtained public funds and private sponsors and defined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the work of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the performance Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession was sensitively rebuilt and expanded in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwazer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "very important place" for him, where he "almost every weekend" looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in his relocation to Vienna and his re-use of generosity and ease.
There were far greater problems in the current renovation: The building was "an energy slumber," says Krishanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade have been replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass has been used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two floors provided space for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light cocks-pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema room is even the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
"Often a material had to be found, which is good and cheap, and which is also pleasing to the Monument Protection Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and renovations, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "that came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture "always stands in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban luck: around the Swiss garden is just the completely new planned " Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential houses.
And another chance might come up: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter-crisis package in millions of height
The train has run out of a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn will issue more than 70 million euros this year.
The "Image" newspaper reported in advance, drawing on a group-in-house crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were planned.
This should achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow disposal on railways and ascents to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary operating routes.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Bahn-chef Rüdiger Grube warned against train failures and delays even this winter.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to have axles from ICE trains examined much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break in the Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays million fines in the USA
After the tumult of Chef Josef Ackermann, new disembarkation comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank at home, the industry giants are now still picking up its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the pleite of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The NCUA financial market regulator calls on a number of large banks to have led cooperative banks into false promises to purchase financial products; they would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and pulled the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The Bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps into pleas to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to replace the billion-severe damage caused.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
In the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs, the regulator had also preoccupied themselves with other large banks.
The mortgages in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the U.S. Property Bubble burst in 2007, this became a liability to a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank tipped Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events have been a few years ago, banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous complaints to obtain reparation or to prosecute errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of action.
It calls for 18 major international banks to have over-prepared two U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint from FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses" without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as persistent and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett rises at IBM with 10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IBM IT company.
Since March, he has been buying up shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he is not investing in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly predicted.
But now he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a knight strike in the financial world.
Consequently, IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett now revealed to CNBC in the U.S. economics station that he had bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM had not even known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which, even in the economic crisis, had made good profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said on the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railway, for example, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
In addition to around 80 own subsidiaries, its holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a whole range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with wise investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment became known, the IBM share increased by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market and is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The Threat Is Grabable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zell", Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that now relives.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news will react with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, a long dead-believed ghost returns: Since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been questioned.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Does bloody ideology come back to life?" entitled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
In particular, the Turkish community of Germany responded: on the weekend with a guard guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate, it remembered the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought of a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colours, the together was staged - as a story of success.
Like an ear fig, there is the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," says Ahmet Külahci's column title.
He stressed that people had been murdered, who had paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the conduct of the police and their later detention success is discussed.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not already think much more about looking for suspects in right-wing extremeist circles.
At least one of them shows up to drastic means: "If there is still sluggish here, there is nothing left to the migrants but self-defense and arms".
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The quality of the Enlightenment and fairness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, illustrated the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to judicial violence.
The attacks, however, heightened the economic sentiment on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was at the time particularly criticized after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the burning of Solingen, he sent a condolences chart to the Turkish President, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral ceremony in Cologne. Kinkel then added to his speech how many charges the Turkishs paid.
In fact, the value of a person is calculated according to the level of his tax charges.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German doors has been in the local rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and re-evaluation of right-wing terrorism in Germany, it is necessary to open words this time.
The scandalal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been sleeping since then from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber wouldn't have thought that way.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and random career step.
Axel Weber was delighted to hear that Switzerland praised their beauty and the UBS for their newly gained solidity and made kind comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and covered some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker famous not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS has also been regarded as being a member of the Board of Directors - and everyone has asked: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber is allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he took over the Chairman of the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013 as announced by the Bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, that's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, he is an economic professor and a banker and would certainly have needed a time to work out.
With one stroke he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
For the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, has been sleeping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
The UBS had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the silent and solid, but also buffed Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed with 1.6 trillion dollars more money from customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, it was advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made sense.
The former banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "My students always put UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, they ask themselves, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was extremely wrong.
In 2007 it became apparent for the first time that something was going wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was regarded as a highly intellectual banker and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was suspected of why he had gone.
The Bank's investment segment had been filled with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
In order to study this, UBS announced a capital increase of saying and writing 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, however, which some until recently would have rubbed their noses: an opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so silent that one didn't even know his name.
But that was just the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to report new billion losses, President Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: The UBS faced the collapse due to its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be saved from the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation issued six billion francs for a forced changeover bond that enabled it to become co-owner of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the total UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see Figure).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data of potential customers who might have withdrawn taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, along with a penalty deposit.
In this way, UBS has been more or less open to help with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to misspectulations and asset management through assistance for tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just when you thought that now the UBS is going to get it back again, this immoral dealer story follows: A single dealer is paying 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it will obviously be: risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"The Adoboli case has made it clear that there has been too little change in risk control," says Martin Janssen, Economic and Financial Professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: not too big a risk, for security of money - even outside the Alps the world could collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse, to the elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are marble-dressed, there are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has pushed both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrays how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS has become far too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes would have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the fishing axes."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking, which changed the UBS, that gave it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided on the largest rescue action in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hössig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, the politicians approved to save the large bank in front of the bankruptcy.
How could it be?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you will see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and grew ever further.
In doing so, the two different precursor banks of UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came cheaply to a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 CEO of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked from the bank teaching up to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Annoyance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings, on which the head of the group Wuffli repeatedly issues the same slogan: Goldman Sachs is coming from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been taken.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played at the top.
However, business consultants who were assigned highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS entered an adventure that cost it almost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Also, when other banks have long sought the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was standing in flames, UBS bought it there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep down.
One manager after another had to go as the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a sluggish seat and are still rolling today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It has to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all its business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated itself from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to run the UBS's business permanently, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti intends to return the investment bank to the position in the mid-1990s.
3500 jobs he deletes.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask himself now.
Publicly, he only says so far that he will first look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US banks
The threat of recession in Europe has taken courage on the part of US investors for a weekly start.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remained unbeatable.
Threatened industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief of the changes in government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell across from the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been half full of gold in the past week, not half empty - but now the problems were re-introduced, said Mark Luzini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales registers.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values recorded 0.6 percent at 12.078 points for the trade closure.
In the course of trade, the market barometer commuted between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the technology market Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax agreed with a minimum of 1.2 percent for 5985 counts.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is facing the end of the upturn.
In September, enterprises produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
The US investors were skeptical about this: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to escape from recession as soon as possible, and there are further signs of the weakness of the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only: Whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment over ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and had it recorded almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to its own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The stock price of Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's equity notes were significantly higher than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house silvers almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and cancels 6,6 billion dollars for that.
With the net profit from the business, the institution intends to boost its capital ratio and thus meet more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 type 777 long-distance machines on Sunday and measured the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Including options to 20 other machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged.
On Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares in 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed crows are considered "problem birds": But from the cities, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out, say experts.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: Crowds have been part of the city's picture for centuries, but in many municipalities there are local complaints about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Saatkrähen were no longer able to get out of the cities, experts said at the first Krähensymposium in the East Frisian emptiness.
There, professionals from all over the federal territory provided possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also brought the problems in cities back to the rural escape of the particularly protected seeds: chemical use in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crowds are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project on the mass killing of crows in the district had taken care of negative headlines.
Critics had called the catch of the animals in bird traps and the killing with batons particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the grumbling, doesn't do anything," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Empty.
Nesting with water or falling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dissipate, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
It is only possible to make an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the problem could not be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Empty.
It can be thought that a combination of grumbling animals from sensitive residential areas and locks to relocate them to other places.
On the other hand, "Infoboards instead of chain saws" was the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different handling with the animals: "We can finally best endure a pickel in the face."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberg Krähen-Lehrpfad, where he was informed about the life of the highly intelligent seed pubs.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication that have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seeds use not only tools to get a treat, but also make their own tools.
Behavioural researchers from Cambridge University recently tested four seeds, as far as the intelligence of the birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they have to crash a scaffold to get to a moth larvae.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to let the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the plumbing crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wires for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they fished the bucket at the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seeds did this at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at EM 2012
The Bosnia and the Turks' hopes for a coup were not met.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at EM 2012.
In the playoffs, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the European Championship 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Accompanied by the double-success superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53th), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in a row perfect after the 0:0 from the play.
The Czech made a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off replay at outsiders Montenegro, after the replay (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
No more burning Croatia in 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored further results for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a changed trademeter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a start to measure.
Ronaldo chased a free shot of about 30 meters to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his far-shooting qualities and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City placed a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Juracek meets for the Czech Republic
After that, the focus was on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trademeter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which certainly changed Misimovic.
But after the break, the Vice-European champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European champion went to the EM for the fifth time in a row.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to survive a startling second.
Endemann Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities if the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic just shot in the 40th minute out of the rotation of the penalty room border just by the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross- countryman had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the stormer of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey has missed Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not reach 0:0.
While national trainer Guus Hidink therefore has to take his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can enjoy their fourth participation in an EM final round.
31,000 viewers in the Maksimir Stadium had almost caught a dream start from the Turks.
In the seventh minute Selcuk Inan met only the post with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to sink the pick-up in the gate.
However, after the startling season, Croatia became more and more inspected.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga-Legionaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni driving to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4–0 success in the play, in the 32nd minute lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was similar for the guests.
Ireland was at the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible leadership.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was ready.
After a bad defense from Endemann Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to the 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," Co-Chair Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beautifulness and Horror. A History of World War I, told in 19 fates" begins with a long list of main people that goes to your heart.
Here is a tip how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund’s romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and are robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe as irrelevant "a work of anti-story".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, speedy reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautifulness and horror" is almost the war experience of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulances and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others are extinguishing.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of positions on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" travels with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on bee baskets, one celebrating Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsfliegen are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane named Katrina, who smells like Kordit.
Imagine, you're a woman who's home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is even waged.
"Fucking facts," says Englund, "were encouraged with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or touching, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the gathering of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replace, replace everywhere."
"Replaced coffee, false aluminium, false eraser gum, paper associations, wood buttons."
He tells more about the substitute dinner in Germany.
He describes "flesh made of pressed rice and baked in hammuff fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were covered with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are of honor and braveness.
An American recognizes his own desire for wildness and says about the war: "One feels that, despite all that was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and so to do, as does such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own fortified and beaten shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"When you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new forms of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century": "the word, walled and ideologically convinced mass murderers, slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way, and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroinism.
Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a prostituent in order to escape the frontal service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in trade with Gonoccok-Eiter, for soldiers bought and lurked on their genitals, hoping to get into the hospital like that," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate put him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englund's poetry is smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way in which the war " unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about the First World War were mostly falsified as Paul Fußell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's "No New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional fame hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it here anymore.
But it's like with his book he took this page away from the nose with the main people and lit us with a match.
After an early mistake, a minutely planned breach
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time hardly any people are in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police president Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the deed and gave the householders a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the Protestants from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - anti-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute," said someone who was familiar with the orders, which said a declaration as "exercise".
"The few police involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then they moved back when hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that during the day many people enter and leave the park, almost like comrades, so that 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park stayed," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were available before departure at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded news, which flowed from the speakers, seemed to intimidate many Protestants.
When the public officials got into the park in their light blue wind jackets, many Protestants simply packed their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 p.m. no tents would be touched to give the Protestant time to pack their goods together.
Other teams of officials have been seen gathering in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from monitoring the police operations in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials had been very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the big mess of personal things of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleansing, which had stopped what had been left behind.
Some Protestants who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of Protestants moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter tied together to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The room was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, as he said, due to "unfair manners and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of the Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not manage the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials were waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricaden was built on Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these police sites the area around Zuccotti Park expanded steadily.
In one place it was observed how several officials, many of them with shields, drove people out.
About 28 persons were located in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 p.m., a Protestant jumped south of Pine Street onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
At the end, an official and a Protestant came to the hospital.
Trade union of caretakers will bring action against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school teachers who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, since the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The action is probably the last opportunity left open to the trade union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy school assistants, care coordinators and other staff members who were among the worst paid workers in the city and who had lost their jobs in a check train on 7 October, described the trade union leader as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups last year to close the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was approved in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that in the budget, nothing specified that staff would be released from school.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the file of the lawsuit is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The action will be brought by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as accused and eight dismissed workers will count as all coloured or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city did not present the complaint, so their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union has concentrated on the number of redundancies at schools in the city's poor districts to support a complaint for inequality. It claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfinanced.
She explains that, while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the schools of Upper East Side or TriBeC, 17 school assistants in the district of 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 helpers were released to the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of dubious parents who can organize donations to capture budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost as the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poverty school registration.
The trade union also complains that the heads of the high schools were led astray by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not transferred," says the draft.
Mission ended, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
In the end, it seems that Republicans and democrats in Washington are already talking about the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee will adopt a resolution under the responsibility of Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simple in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House disputed the choice of words of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law fell through in the Senate. Furthermore, the board overcame a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
This led the U.S. mission to a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was charged enough to criticize Obama's approach in the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the International Relations Committee "engratulates the people of Libya for their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "blesses the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive the full support of the foreign relations body, or will they split the legislators as the June law did?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every Congress legislative period of Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or in another area which is currently taking place in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their changes to the vote, although they have often tried it enough.
This amendment is only one out of 68 constitutional changes which have been presented to this Congress and which cover a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to Congress and to the Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the budgetary change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners with the Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "contained" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change to the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) intends to remove the limit to two terms of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage among the same sexes is, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags, an ever-increasing template.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As zealous as the members suggest changes, they are moving even faster than they have in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to the early 1990s, in which members regularly propose more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last change to be added - the 27. - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact already proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Affected, but not defeated", says Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot at her in Tucson from a near distance during an election event, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening. She sang alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that to return to Congress.
When she appeared in the ABC "20/20" together with Diane Sawyer, she came up with words and needed help walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divided its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she came back to Congress surprisingly to give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "silence".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one hour "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the attack of January 8th.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with bare shaved head and a long scarf above the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A fuck with the lip.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see how the congressman sings together with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12th, he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is necessarily treated medically while he is waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Heart, heart, heart."
During his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"Well, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will survive, and you will recover, and you will return stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedo stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The scratches of conflicting impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are filled with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if you were suffering people in uniform form.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support the one is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in disputes with the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the anger, which has hit the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result, discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "violent, violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over a raised state post in Washington after his return.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtly asking whether he was able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you must resist the negative impressions," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Forces find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is facing the growing pressure to get hard in the event of rape
This week an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are charged with non-intervention in a rape in the military court.
Should it not be possible, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he would accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells started," said Lyman.
But the Texan woman wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, well, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they have filed against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is allowed in court.
The action claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and infringing the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, an attorney from Washington, D.C., the action included 17 applicants, who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and the military failed to determine, condemn or provide a reasonable case-law according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retribution of those? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the complainants putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has submitted an application to reject the complaint.
The files of the Court of Justice, which are available Newsweek, show in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by current or previous soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed in the active service of soldiers.
"The alleged damage occurred during the complainant's military service," says the document.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in battle.
It's time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her fight: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a complaint against the four main military academies for alleged promotion of a anti-female atmosphere.
Independent of this, the non-profit Vietnam veterans of America filed a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personal illness", who received rape victims to release them from the service - a common practice by activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veteran Administration (i.e. the administration of the war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who stated that they had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of clues.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e.: Office for Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses were displayed in 2010.
But most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: 20 percent of the cases in the military came to court in 2010 and only half as many as in civil law.
The complainants in Burkes Fall describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut in his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had had before the attack with her friend.
Six persons declared as character witnesses in the name of the suspected perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes were going to be put in. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I got out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
She was discharged in January 2010, so that she did not receive any support.
Whether the action that Lyman and the other complainants have filed is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my view, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that comes with liability.
He adds: "The odds stand against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the defendant's lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms occur," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers See You on Facebook
Before he became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to have committed his first public hearing before court during an amok race in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer until his attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British Idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopedical, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then visited them with add-ons, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the add-ons invited users to a survey that asked for their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 very right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a rather new method of research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, which add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beautiful thing about Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people you normally can't reach with your keyboard on the street.
"If you once tried to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook all this falls away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and resolve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their loud noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink problems than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, for example residential consultants, monitor the page and help a student when it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Author and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 interim elections and a National Happiness Index (with mainly information that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the page should make their large data find pit available for other research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the page they watch whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the page to deliver your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how much of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a keyboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of social affairs - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Calt and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood up for two amok races, in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, Breivik, who had a pre-written speech with him, refused permission to contact his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims’ relatives participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted to confirm that he stayed behind the castle and bars.
All took part in the goal that everything would go out of the way.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said a survivors of Utoya to the Norwegian radio NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it went a little further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked peacefully and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in his eyes as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had been complicits.
Some may have liked that the attacks of July 22 seem to have been the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 Lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technique as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in the recent job interview, which was dedusted this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and a self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acribical organizer who eagerly based on diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors suffer from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea is 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringenly developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialists" about the start of the personal computer. And he spent more than an hour together with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs were forced out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview has been used in specialist districts, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after jobs were discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will come to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for loathing detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly eager in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and are endeavored for accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs show perfectionism when it seems impatient to respond to Cring's questions and move him to deal more quickly with topics or side-by-side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow inconceivably far-sighted if jobs are assessed, which other companies make of their opinion correct or wrong and its own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the covetous dreamer who is on the jump to magnificence is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in the business I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found.
Jobs further carry out its efforts to rationalize the accounting with Apple.
Surprising how costs were recorded - most of the time they started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere presumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was especially honored:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could get into the telephone company and conduct long-distance calls for nothing.
Much has been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-power is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-based phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while sending as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and if you were to go to the phone, it would come out again a minute later in the phone next door," says jobs ticklingly.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a huge thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he almost subtracted when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were so good they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in my age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever created".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunsch Röhre and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up as a teenager at HP and hang on this machine and write programs for her.
How to improve innovations:
Jobs in the interview talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built up some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember slamming arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
On large companies that fail:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs anticipated the paths on which so many industrial giants with their visions got into stumbling blocks and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, so and what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it] such people who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly will be necessary by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products, exterminated - craftsmanship.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You've caught the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your fines.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes beyond the taste, it goes beyond trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to put these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in the staging of great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dance with opponents of the health laws, as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question of whether one will hear a challenge of the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was an action brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which last year was decided by the Congress, a law that became a keyword among conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer, who stands in court and will claim that the law is to be tipped, will probably be Paul Clement, once general attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenged the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmacist Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case, at a Washington hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of the federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If it were they, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in benefit events close to law and other organizations, where the judge must not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the associated law firms and to a company with a massive financial interest in it were enough to alert moral and government activists.
"This astounding break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the actions of some judges lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinned during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support for a donation campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix justice with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney-general under the Obama government when the first law-enforcements came before the court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from hearing the case because she was too committed to defending the law in order to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make institutions to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars on land
Airline Emirates orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with one option on 20 more aircraft.
Moreover, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company receives a contract over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big business when the company of aircraft manufacturers is Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is total with a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
Also unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend his greatest order of all times for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the airline of Emirates from Dubai.
Moreover, Boeing announced at Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, the airline has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that will raise the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock market specialist of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, since this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise less than other airlines, Dihora said.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the dominant position with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would be postponed the introduction of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported opponent Fausto Vallejo from PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results Fausto Vallejo won the race for the governor's post in the Western state from the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of the organized crime during the entire election process and especially on yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they have occupied election cabins, built road blockages ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, which had been conducted in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the current governor, came to the third place, a severe defeat for the split and unhappy left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence still continues.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left the local elections for fear.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, no matter how rebellious the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nito, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a bold look into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asia Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of ADB based in Manila, said that the world's two fastest growing economic nations must do "everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who are looking "incessantly" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all sitting in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then with all means."
Europe's monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rate costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Minister has resigned both from Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is frightening that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging emerging economies to join forces to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU-Settlement Fund bonds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - would give greater negotiating power to the European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, as its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro zone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no incentive to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less a day live.
"Sometimes they'll find out that the Greeks are retired at 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro zone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/threats now "the risk of graduation" due to the threat posed by Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" in order to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant loss of capital in their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defence
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta called the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unobservedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scene in Afghanistan and the civilian flow bands.
The Pentagon is already perceiving reductions of 450 trillion dollars in the course of the coming decade, but fears that further reductions of 600 trillion dollars or more will be necessary if the Congress is unable to reach a conclusion in the expenditure.
"The consequences of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure by the Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop to numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a thoughtless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects impermeable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernisation efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves involuntarily from most of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certainty in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were finally hit by the combat forces," said Panetta.
"While the war-time quotas in the anti-terrorist struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the base budget would adversely affect the war effort," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings were shortened, which would lead to delays in attitudes and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to wartime dealers and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a confiscation of the Department of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military force."
"We are vehement against this draconian act," said the Senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not that one should force us to."
"The confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and new senators' warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains pending.
Panetta has increasingly uncannyly expressed the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing heavy decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a gloomy picture, which could stand - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air-armed swab without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paperman, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a military force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She's making a really angry one."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta presented new details on how reductions " create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capacity for action and intervention, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the removal, including those already tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter vehicle, which Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If one stopped the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to defy a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how anxious and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming lord of the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides deny each other.
The management of Penn State is accused of perjury because it is said that one has held back reports after which a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week it was heard about an open microphone when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he put into circulation denials that were very quickly rejected by incontrovertible evidence.
The former presidential candidate, John Edwards, is accused of infringing campaign financing, which is linked to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about fraud in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the exam answers so that they could even do well in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheats are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognising lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for everyone to learn, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a game of society, such as puberty, in which the goal is to call "Be!", detachment of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most old myths were degenerated about lying.
Lies look into your eyes.
They don't always stutter, stem, roast, and snack.
But it must not be concluded that these liars are hard to reveal and defuse.
A trained liar can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of detarcation. And it is clear that detangling a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find comfort in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration are among our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, their interest and their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men appear more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been degenerated as an evildoer, others feel less guilty to have lied to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
That's called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your test person.
You should know better when someone normally trips with his foot constantly, so that they do not accuse him unjustly if he drops his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells, which shrill, not as evidence of detachment.
People who cheat may stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point toward the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relax after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhale and change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that a job interview is over, just to look after the job interview after this relaxation.
Also take care of the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Diving persons can also use a distant language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am aware ... to the best of knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, which often makes the alarm bells shriek.
There is no magic means for detachment of lies, but one can learn skills through which detachment is possible.
Thanks to these skills, each individual can become a victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk due to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, thus annoying the trade unions and at the same time calming environmentalists, the pipeline building companies are trying to replan the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the sand hills in Nebraska.
The company announced its decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company continues to be confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, though with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed which would avoid the area of the sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review, arranged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, may delay a decision by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to its support.
The 1700 mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators Nebraskas, who are against the plan, weighed down the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the main examiner of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether one company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, since it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued because she allegedly forced an infant out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a magic attack that would have put her little daughter in such fear that she gave herself to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personal change, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family at the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10th last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to start a family outing.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to yell - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started tipping water out of the bottle at me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell upon the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family apologized in writing but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The action is not a specific compensation, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he will not charge a fee and the family plan, the money they receive, will give to the child's cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behaviour," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is shown against a nurse who carries an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate resistance slowed the economy down
In the first year, where Mario López Valdez is at the government, unemployment and black-and-collar work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, Sinaloas will be remembered in economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and is a source of great hopes regarding economic growth, is on the government. However, as a result of the climateic contradictions, growth cannot be the case, but on the contrary, the most important economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also close limits to the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 3116 percent, which slowed down on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed. It was mainly concerned with vegetable, corn and chick pea cultivation.
The decline in economic activity by November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican state. In the first quarter, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6,19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. That is 18 969 people over the first quarter.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa dates back to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of the public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are observing today is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, losses in liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts in funds due to the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are forbidden to raise dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or otherwise use them," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined, due to the problems of entry and, on the one hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here looking for work, which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Unworked work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of the employees working in the country without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaryía del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
ADI decrease
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the highest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaryía de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to 630 597 dollars from January to June, equivalent to 87.74 percent in comparison to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
The Secretaryía de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) for its part recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 Pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debts
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
The first year of government of Mario López Valdé's inability to rule made clear to the representatives of the entrepreneurship.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to try twice. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to produce an economic dynamics that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefined vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Commerce Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa said that the state must be led to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, for it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There is much to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would guide government efforts on better track.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that it has worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 daily sentences, a resident of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic Procuratorate announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana for trade.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military forces in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road in respect of guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods have been handed over to the judge of the district and the criminal is still in the execution centre.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed due to lack of resources or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the urban social development authority stated that, although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds allocated to them that exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell on the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in construction can be expected.
"12 million have to pay for them, and although the year has already ended, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already begun construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the Government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to borrow a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign. This corresponds to the amount that the central government should have imposed.
"That had already happened to us during the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not spent on participating in these programmes," he said.
Even if the State authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance , , was requested to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"At least 12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already ending, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The switch from analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the President's Office and brought the change of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the bill with details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required to enable the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the action, which was prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the bill unconstitutional, as the regulation concerning radio and television was the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the reservation of laws.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the bill. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the bill and applied all the activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that if we did, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected," she also pointed out, for constitutional reasons, that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place around the world in recent years, and it will make better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
To postpone the changeover, she said, was to postpone the exploitation of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which had not only technical aspects, "because they covered economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made it necessary to act on the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of characteristics that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that, with the publication of the contested bill, the government was involved in the competences of the Congress, for the laws adopted by the legislative system would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of individual counting the votes in Michoacán is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual polling of the polls is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programmea deResultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that just last 9 November the electorate had adopted a series of rules to harmonise local rules with the reforms of the states in election matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted either his political constitution or his electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Scoreboard within the specified time limits with the argument or objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action filed by the local legislative system and considered the State Representative's vote on the Constitutional Reforms to be "ineffective and unlawful", since it did not have the right "to decide on it or to oppose a veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would be the possibility that the local electoral authority would be able to list the voting pages in part or in full.
The results of the minutes shall not be agreed under the following conditions: the vote counting and calculation protocol shall not be present or shall not be held by the chairman of the electoral committee or there shall be obvious errors or amendments to the minutes.
In addition, the total number of voting tickets completed may be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second place, equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request by the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of those candidates.
The number of votes may also take place in their entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages exposed to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of 923 voting protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rose to Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday the show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Lieutenant was that his ashes should be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After one honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the other, died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force. The closest persons attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the ashes of the Lieutenant were landed on the mourning hall, which is located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former students from the technical Abitur and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she felt that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would dizzy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to greet him as at the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán for the graduation of his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A Last Farewell
Under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López, Felipe Bacio Cortés, he was honored with all her honour. Her honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the head of school and students of the Saltillo Technological Education Institute, where he studied in 1985, and in both studies and sports, as well as excellent.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he had flown, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority were also crashing.
At 18.05 a.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by the Major Jaime Martinez, on the front square of the barracks, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the Fund, military members presented the media with eleven persons arrested in the same locality in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a shot of grace in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at 1.5 kilometres from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transitors saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall rose all the way up.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another who was clothed with a white top.
Nearly a meter away was the body of another person with red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on-site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place as no cartridges were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions that write an organized gang of criminals to another, and several shots have been found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of State for State Defense presented 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a criminal course that was mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who were associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunts) and secret funerals.

On Wednesday Formation of the new Italian Government
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present him with the new government, which is supposed to give rise to the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present him with the new government, which is supposed to give rise to the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A announcement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of government.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of the cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties on government.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well placed," he added.
Monti managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Italy, in the meantime, is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the debt costs to an unbearable level.
The new government led by the former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a hard package of savings, which has been called upon by the Euro-politics to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on the haste, which is burdening Monti, was reinforced by the changing market situation, which caused the Italian government bonds to be charged with 7 percent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European Rescue Screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industry Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in every way."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Montis' chances of success were considerably increased by the support of the PDL party from Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Middle-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of the Technocrats-based government, which is called Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks, with its remark that Montis is a disaster, is also pressured.
Monti started his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and trade unions, as well as with youth and women organisations.
The session is scheduled to be completed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After recent respiration towards the end of last week, when Berlusconi was known to withdraw, because of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs for the Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a government debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue shield.
Monti said that his government would have to last until the next elections expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disunity between the parties complicate the involvement of persons from political life.
Spanish have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on the bumple.
From Costa Ricas only one of the 22 called-in 50 games has behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game held today at 15.05 a.m. in the San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-colored team has only Michael Umana as the only one with more than 50 international games.
This number he reached last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the league de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury with complicated excretion games at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico football players, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the Concacaf, which is listed below on the FIFA ranking list.
We'll see how the Spanish team pulls their last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached a match with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on Saturday against England (low 0-1 in London) with 126 games abroad.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the stormer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games feature in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the side of the national team come Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20's limit.
While Nacho Moral only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet made their debut.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot most gates with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that realizes itself"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the national stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will be realized for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 7.30 p.m.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation whose complete copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true for us.
This is the second time we've been playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, and you're experiencing the most intense days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We needed almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have needed so long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've made in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are excited about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we're not going to set limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play some songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Each one likes another song so that the decision we will play will not be easy.
If we take two or three songs that we haven't played any longer into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked them. Otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined playing once in a great rock band for more than 20 years. This seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like ourselves and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then, a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual if five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are glad to be still friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like the one you stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands can survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being still alive and that we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical ways have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We could not be better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to miss this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, remember that you have to pay attention to the music and to what she has created, without being forgetful of being a famous rock star. We have never been interested in that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible man Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live, which will definitely be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
One of the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk about the bassists I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that appeared at the same time. If they are still important today, I think this is great, because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhony are doing better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that might seem a bit lightly. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed play them. It's very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - that influences your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly represent it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informing his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violations of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congress member and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that he thought Fujimori could be welcomed for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish for this because he thought him innocent.
It has been operated on four times in tongue cancer and it has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, further diseases such as a severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, were counted by the doctor.
Fujimori is located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policia prison since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss policy issues of the region
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón, who, according to the Uruguay President, will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for support from Calderón regarding the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chair of the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concrete exchange of tax information agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries which have not introduced all international tax cooperation standards.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for the salvation of Princess Peach for 25 years from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never yet in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month on the shop counters of all the world, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the portable Ninende 3DS console, with which without a special glasses can be played three dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, the controller for the Nintendo specialized press in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning for this console" , because so far, successful articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations to existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman stressed that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "usual" video game that allows for a quick, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "light" to catch the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the various game levels that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects" always have to be played three-dimensional.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The moustache installer has to overcome with dangers speckled platforms in order to free the princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the motions, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy for money laundering of $70 million.
Thus, the trial ends on the US's request for Portillo's extradition, so that it can be brought to trial there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision on the independence of judicial force and government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered in court decisions and had granted all the extradition requests he had been informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is handed over for murder and serious physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are used to condemn the former President of the State (2000 - 2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered when its legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the neglect of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his time of government, which preceded extradition, but the minister filed a contradiction and revitalized the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was launched to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social assistance organisation have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6000 young people who were threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, an event took place in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was set up in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of training, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday was attended by a large number of representatives of institutions and institutions who worked together with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in different directions at election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist education ministers Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is “a good foundation”.
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people in trouble hope.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house, where huge parties were organized, was cleared
The house owners had 11 of 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Nr. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on the street Balmes have ended.
Yesterday afternoon, twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had been illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the room, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, entry will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The occupiers who had occupied 11 of the 13 dwellings of the building - the rest were inhabited - took along the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. Furthermore, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also caused damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the landlords made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had been indicated by the neighbors because of rest disorder, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors to the disco, but from the householders and especially from the guests of the festivals who were organized there, and who, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, became more and longer in recent weeks.
The party responsible for discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that it would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from its neighbours in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for the building to be cleaned up without delay and to address the problems of bourgeois cohabitation and the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months the house-occupiers had been forced into all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, even thefts had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., the police approached the road Montraal No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender, apart from the disputes about the fees.
The urban call for 16 gates opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its paper on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became the uppermost in Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is among the few that spread not in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
As a model now no longer served the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogibar.
As far as the city was concerned in September, a huge tender, consisting of 16 competitions, was issued for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either it is, or someone's planning to put gates on the ground.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The invitation to tender is the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a point of view of reflection on the city.
It is almost a recurrent topic, which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can rely on.
And this very fact offers the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
After the attack on the coast, it is necessary for Roldán to talk about the "Front on the Mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been carried out over the green apples.
"One should assume from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" carries a "lexical trap": It must not be "as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas to be dealt with."
Modol, like Rollán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge", which poses "some dangers".
Dangers due to the "insecurity that the design of a public space today brings with it" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation on what can be built.
"To limit something means always to define the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [relating to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, means simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "beat on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "questions" as to whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right one", he says. "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, because in the terms of the call for tenders a global view of Collserola is missing: "There have been 16 competitions in the cross section," he says, "on the axis mountain lake. But there is no longitudinal perspective that considers the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, creating a soft transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of Casino Red liberated the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial led against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the agent of Casino Red has granted him a trial against the mayor of Monterrey's brother for extortion before the Second Criminal Court of the District.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás can be seen, which is thought to force him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the bethouse.
After the prosecution, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Público Minister had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre, because he probably had bribed Casino Red's owners with a million and a half pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security tract, as murder threats existed against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a warrant was sent to him by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that, after the almost two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to justify Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bethouse in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to give the mayor's brother the penalty, which is why he will be set on foot in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, assigned to the court, asked if he had corrected the damage and which the owner of the bethouse had pronounced his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held back the name.
According to the 197/2011 case, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. No opposition to the trial can be filed, no compensation is required.
After the hearing of the representative of the matchhouse at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set on foot.
The Secretary of Justice, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the plane accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaryía de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation on the accident that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people indicate that the helicopter has been hit directly against the ground with its entire unspoilt structure, without the pilot having been able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which was why he fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area on which the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so he fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an angle of 7-30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Airplanes and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at a speed of travel and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of impact it was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, added six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Find flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, this was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team would have had sufficient vision during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the next flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Starting point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the aircraft remains in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was hit straight and sideways.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was hit on the ground with its unscathed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The leftovers of the aircraft do not allow to close on fire or explosion at the accident site.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloppy and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is probably broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter might have had several ground contacts.
Following a minor search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, thus increasing the assumption that the unspoiled aircraft structure had been hit against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She conducts a research project on finding the gene for obesity in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene of obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (division for medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Sigo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the Postgraduate Programme at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested persons can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 p.m. tests will be carried out with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation had begun at the Cuauhtémoc sports ground (in the west of the state of México) and was continued since October 8 at the Nezahuelcóyolt Sports Square (in the east of the state of México).
Once the target of 500 to 600 researchers has been reached, the study will continue at the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide Diabetes Day, he stated that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 years should be asked to fill in with the consent and supervision of their parents with food-related questionnaires.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal failure.
He further stated that on the above Saturdays the subjects would be measured (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (such as the identification of genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of the health care staff about the alarming increase in the weight of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 revealed that in nearly six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that the obese girl increased by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) averaged 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African origin, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn the surplus of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants was in a comprehensive study of the children in which it was determined whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (Akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the precursor stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors, explaining all measurement results to the parents and proposing changes in the lifestyle appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short ways.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, Bread, Pizza, Hamburger, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents hitholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM University of Mexico, develops polymer modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs were to be taken from the street floor, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 hitholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the layout and maintenance of the asphalt covering was appropriate, the number of hitholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture, "Treasureholes from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, develops asphalt modified polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which, however, has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of the street floor and thus avoid the occurrence of punching holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most heavy part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which have a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malts. Together they give the road covering its characteristic toughening behavior.
Tail elastic behavior of asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very soft and at 50°C almost solid, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resilience of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The FQ's researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible street covering, which consisted of six layers of materials, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a layer of asphalt, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this layer of wear, had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on and the forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the road covering.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On the wear layer," he explained, "is designed a final layer, the so-called carrier consisting of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
The majority of the forces that receive and distribute this road covering also require an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates into the layer and becomes difficult again. This causes all layers of the street floor and as a result the occurrence of impact holes.
When a punchhole is created," he said, "the cover layer is initially removed, while the wear layer is only affected after that. But the damage is not immediately caused, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sisthema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road covering must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research projects were still waiting for him, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the hit holes could be repaired easily and without using high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with standing on the winning stage, showing a silver crown and the band she's showing as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already came to 14 mistitles and Melina joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown. Among the proclaimed misses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the downfall of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also had received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the decision of the jury to appoint it as the First Miss is that she did not believe the answer to the question "What book has affected you the most and why?" she had been asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I think it's a kind of civilization, in the end, I believe that the book, which was most important for my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a rather deep book.
I am currently reading 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called 'Legendships'.
An answer that came up with little reluctance, first because of the concept of 'civilization' and second, because it had not specifically explained how each of its books had influenced them.
But after the ceremony was completed, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred one, who was home to all the condolences and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-cooked costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous, which the Queen was stressful, which could not shine on stage."
And this was noted in their first performance in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in their two lifts at the coronation celebration.
Although she was safe in both, she lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned a miss shows "that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition will eventually not become queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essential element of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that she had already worked on projects before she participated in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the Derriers and the fibrosis that she was noted in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, for the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queens' Trainer, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which I honestly found hard to notice, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that the faults of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make her do it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the bathing suit a cruel prediction arose, which was to come true at night. It was chastised that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let it come to the benefit of the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina has started her reign year from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent one of the international competitions at the time of the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia.
However, she will go into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A California Lophoscopic man who identified "Alfonso Cano" entered the story.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a Lophoscopist from Cali (CTI) investigation unit, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Democratic Armed Forces of Colombia), entered: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopic men in the CTI department, Eliazar González had this week been a volunteer service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó's communities, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify.
In 2000 he settled after Valle over and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was expecting him.
He flew from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be one. Therefore, he should take along the ten-finger sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the examiner, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, for this was similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media, not least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, plant kennel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the prints of the body with those on the print sheet.
It was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
In Search of Tracks
For a Dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arrested, many offenders present false ID documents or they have none.
We'll take the fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had just raised his hand with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walks are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for the acceptance of fingerprints. But in this case, we were able to take the full hand print and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead person was found surrounded by snap bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle corresponded.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopeist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plantel or a band is used for taking away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the People's Office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers," said the CTI expert.
He said not everything was the way it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold, which shines, isn't everything you touch, it's a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you carry out a similar comparison.
The "enraged" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators collided in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the space order and changed their location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday when they tried to re-enter the Manhattan Square with a judicial order after being cleared from the square in dawn and tried to occupy another place on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators conspired in front of the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to enter with a judicial order that allowed the "enraged" the new tents at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the space order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
According to Bray, the answer of the "sufferers" to her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent space of the place and approved the protesters of the tents.
In addition, the "enraged" occupied a new park, which is located at the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give any exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people would have arrived at this place, where also religious leaders were appointed as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing, which is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the room in the dawn is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them. They even gave them some police guards who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small collisions", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to clear members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that, due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been removed. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the room of the Zuccotti Square, held in dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and decided to do so because the demonstrators "wrung against the law."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the arrangement for the space because he had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", for "some businesses had received threats" and the residents were "fearing for their quality of life".
"The room in the morning gray was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesperson of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of the press".
The officers of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Alles Assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
Today, the private TV channel CTV announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (bald singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will perform on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will take life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV spread pictures of the TV program, in which Anderson - which also appears for the distribution on the Internet of a self-scathed porn, in which she, together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears - appears as Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap that Jesus is to represent.
Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently appeared as a moderator in the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen as Jesus Child.
CTV's Christmas programme not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
During one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is born again after the earthquake
GDP growth by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and end the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since the last of March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake that resulted in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced during the Second World War.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo assessed property damage at $300 000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of the case, the gross domestic product data from July to September finally completed this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the fall by 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsiaan attacks that use the crisis to build up or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been alerted, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increasing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has fled to one of the "repatriation currencies" of investors who fled from the debt crisis of the eurozone and the cloudy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to the Yen's listing.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the Yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy, yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had provided clearer signs of a slower economic development in September.
The indicator predicting the turning points of the world economy revealed that the brake would have been pulled in the face of the greatest economic potential.
Because it dropped by four tenths to loose 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is 100, after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Makes Doubts Come Again
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth, which emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the 100 days agreed upon during his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new savings measures and in no way take back his call for new elections at the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear the doubts of his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million Athens urgently needs. He made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties were to sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika "very soon" would come back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what for the payment of the sixth section" amounting to 8000 million euros is "needed", although there is still no final date.
The Greek kid still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide".
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded us yesterday that Spain has become the second donor for this means of international cooperation in the last two decades. It is based on "the instrument of social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen announced yesterday the fifth World Summit on Smallest Credit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living the number of persons who have to live with incomes of less than a dollar per day, that is, below the "marginal border".
Spain is also "to continue working" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world, and it carries out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit which lasts until Thursday will be "to create new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "are faced with many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty limit.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the concept of microcredit goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist who committed herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience followed one year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her the assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as "presencer of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by animated those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to commit development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credits were "a most serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised countries now "more than ever" should work according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, accused "the success", "marginized" people who "are always in front of closed doors" of giving "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city who opened "their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig, was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democrat Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but it has prevailed in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy to be too lax today and possibly Italy's tomorrow.
The President-in-Office's proposal for a Presidency of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstained.
The standing ovation that lasted several minutes, due to the lack of intervention of Angela Merkel and some hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, did not leave any doubt on the part of the three ministers of finance in Europe.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the applications - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which strengthens the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote", in order to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely it is little likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the case, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weight each country on the Governing Council in line with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously gave rise to a first gearing of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European proposal for the importance of "German-French friendship" is devoted to a paragraph, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
Factically one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in the event of disease?
According to the family benefits, UMP and government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family aid fund, and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
However, in order to accompany this attack, which is based on the attempt to test the economy in a harsh manner, on the other hand, is no less prelude to an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is planning the introduction of a fourth day of leave before taking into account a health report from private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the wage of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to promote anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And the one with a different measure was rather symbolic: to give the state officials an unforgivable karenz day in the case of illness (until now, unlike the three days of karenz in the private sector, there is no karenz period).
While these issues are in the discussion, the majority is also reiterating the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with the work-absence.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition they will be remunerated if this is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13th, in front of the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports seem to be somewhat unproportional.
In fact, it has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives that have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer more ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first stay with the country-wide figures.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of the Health Service, daily payments in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% of maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54% of sick leave, which is 6.2 billion euros.
And that means 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted on average only 14.5 days of sick leave compared with the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
A mean value that conceals certain differences: another one published by Monster.com, career planning website in 2007, showed that 75% of 40,000 surveyed, reported French workers, did not take a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, shows that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
In comparison with their European neighbours, the French workers tend no more than elsewhere to become incapacity for work.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absence (disease or otherwise) rose from 10% to 11% in France compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the case of disease reports is a seemingly low proportion of black-and-white work.
With regard to fraud, there is only a weak impact here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 implies that there are systmatic controls in cases of disease that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized short-term health reports, which were in 37,050 cases, were unwarranted or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of disease of more than 45 days of duration, 11% were included in "adapted or unwarranted" cases, i.e. 132.000.
In total, this makes 169.000 "unwarranted" cases for several million workers who have filed a health report.
A point which represents only a weak impact on, for example, those of black-and-collar work.
According to UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a technical report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus much more than the fraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced to Parliament, adding the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone "is at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos plans to reduce the state deficit of the country "to reduce the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject the new savings measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had predicted that his party would not be prepared to take an additional saving measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a parliamentary assembly of his Party's New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties to support the planned measures, had Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and he would not sign under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanying free death must be legalized, according to an expert body
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain-reducing agents, and this goes beyond the cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a start, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut down on the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkilling means, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority wish of the Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of these eventually die in the hospital.
From the country as a whole, the rate of 86% of deaths occurred in the hospital in Quebec is highest.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already expressed itself, does not want to amend any of the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts who have inspected all the countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicides, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such violations especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, as confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconferencing conference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanied suicide is also practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already appeared in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that they allow persons at the end of their life to alleviate their sufferings.
And 66% believe that the issue of legalisation of euthanasia does not result in the message to convey that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
As for those who have already practised a accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintenance or discontinuation of resources in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should indicate that the decommissioning of the funds for which there was a legal refusal should not be considered as criminal.
The expert body also calls for health care professionals to be trained to respect a decommissioning of resources at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated in pain-reducing treatment to provide the best pain-reducing agents, and this goes beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, the body calls for pain relief or life-consuming measures as far as the health care resources already used in the Canadian health institutions are concerned, at least to consider them, as they were no longer used to reduce physical pain, and they resort to the same procedures.
Subjects of other experts
Some health care experts have already made reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has referred to the position of the reporting experts as "extrem" among other things, since it did not set any limits to the euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age asks another person to help him with his suicide," says RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put individual responsibility over all other values involved in the social activities of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report she quoted as "Pro-Euthanasia Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the information relating to the non-existent of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus Announces a "Completed"
Syria is insulated
The partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assads, however, which, thanks to the support of Russia and which has a "competition" directed against the country, has strengthened yesterday.
Two days before Syria's exclusion by the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the current Arab Prime Minister who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his power of office in Syria" in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Baschar were interested in his country, he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned by success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy this need to go," he explained in allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country, on which Turkey has a constantly harsh attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "improvement of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone in the face of repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region in southern Syria have died, so the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, had been killed in the besieged city of Hom's "fire changes and heavy bombings around Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian foreign trade minister, Walid al-Muallim, nevertheless considered that the country "taxes to the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a "hazardous step".
He added that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French foreign trade minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to protect civilians from repression of the regime, which he felt would be encapsulated in his "Paranoia".
An extra-planning new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on the rise of the crisis on 2 November, in particular the controversial, anticipated withdrawal of the military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lawrov has described the Arab League's decision as "uncorrected" yesterday, in order to prevent any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready for sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that requires "sacrifice" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former Commissioner of the EU held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before the present meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims", said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, on the other hand, had been waiting for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will be included in the presentation presented by M. Monti of a list of cancellations, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets took their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, under the observation that "the markets will be duly and discreet".
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets in the first place, but the unrest had once again strengthened, especially after an unexpected industrial decline in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister should set up a staff of mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politics".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's proof of confidence by Friday.
Since the start of his duties, M. Monti has committed himself to working in all urgency in the sense of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
One speaker from Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "we do not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy even in the light of the new government."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budgetary adjustment in 2013, despite the savings plans that have been launched in recent months, has in particular requested new toughening measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "Chefin of the bosses" of Italy, which will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to boost the economy" as a country that has no growth to show, which cannot respect deficit indicators".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "examination of trustworthiness" and a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the durability of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferential elections, as Italy will now have to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, confirmed on Monday an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents based on this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had reported its "serious concern" last week on the occasion of a "opportunity military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, the Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "Nano-Diamant".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA stated that Iran's development "was supported by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only in this technique but also, as one member of the Agency stated, worked directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin through his entire career through this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims and crimes increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes either slightly decreased or increased during the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crime against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has increased to 6,628 cases in a very weak measure, including 47,3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights Organization Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible member of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards "fellow crimes".
The "fellow crime" is a legacy in American federal law from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform in order to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service resemble those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow better reading live to understand the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet user, whose messages ("Tweets") are persecuted and who track your messages.
This allows them to find out if they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August at a low percentage of users", the Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner announced before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, with a somewhat esotherical-looking text (RT for referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisaeur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" via the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and likes too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Function "Activity" will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux twitter," explains @danykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "golden household rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday the Austrian government of the Great Socialist/Christian Democratic Coalition decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the top bond of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the payment capacity of Austria had not fallen at a stroke from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Foreign Minister.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State or Government would then have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to have included such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of GDP each year, while from 2017 onwards, the structural deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP, whereas the regional states as well as the municipalities should have balanced households.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt in the horizon of 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set out in the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in the monetary markets
On Tuesday, the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that the Japanese power of office would again intervene on the monetary markets if the yen were to continue to rise.
If we were to establish an excessive volatility in the Yen exchange rate, we would intervene just as we did the last time," said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, Yen was once again speeded up close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo had sold massive yen for dollars to reduce the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of raising a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen above this, husked by purchases of investors who consider the yen to be "a source of refuge" in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro was slipped under the symbolic slat of 105 yen near the levels that had hit the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the Archipelago, as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn from Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for his reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11th, which devastated the region of Tohoku (Nordosten),", emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that this inflation of the Yen could kill the weak upswing already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third world power gained -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the leap in export growth and consumption of the "plombed" households.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the inflation of the Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to disarm the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has informed us that the BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures", which made it known that on Wednesday no additional currency relief is to be expected.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to eliminate the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover that it had spent on different purchases of financial instruments in order to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast up, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the debt crisis constantly undermines the European key figures.
Despite the take-up of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries are increasing steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are also drifting a little further in negative terms on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"As a result of the new tensions with regard to the yields of government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue part of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, in turn, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a Baisse of 0.7%.
""Japan has as well as the rest of the world's eyes focused on Europe, and trade moves on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates co-founder Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency that continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1,3570 dollars, so it was by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, after the CDU, the Party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in the Congress on Monday, had granted a request which, in particular, provided for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without at the same time leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's interest rates remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on the Italian bonds reached 6.85% this year, reaching 6.2% that of the Spanish titles.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to nourish the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the decisions taken on 27 October were "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visor of markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expected growth rates of the eurozone
Statistically speaking, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the INSEE Statistical Office had revised the Baisse figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbing to economic experts.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first calculation of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting on the occasion of reflection on this subject and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, there is no need for an enormous share of the world's population to be left out of a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continued to remain isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just about to build only or nuclear power plants of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to attract another unit to Fukushima's park by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant, which was closed after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, based on renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as an example, reality is contrary to the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on Russia due to increased use of imported gas, particularly as a result of the increase in CO2 emissions generated by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European leader in wind energy, from which it carries 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately using wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the resistance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness as well as an industrial stability deposit on national soil, the French companies have an advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which would lead to the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as willing to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to get out of nuclear power, most of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and annual EUR 6 billion of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would be reduced more and more.
If the decline of its producer is preprogrammed, which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is just as little a miracle as a devil’s work to generate electricity.
The CO2-poor solutions developed by Areva, for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy, testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, must be possessed by the security show.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only a single one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so he went without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as indebted human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters was caused by never-dained mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two preceding ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that enables it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to travel the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that equally determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights" as France itself had called itself.
Recently, the public authorities’ harassment against foreign students had marked the weekly shows, and the Minister of the Interior had inadvertently announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need any talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
On this issue there is a broad consensus between the right and the left.
On the right, Jacques Chirac's tone, which had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrants, are not likely to pose a problem for a country", was declared by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "can't take up the world's entire poverty".
Only difference exists in the degree of greatness
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hoards of Polish plumbers was shared by both right and left in 2005.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is to the extent that there is a desire to express to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities pointing out that partnership development allows us to solve our "immigration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is cost-effective economically.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present in a recently published work, which summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute local workers, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage workers, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors which are unburdened at work.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers are not very attractive, the more skilled among immigrants are working in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetics, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and national labour market situation between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigrant flood resulted in a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is contributing (high proportion of indigenous immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries, on average, about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that an immigrant aged 30 to Germany, on average, brings a net contribution (incomes minus expenditure) to the public budget of around 150,000 euros over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with his teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, were exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had been able to cope with the tragedy of the First World War, Totalitarianism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed that it was rich to exercise the right to vote in the most directly possible way possible to see democracy once and for all over their enemies.
Since Napoleon one knows "the little one" that it was a characteristic of attitude.
The general right of election, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can just as well become an "oppressive instrument" as expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the forces, a training, education, an economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is just as serious and, first of all, political and democratic crisis.
The change in the attitude of the Greek True-Falsh referendum would have had a double insightful character in this respect: once again the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their disappropriation.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to press for a success of the national referendum, which has been organized according to the needs and the wrong order.
A license for the European sole ruler or a leap with connected eyes into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe.
It is all Europe that bows to the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies that suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all of Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations attached to it.
The urgency is to give popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project back to hand.
For it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level as a condition which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without causing us to perish.
After this proposal has been fought over for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today is pushing European economic leadership to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - it would be a further folly and a further dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it took the fact that Republicans were "creating".
The revolution of the interests alone could not afford enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form an integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" Chip Cards Become the General Good
On Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris, the world trade fair for chip cards opens its gates in an optimistic manner.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology, which enables payments in public transport or charging of purchases by simply keeping the card to a reader.
This year 460 million contactless chip cards were sold this year compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Its market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to the contactless payment to the ground after it has been behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary that banks equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically hand over bank cards with contactless chip to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearingly low percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out these transactions.
"They're in arrears."
"But they should experience a real upward trend at least next year."
"We expect to sell from 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012, says Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also said yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer that allows their customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist Front understands itself, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram seem to confirm themselves.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelram Messahel himself, confirmed that Algiers had now acquired "security".
"The way in which both organizations deal with and the relations of the intelligence services point to a clear cooperation," he explained.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations on the abduction of two French people in Niger last January have promoted interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, are said to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French Special Units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find a number of phone chips in the ruins at the site of use that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the telephone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we have to wait for clearer evidence before we can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's imaginable."
"For years now, it has been known that the sect refers to financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "supports" have become increasingly visible in their course, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide agents and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, in order to start with Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, for a long time considered the group to be a community of Illuminates, who do not have to be given special attention.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means so much as "Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirat in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
She politicalizes and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, while the activists attached to her engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their reinforced attacks against the Commissioners.
The reaction on the part of Abuja, however, is, as usual, differentiated.
The army surrounds the city, it counts 800 dead.
The prisoner Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she became known for an attack in Jos, which called for 80 people's lives, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the debt of a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations became a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been alarming all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned about Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and was ready to show "all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and the assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis - weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
If one listens to the Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-deputies have repeatedly made known their thunderous statements as well as their statements on foreign policy, traditional republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel’s aid - often in no way supported - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to sue them the "Currency manipulation" - a leading topic in an America that is most appealing to Asia through the demigration of entire industries.
It was stupid if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost tied the air to his emotions of flattering.
He had called for a manual but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being heard because he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's Ebony
Romney had also praised military beatings against Iran if sanctions to stop the nuclear programme failed.
"If I'm elected, I command Iran to stop," he sounded.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel's military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-ranking candidate, has, on his part, a disgraceful lack of knowledge of the file.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be given to Kontra, since Beijing "was trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military beatings against Iran, said that he was willing to employ the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against terrorists by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political weight.
The current presidential counterparts are opposed to Reagan having also had simple ideas and despite all of this won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which was the subject of antiterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the swift withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
This animosity, however, is not quite so unenforced.
The population appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America had to be rebuilt economically in order to revitalize its leadership.
North Stream, New Gate to Russian Gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the sea floor of the Baltic Sea and connects the Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is said to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with shine and gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at fine tasting buffet the initiation of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned together the control of the valve, which transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first 1.224 km long pipeline connecting the Sankt Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And one already makes the possibility of building a third line sound on its own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and point-specific completion of this huge structure seems like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land road.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close the entry to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not retreaded to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of decommissioning European energy, as the project has broken between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries with strong gas consumption and their gas reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arteries that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the initiation of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which major gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin with regard to the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at a depth of about 200 m.
During their construction, mine fields dating from the Second World War had to be removed.
"Approximately hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for the sake of caution," stated Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream Society.
In addition, increased measures to protect fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything throughout the length: neither through valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have distanced themselves from it, as the Sweden had little desire to see a Russian state company settled in a permanent manner at the level of its coasts.
"In the case of a harry, we close the gas through in less than a minute," Jens Müller explained.
In the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline disappears into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors as little likely, since the welds were estimated to be a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes by a seaship, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures a meter in diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit.
Five societies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are subdivided ( each to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport, on renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the really transported amount of gas is", explained Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured 30% of shareholders as well as 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For example, for GDF Suez, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are able to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline appears on a sandy, pine forested coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlets.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight with the writing done hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggchal-colored sides, as it is aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as you know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant to the company, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (mole skin), which refers to a cotton bag, which is used, for example, for cover of upholstery benches.
This kind of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsible at Modo Modo.
Success is taking place.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increased by 26% and established with a sales of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, ranging from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which in its beginnings had 12 employees, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new need for writing, which exists despite the upswing of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: the brand recently launched an exposure called "Detour ( detour)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also launched a cover with Leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of time and understood how to diversify its products: bags, calendar of dates, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which today's Syntegra Capital, and presented a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled people at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled people is always twice as high as the average mean: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouragement?
"No, says Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who executes the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done."
It must be said, however, that for disabled people there are still many obstacles before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a degree, and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million higher education students.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work, and which form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled people.
So much to the material brakes.
Stay the unpronounced, the attitudes, which, although surely, yet slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed have "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled", which "overrepresents" is "by persons in wheelchairs, psychological or intellectually minors".
The result is that the private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled persons, which was set out in a 1987 law.
The latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now in charge of the 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for bringing in contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The proof: The number of establishments paying the payment has been reduced as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially among large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of firms between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled persons, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a lucky thing."
Before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 a.m.) the foreheads, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens did not hide their pleasures, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would have taken too far to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to conclude peace.
Five months after his temperamental gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national "It is a unity that justifys everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "enjoyment".
The French national team has been on fire since the age of 7 years, and he has led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he says.
"We've just walked on the way."
"To be allowed to play them means great happiness!"
Like this, it was with kindness that Lekens made "stolz" sound.
"The pride of carrying out a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbors" - that France " has again become a team at very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees himself very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he emphasized.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will notice this at the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the replay against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
==References====External links==
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees herself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to press the thing down the important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outward door."
At home, however, in its brightly illustrious Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that would be equally hot at stake, even if the game was, of course, announced as "very narrow", said the optimistic, but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are absolutely convinced to win the top hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor to Carlos Queiroz relativized.
On Friday, the final decision in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
A decision can already be taken by the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved an outward door," says Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would already have to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, "not to give you time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time in fact.
