Members of Welsh Assembly worried they're going to look like fools.
There are consternations among some members of the meeting about the proposal that their title should be changed from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the police spectrum are afraid that it can provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhyme."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A member of the assembly of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "obvious" about the change of name, but noticed that it was a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter you are pronounced.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently designing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As far as the AM's title is concerned, the Commission has preferred Welsh Parliament Members of WMPs, but the MWP option has received most approval in consultation with the public.
AM's seem to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to put forward a bill about the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes in the working methods of the meeting, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last statement in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change in country’s name
voters will vote on Sunday or change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular voice was arranged in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, who himself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been demanding for a long time that the name of his neighbor in the north represent a claim in his area and has repeatedly made a break against his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's get quiet because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two is there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he says.
"Crowds are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the types of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining havens.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore bring the day that these churches completely shut even closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black church that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A culturing treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carilion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been playing at St. Martin's for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, made up of laymen--written in July to the diocese with concern that the diocese "is going to try to transfer the cost" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark Injuries 13-year-old on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the herb season in California, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowing closer with a group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he cried, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole leg was torn open," saw Hammel when he came to the boy.
'I've called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media education session that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan extension to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenham are struggling with department store-type beauties manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while selling fashion and household goods back, the larger beauty walks in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if it is a success to be taken next year to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets search for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of its available cosmetics to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique makeup series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something on which more younger buyers insist.
Furthermore, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon in southern London last week and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience shops means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores will look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back against Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both these chains two years ago, which according to their groceries sales strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument as to how the profit from the pharmacies should be divided within his shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-store pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names is designed to satisfy every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now a commanding beauty destination challenging the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones' anger after Holly withdraws Willoughby from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones ran away 'wrote' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her from a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand activity to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their housewear-and-additional trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trading name.
The This Morning provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones enraged by withdrawing their winning lifestyle brand - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says that Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she can no longer spend enough time on their home clothes-and-access trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trading name and would have doubled according to the initiated Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority by far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her over the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw from her was absolutely stupid to all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the introduction.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning Provider, one of Britain’s stars that makes the most money flow in, can drive the firm millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes, and the possibility that its introduction may encounter even more delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby prepared Truly with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard words, and then we fall in love.
He mocked at criticism that he was going to get from the news media because he had made a remark that some would consider "unprecisional" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma- "newreader voice."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' convention in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We are making excellent progress with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have yielded positive results, ending rocket tests, helping free hostages, and causing the remains of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to come into 'this crowded arena, we'd have nearly 200 people standing right there," Trump said while pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tidal Gulf and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroyed Island, Dead Hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have been said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population are displaced, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
"In many cases they were very clear that they didn't ask for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the global tremor that Indonesia continues to endure, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, though a warning of power.
It is most challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's reeled infrastructure a central point of his campaign of election and has spent heavily on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Yoko’s administration is plagued by funding shortages as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sluggish sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was some 30 years out of the Chelsea target and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking far to the finish point.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it floated to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just to try to get into that position, to come to the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge coming and typing once and not thinking too much about it and just kicking."
Chelsea had been 1-0 at half-time before the Belgian star Eden Nazareth had recorded a target in the 25th minute.
In that play area, the Blues' goalhead re-played to Mateo Kovacic before clung near the middlefield and nailed into the Liverpool heels.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended with a left foot-head past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest destination.
Liverpool waged the battle against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea arrives on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Death valley rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, said the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the garbage of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, to collapse, and burners from up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was stowed with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, under suspicion of murder after wife has been beaten to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knife sticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to move forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us, since they may have information that can be indispensable to us to investigate.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who are said to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue, as the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now said to take hours before they are reintroduced.
It has been heard that a police officer tells one man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said repeatedly, 'It's so awful.'
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials are left within the cord to monitor the block apartments.
Any person with information is asked to call @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial hit with 'rewrite history' disputes
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects of art carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "smoothness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell's form outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image - storming of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of memoriality.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is established is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave form to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and memorial."
Killer Pig Tears Chinese Farm
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his of, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn off butcher covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring porcupine.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig had killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and torn," said the cousin, who was called on his of, "Wu," the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs that have attacked people have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound-pig tied a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "quick".
"They're not playful.
They're little picks, very curious... they're not bent on hurting you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The giant of Hurricane Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rain to southwest U.S.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it travels over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rain throughout northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.u., a category 1 hurricane from 5 a.m. on Sunday and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a troop over the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start to drive heavy tropical humidity northwest into the southwest US.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trick over the coming days will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous instant floods, waste flow, and possibly land spills in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Fast floods may be with rapidly worsening conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture it into the wilderness on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - pounded deserts to touch rivers and thunderstorms will bring violent local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause small waste flow and smooth rivets.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
A few scattered tropical rain showers will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains are spread more widely late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic short - distance temperature changes.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. is Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, delaying summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern US will begin warm October, with widespread 80's from the southern low plain to parts of the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees [80 ° C] on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher risk of above-average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watching Board Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks on the gripping testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political death point continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-nipper turn: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh beat her in drunkenness and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people looked at it on Friday, reported Nielsen.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest continued high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was trapped on CNN and CBS Friday morning, where objectors shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes beaten down for a few minutes as CNN vividly portrayed how he was being mispronounced.
"I'm standing right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and that he would have more to say at the committee hearing before the elevator door.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all later living hours when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would do this only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat minority requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump filed an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political play" with Britain's future and subverting national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to one with her on the cover of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's rates was "very ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspicious Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-grade murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the struggle.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-affiled WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he had killed Wayde.
His bail was fixed at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
The judicial autopsy office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound at the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's runaway task force, the State Police's crime laboratory, Southern University Police, and territorial citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanks territory law application for his "zealousness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team in "flag" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're always worried about," said Wayde.
Volcano Spouse Than On Mexico City
As weeding from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after taking up activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash releases over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thunders and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas covers car windscreens near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geographicians have marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which has been sitting 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 central Mexican in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists before commemorating independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters collided with riot police, and thousands joined counter demonstrations to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for retirement.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by riot police, bombarded them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually teemed with tourists.
A cavalry also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their batons to control the fight.
In several hours pro-independence groups sang in one tone "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' cries of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-minded region one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by separatis-catalans.
voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against instigation who had largely boycotted the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted violent clashes to prevent the voting at the polls throughout the region.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet navel - crappy victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled to keep momentum this year, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he was going to stand next year in European Parliament elections.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car lockup at home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had repeatedly locked up against a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel on Thursday.
Inspector Bob Blemings said that damage was done to the gates and the building itself was done.
A crossbow may also have been shot at the car at some point.
Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston guarantees victory
Advanced Livigston astounded Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose was proof of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without a away and next week faced the forerunners Heart, who were ahead of their eight points.
Rangers are only host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europaliga.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded their unconquered laps in the division to six games, with chief coach Holt who still didn't taste a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses odds against bot visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead long before they had recorded a purpose, with their bristledness which Rangers had brought on all kinds of problems.
SR broke through but wore in front of the hall, then AL could play just wide after he got closer and met CH’s headguard across the mark.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with deadlock moments.
And thus came the decisive purpose.
Rangers lost a freehead and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and mark a target from the middle of the frame.
By then Rangers dominated but could not penetrate the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was deprived by the feet of Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow had tapped far to escape the open game of Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two penalties were turned away after Halkett’s challenge of replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Femenal' by Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent, they still exceed expectations on this upward track.
Their game style and manship have been almost unchanged since their return to first class, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense arrangement while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as they could at times under Gerrard, they could not uphold those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a alarm for Rangers, who found them in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
Saturday (29 September) saw smiles and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a failure on issues that included human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurds – also dictated their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The warring demonstrations reflect the disunity of a visitor who is greeted as hero by some German Turks and who is extolled by others as autocrats.
Deptford road accident: Bicycler dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-step on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and notify his close relatives.
Road closures and bus detours were recommended instead, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injury Injury
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's penitentiary, said the penitentiary.
Resurrection broke out about 09:30 BST on Sunday and was still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" were called to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been developed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible for the police will be referred to and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder in which billiard - ball personnel were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Dreg Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfluge (Dreogtegebiete Trekk Dalk Favor)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but that's exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings instant flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix, and will approach late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noticed in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Com, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside instant flood risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, of this rainfall will probably be beneficial, since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s path leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane - strong Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, so her power is waning.
So it is expected that on Monday in the afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico, she will reach the country.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Falls of rain from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible,"weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north over Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening rapid floods and debris in the deserts and land faults in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys A 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at about 4:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what has happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered under the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday and fervently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed about her claim during the trial.
The president said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, is a voice to confirm one of the most qualified legal spirits of our time, a case with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while he was talking about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian tremor, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were dead and many had washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach on Friday for a festival on the beach when burners had broken from up to six feet (18 feet) high at sundown on the beach, many had washed away after their death and destroyed all that was in the way.
The tsunami followed after a 7.5-range earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy doing their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it struck everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air pictures released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks were still shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluations and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s huge kudding was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sat at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have made the size of the tsunami worse, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake shark.
Communication "is totally disabled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning had been issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, it can be heard how a man on the top floor of a building screams desperate warnings about the coming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water strikes the beach and drags buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not accurately explain the image material.
The tremor and tsunami caused major power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but outcasts still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport is only reopened for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where employees were hiding in deck shelters erected in their office’s courtyard, they were passing scenes of devastation, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin the terrible task of starting the disaster relief task, some have complained that foreign assistants are being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and overseas personnel can only get started after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it doesn't yet have a status."
At the dawn of the second evening on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad story of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
Sunday rescuers rescued a woman for two days under rubble was trapped with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian national parachute team, trained two of the missing parachute weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media under the parachute society, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were only answered with one gray stamp, instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $2,750 while refilling OTM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $2,750 from a Brink's worker who had refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car driver was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind the Brink's employee and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Faster changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that had canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio-supplier Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It was from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known, among other things, as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West worker, JAY-Z, has also come up with or without a link sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza to "never ever use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where as many as 300 people died at a time when left-wing student movements throughout Latin America had taken root.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training brought youth to gangs.
US needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even if the US is short a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year China announced its plan: by 2030 they were aiming to be the No. 1 in AI innovation.
"Dubbel the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding can double the chances that the next major AI performance in the U.S. will be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest rated American Otello player and later he was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee gave recognition to previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years appointed influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the US AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD's in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued its next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Ceur Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in election or change country name
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that their northern neighbor's name represents a requirement in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavonic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has sowed doubt as to whether the attendance will meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum letter read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price that could be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that came about from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live free under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means safer lives for all of us, Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State election commission said that by 1 p.m., there were no reports of immoderateness.
But the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko are voting for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small loft and drew chairs in front of tents prepared by those who went to the referendum boikot.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favor of it, for more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he had cast his voice.
He said a "yes" rash would be "confirming our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, attendance should be 50 percent plus one voice.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his 65th - minute goal.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine goalhead received an ad at the middle field.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before he struck the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target.
He then pushed an ad to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English foreteller used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back for Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Brighton target guard Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that at that moment he has recorded a purpose."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some touch before leading Sterling to the farthest goal.
The Sky Blues foretold kicking the ball in the net just before he was over the backline.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil Rockies
With the Nationals out of the game, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to attack the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playing implications for the Rockies, which has a one-game edge over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a promoter choice with a 5-2 win over the National Friday evening, but still wanted to tie their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point of me this year will stare in the face.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favorable to have Scherzer cast into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a throw- training session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-sunday.
The Washington Legal is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 halls in 220 2/3 seconds this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I'm fighting for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump has continued, 'One sees this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take power back by any possible way; one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, about whom they must walk to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we won't give it to them."
Democratics, he said, is on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democrats "wrong and mean and geniusy and false."
He referred to the name Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received severe bonds from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Have you had the document leaked out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting one – it was really poor body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Labour party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerance to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Workers' Party LP's to whom it was said we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, that was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendliness, more gracious" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It became increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks, began to expect me to make a U turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there is a tyrade of abusive speech on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core and to tell me that I should not be in the Workers' Party.
And not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed toward me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a deluge of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and that I will be "oukei."
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect which literally abandoned my state high school school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that is sending down on a Brexit that is going to damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party at that time: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being reelected or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have pulled the final results slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned to triumph in this wonderful and entertaining Tennant's Premiercy game of the day.
They are now at the top of the score doctrine, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team, and trainer Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested so far in our competitions and we're still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Honor Ayr, they have taken their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, intended by Frazier Climo, caused Ayr to be ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers counted and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's lead with a penitentiary just before he, just before rest, meant a solo three to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, referred to by Baggot, reduced the residue to five points.
There was a long stop for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried on a portable, and from the restart Ayr enlarged the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, referred to by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unexpected three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return, and when Struan Hutchinson had got a yellow card because he had killed Climo without the ball, and from the penitentiary MacPherson had pushed the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr-lost.
Climo made that point, just as he had almost done from the restart, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal and sent off flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-star seems to be starting a new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game-ster is going to move to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he has been designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays along with old comedy pilot Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the coming ninth season would be the final of the program, and Kirunn seemed to be preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source suggested at the Scottish Sun that Kirunn wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "floating restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': land-rounded Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific
Sailor patrol a mascot-covered fleet quarries in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are fitted with the slogan: "The sea is really ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the surrounding Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline that they lost in a bloody resource conflict to Chile in the 19th century is still fresh – just the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH Pronunciation on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year – also has many who depend on Monday’s decision.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's judgment came only six months to the last appeals shows that the matter "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s cause, it may have slowed down in the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was taken by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric captivated any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions again at one point, but it will be enormously difficult to have nad discussions.
The two countries had not exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extraordinarily rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust U.S.A.
North Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival countries' leaders.
His remarks follow to U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo evidently on the brink of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, over three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a dream image that will bring the North on its knees as well.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of large head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or turn off the sun completely, you do not have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of lavish major covers at their SS19 collection on the treadboard that captivated the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Extremely impractical hats roamed Instagram this summer, and these designers paraded their amazing creations on the treadboard.
The excelling by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the heads of the models.
Other great additions included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a sorcerer hat and even a pineapple – but it was not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had worked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation seemed like scuba equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another seemed like a melted ice-cream horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Stylishers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hat follows shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge that was seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the most impractical hat that was spread over the social scene sent another great creation over the treadboard – a straw-beach bag that was almost as large as the swim pants-dressed model it wore.
The burned orange raffiasak, finished with raffiafraiings and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera' SS19 collection at Paris Fashionweek.
Well-known stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in shops for next summer – since the designer had made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized extravagant.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a cracking achievement of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages obtained a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 membership schools, showed that 72 percent of students had obtained a higher degree A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Professionals and Skills Commission found in 2014 that some of the reasons employees provide why they are struggling to fill posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically place above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and was French the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s children’s language education is so important now.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot at this point, in a global business environment, be denied that languages are still enormously important for the country's future, and therefore must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages really need to be viewed as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will make a debut on Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for adherents to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers-trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play in San Diego in Sunday's opening-up game against the Denver Nuggets.
But just how many minutes he is going to play remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has gone on to know that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-seasonal games at this point in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a wave of election assemblies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled additions the next week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmative voice currently held back for his choice to fill the high court vacancies, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming interelection because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voted in November.
What time is Trump's contraction in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online at it?
Trump's contraction in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
Below you can see Trump's contraction in West Virginia via live current.
Trump will probably give attention to this week's trials for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over accusations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated confirmation voice held back for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that the following week these five additions were aimed at "visual volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Management of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, to Reuters.
This evening's rally, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter into Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams from Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Rider Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is a completely fabricated sport concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and another twelve that are played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the base to the clean field and guided by his example.
Those scoring celebrations became louder as his round progressed and he sunk a critical set to win four completely equal while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
His sethold who won the contest at 15 for them was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to take everything out and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That is all those players now have left.
18 pieces to print off their stamp.
The only players with more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the questionable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s few but charming couples got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only few who had not recorded one on Saturday afternoon on job numbers, but they also avoided one on Saturday morning on job rates as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That runway, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players who need to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Choose both at the same time and at different dots.
It is too early, however, to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps on track and two doubles on the front nine the Spaniard and the Sweed ended up in a hole from which they could not even come.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from nearby because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into an instant.
So far, Europe has always played better as a team and took the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the US team had the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, had doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after having come out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game games with an advantage of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that did not match in the morning's four-balls, so that they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. has more resistance in the four - game games and won two games, but it has not made them shrink.
Jim Furich’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend are called "Moliwood", are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to win a Dad Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--which is first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always get their way on a pleasant day with a windy southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a big tournament and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two pieces.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder cup, a team recovered from arrears of four points when they entered the single game, even though Fureich's team just had to play evenly to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
After having been second best for two days, however, it does not seem that they will manage a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll definitely not. Unarmed one-sidedly.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that continued downfalls are worsening their distrust of the United States and that the country will by no means give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such traits.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken significant goodwill measures, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear testing site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons by which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual action, his words seemed significant by not rejecting unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjongang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim made a commitment to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pjongang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to slow down strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The persepsia that sankies can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued downfalls make our distrust worse."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader earlier in the week at the United Nations focused attention.
Rather, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue on the destruction of nuclear weapons were South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed at the U.S. land mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "fireman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea "all in all," praised Kim abundantly for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that a lot of work still needs to be done and that sanktities still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Thursday, told the UN Security Council that "applying sanctions by the Security Council must be zealous and without letup until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an effort to get funding for Pjongang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs dried up.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said that he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea only hours later accused him of having made " gang-like demands."
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also to take a nuclear complex as the United States "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course over enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its pre-graduate students to sleep more in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of study by working out caffeine driven 'all-night sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant when it concerns the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep withdrawal on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was--that surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one department there is a picture of a dormitory, where students on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books must click to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another department, participants are told how long-term sleep reduction can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'study all night' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep withdrawal puts the brain in a starving mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after having walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' that electronic screens and LED lights radiate, which may disturb your circadian rhythm and may cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquers Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another sarsie of day-to-day heart injury when Dolly Menga's target-head Steven Gerrard's incoherent team got a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just given Gerrard his second defeat in 18 races as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, who had gone loose in front of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would seem to play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is on purpose only behind Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team who stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 who took a point from Heart last week and he would have been in his cunts with the way his well-trained team suffocated their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated balm, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, after just two minutes, they must have scored points when Menga’s first deposit passed on Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle field player got his big chance open.
A deep escape by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensemate Alan Lithgow could only miss at the back end.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have gotten a penalty goal at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson turned away the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Colibaly's head shot and a domestic targethead of Oviedo Ejaria.
While at the 34th minute, Livi’s opener may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coolhead and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly drove from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgov and Halkett who had long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their edge in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come far from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penitentiary when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERY ... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: 'Good, it's cracking about now!'
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name survives.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robber cells
Dust teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can see a protein 'see' which is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test chemical shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change them into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump speech after acting on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was looted in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an outstretched act in which he believed the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would make himself preferred in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he rang out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk to a white man so often and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a race?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the image material of West’s insult was loaded on social media by comediant Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the platform about what he was wearing on his head.
"They handcuffed me behind the stage.
They said, 'Do not go out with that hat on.'
They shackled me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead, "Would you like to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment attracted at least twice a publishing from the audience and members of the SNL roll distribution seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: "The whole studio has become silent."
West was introduced as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhyme dresser Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of TPUSA conservation group, Candace Turner, who was whistling: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKY THAT YOU WANT TO BE THE SCARE."
But chatter program hostess Karen Hunter had been whistling that West was merely "who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") which I believe I accept and proclaim an ideology that endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme claddinger announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature that was once known as Kanye West."
Not the first artist to change his name, he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-Rymkletzer, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder of knife-steering in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East-Belfast with a knife on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The charge will be revised by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword - swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he said 'something went wrong' and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his companion from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about making this issue work.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we men learned as they grow up in relation to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time. How do we change it?
Because something evidently went wrong with our young men."
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones-procedures and follow-up documents when the series came to an end next summer, for he said he was 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
Since November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-conquered fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, representing a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased with 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to make the matter work.
Maxine Waters denied that a staff member had GOP senators' data leaked, condemned 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters expropriated Saturday against claims that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultra right" experts and Web sites.
"Lying, lying, and still detestable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Karolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing on the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed High Court Board Board Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Poundit and RedStates reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the placements was related to Waters' office and made the information of a member of Waters' staff known, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information and security was put at risk as a result of this deceptive and false claim--was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly aroused online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of apparently being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to raise Waters from the pillows in the middle election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive claims.
"We'll make sure that the managers are exposed," she continued, "and that they'll be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - faint Rowan Atkinson spioenspottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impact and it seems applicable to this resurgence of the Johnny English action comedy mockery ranchise - which then began with Johnny English in 2003 and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-chosen evenitarians be on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new execution event?
In any case, the inconspicuous Johnny English with its bulging and rubber face has renewed his license to waste everything for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance a bit from Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good scout of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor garment and cut the screws briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed but the humor feels rather faint and strangely superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy with self-confidence as a component.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent - film greetings in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the distress of the agent in service--a sad little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and besieged character, who already experiences a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy is at risk, she must call someone out of his retirement.
And this means the struggling Johnny English itself, now serving as a teacher at some fancy institution, but which from the record gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a school of rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-amaptic role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are all of it in her Majesty's secret service to completely waste everything in service and come to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury rope hunt; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a lot like children's TV.
Pretty mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to justice?
Labour deny that it's a plan for British to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week--but be paid for five days.
The party is said to want company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution to be transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources says that it will fit the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in favor of the workers.
To change to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior worker party source told The Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first one to support such an idea, with the Green Party who, during his campaign for the general election in 2017, promised a four-day work week.
At present, however, the ambition is not supported by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to exude about his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'visitless directors' and 'winners' at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back, since a workers' government can make deductions on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private - sector businesses to employees, who can obtain annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote about his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could deepen anything that could change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Karolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, and that accusation came true, and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was determined, certainly, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have shaped my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Board has zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new changing."
What is the World Citizens ’ Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars acting and having an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens ’ Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the occasion’s real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international interlocutory group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way of creating awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was World citizen with 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism"--people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twit?
Since 2011, World citizen says that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers that is committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after having received more than 4,700 twigs from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition-ambasseur Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
answered World citizen: "It will be a long and hard road--at times we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-parliamentary movements before us, we will succeed, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who act in New York on this year's occasion, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleet for "blockage" to prevent exports of Russian energy - Minister of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could leave on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from getting into the market, including the Middle East, the US Minister of the Interior has revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zincs claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the legal government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zincs addressed the residents of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit hunt that considers themselves the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran, noting that they were practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "single-talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason the Trump administration's officials, including America's President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump Berlin makes Moscow's "prisons".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of performing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked counterreaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the U.S. to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider it "seriously" to stand as president in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts's senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would consider it "seriously" to stand as president to the mid-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman on the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren gave her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said, "Take the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very pronounced in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twit Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI examination before our voice."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the Senator didn't stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent who supported the idea that he should be potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Praying said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who sense the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers return," she told an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and District Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the county filed a friend-of-the-court law order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions dispute filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She said her mate, "and his violent gang boys," abused her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces a large number of US-based applicants, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that fled from domestic violence.
District Columbia's attorney-general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores the state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court law order.
Advocates have further argued in the legal order that the policy that immigrants refuse to access, damages the US economy, and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will provide "necessary labour."
In June, attorney general Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of policy on June 11.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems — even all serious problems — that face people all over the world every day.
Desperate Rescues in Palu while Deadness Doubles in Race to Find Survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nagging.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while consoling her fevery baby boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, looking for drenched possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-range tremor, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had contracted a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he told of the violent earthquake which shook the fifth-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruins, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accused China of 'punishment' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertising in an American daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the U.S. Ambassador to China Beijing accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily’s paid bet in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s newspaper with the most sales – after accusing China of intervening in the U.S. Congress elections of November 6, a complaint that China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in a growing campaign through Washington was to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to their par excellence rounds being levelled at each other's imports.
China’s early retribution in the trade war was designed to beat exporters in such states as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now annoying the bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing very limited divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people have about China's alarming economic trajectory, giving that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has shy away from the offer to publish its article", although he has not said which paper.
Republicans alienate women's voters for intermediate elections with Kavanaugh debakel, warns analysts
While many top-republics stand at Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see counter-reaction during the upcoming inter-elections, especially of women.
The emotions about this are enormously high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s incentive for an FBI investigation on the nipper would be enough to appease severe voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning protesters "November is on their way!" roaring as they argued in the Senate entrance gym while the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among swung-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who do not often vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony that sets out the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominated, analysts said a counter-reaction may follow if Republicans continue to confirm.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a little more taking the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say that they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely joged during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s incitement, the FBI is now examining the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed last week under oath before the Senate Legal Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated his genitals to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the fight
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches an initial business trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Interrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that the idea with Interrupt was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and in one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, developers on the staff who are contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Interrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the introduction of a total change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a positioning on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to supply both commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he is running Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am tremendously optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoriakreuz-spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, from 29 September 1918 lt.kol. led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin Channel "by very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the fire line and with the "greatest braveness" led the line forward before he stormed a field gun alone and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German sniper – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "something I know I can never live up to, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath to the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feel honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just not to be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the U.K. night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were left stupid when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the battle until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some other sick joke."
"It's government regulations that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator-Company's President Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the remission, I think we can probably figure out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it turned over, there were many text messages that were sent back and forth and it was not all kind.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and have just gone over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had aired his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that to become a parent, made him care less about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months from illness.
When he appeared as a baffling on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, for "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less than, and feel different, the real things that have given me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's State Bond games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has aired his feelings because he is so happy to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – " caught him on the side."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a matter.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died three years later on from cancer – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The couple had become parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 – for he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my life over – to dive in front of my home at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – that also resonated with him in building up to the Olympics and still giving him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not drift and withdraws on Saturday's Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider Cup match, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played for a record-12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furich for Saturday's four-ball games and four-digits.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time major winner will divide his day between being a race leader and working on the practice berth on his game hoping to correct what matters.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long roughfield always punishes the erring blows.
And as if the course on its own was not challenging enough, Mickelson came up in his ninth game on Sunday against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who joined with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s competition can be absolutely essential.
Furich expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role which he had today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he'll be right tomorrow," said Furich.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Held Hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think that he would play two games.
I had more in store, but that is how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most Rider Cup games.
It can mark the end of a Rider Cup career that never really corresponded to the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halves, although Furich said that his presence contributed untouchable aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to shave the fool, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 competition at Valderrama, where the team under the direction of Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but only nailed with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we had won navel collar," said Bjorn, in the photo, after he watched how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 before at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going full - speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoicing how his players set foot on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of another colour.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that's taking place, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to deliver to players, getting the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furich would want his players to do better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furich himself had been reversed on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended as loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 braved his players on his way to that last day.
"We've got 12 major matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to move in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those midgames.
We set up our team accordingly and divided the men we felt, you know, to bring us tomorrow something magical."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and faced Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I've chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Rescheduled
The German army's latest frigate would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-kurant who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-Class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a battle order of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missions as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships – which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become outdated by the time they enter into service called Die Zeit.
Last year, the disastrous F125 frigate struck when the German Navy officially refused to hire the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a ship builder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return mission, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is unfolded in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also found that the ship was dramatically overweight, reducing the performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project – including the crew training – also raised a question.
It apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that the new frigates have bitten become especially important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy's "ships that can be unfolded are getting lost."
As time went by, the official said, the issue worsened, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were supplied.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bat as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Invereven Garden in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to search for bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert client channels of all recordings will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservationist for NTS hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of such habitat management as pasture creation and how to best manage forest land for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have fallen significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly record and perform dormitory inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Three estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of bat.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Three we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the need to look for bats before conservation in property is done because it is possible that unwitting destruction of a single birthplace can mean up to 400 females and young children's death and an entire local population can be eradicated.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and to many of our species we don't know how their populations do."
Ronaldo makes rape claims while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus forerunners were accused of raped an American woman, named Kathryn Mayora, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a Instagram live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player smilingly added.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral compensation for any amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayora reportedly went to the player's room, where he was said to have raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo after the alleged incident fell down on his knees and said he was "99 percent" an "good old" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had at the hospital pictures of her injuries taken, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "fang for revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants the settlement reversed because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged assault about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and moved this summer, in a $100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will lose 'everlasting repentance' if their car manufacturers
The UK 'will forever repent' if they lost their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "competent" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily have to stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a gene agreement-Brexit, could cost posts.
Last year, the Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have aired fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their mini-plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" base, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be discontinued.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only the current success but for us to seize this occasion," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that in the long term, added costs could reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's convoy at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back again.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein can be "rescheduled by another week" while the fight on nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election interference, links between Trump-helpers and Russia, and possible cross-bombing of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is going to dismiss the deputy attorney general or not, and by doing so threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has been inflamed for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying an recorder to talk to Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the account.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "chosen not to give up" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate Court trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it can be this week, I can see that it will be postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are "effect hunting," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they're effective hunting."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly for the president of the United States questions, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press statements are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and at times, bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and express the wish that they would continue to go to Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also intensified their preparations for a possible gene agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I prize each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' liner Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he had contracted a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodore, Tennessee-span's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and sort of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no details yet about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was moved from Illinois in his first season at Tennessee State.
On Saturday, he took to death five times before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 dead vessels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to draw young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasure expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to draw young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The added tax – which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasure expects this move to bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London pendulums are purchased by non-UK citizens who raise prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp taxes to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices high by picking up land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to give up quotaes on affordable homes to repair Britain's "domestic disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no error-outs".
He also wants to give gears greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And this means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign - based companies to buy houses as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at one point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
This summer he moved to the stadium of Light after leading back to the Scottish Premiercy last season St Mirren.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child, I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that pulls me back.
The occasion can only come, however, if I am successful with club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa athletic boss said he felt no fear of following such established names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''Can I have this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out of there again."
Ross's career in the board was only three years long, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' train staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and St Mirren from on the brink of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he remembered how he had taken over Alloa's leitations.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things to come weekly.
I’m still going through it with regard to the stress and pressures of the work, but driving is just right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the full interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7% in July, but restaurants received 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to the previous month, June, when drinking places were up with 2.8 percent, besides restaurants being hit even heavier.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drunkie-led drinking places and bars did far better and rose more than restaurants had dropped.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Around managed bars and drinking places sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sports events remains the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the out-of-the-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a downturn in sales of 4.8 percent years per year will be particularly difficult above and beyond constant expenses.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowness in brand - brand notices.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have hidden secret social media accounts from their parents and teachers, revealing a survey
Recording of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news raised fears that sexual content should be placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep their secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram photo fair.
The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who urged others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot locate them."
Eilith Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish athletic board
Eiligh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching international experience during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic society and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 games in Atlanta among his four golden Olympic medals, was now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having had a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it has fully recovered, learned again how to walk, and practice dexterity exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising that mothers compare with cows split opinions online
A breast pump company has distributed opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast - feeding mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the execution of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-piece music video-inspired advertisement to display the freedom the pump gives to mothers who milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I carry out the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused Online contention.
With 77,000 eyes and hundreds of remarks, the video received mixed reaction from viewers, with many saying that it underplays the "grumbles" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
We need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie brush pump fits discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person observed: "I understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screams."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had still breast - feeding.
To milk out made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another noticed: "It's a nice advertisement directed at mothers who feel milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "cows".
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a nourishment that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a big and evocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the limelight, while in an entertaining way where people can join the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the walkway for designer Martha Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp camp on the Texas border
The number of maintained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of fierce rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be put at risk by moving forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adult members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albumence, a senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement in front of Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to bail out unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or household members of bails are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albumce.
In an effort to speed up the processing of the children, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelterers.
Many will appear through video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who are unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many already have to contend with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupiers' to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moulem, who also serves as Deputy First Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian grounds, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "handled in accordance with this."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more millions who have been uprooted, "almost over".
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until we had cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moulem said that the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to fascinate these returnees," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should simply be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last large rebel fortress of Idlib, has given an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear delays" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front that would be "cut off".
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "the examination of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump will win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals early end his presidency.
In what no doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak-time viewers, on of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top-up cable viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "For he made me laugh," Slovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the Washington story lines can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and reunite the health of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather flight jacket ("a garment thick of the hubris", said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"In part, what he does makes it feel like a reality program, is that he carries you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, head of business of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's fluctuating roll distribution and daily twists in the plot (such as looking for quarrels with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un to praise).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scales.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs back then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it now seems they were right."

External money streams to the most exciting mid-term selection competitions in House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw a flow of money, due to a shift of congress districts that two officials now had in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who has won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decreed that the old districts were unconstitutionally defined in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th cut off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field Force's Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Force Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a navel crab win in a wide-held special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S.A. has considered penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then retreating back
Diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the government departments decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were considered only against El Salvador who in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in American aid, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include a reduction in financial assistance and excessive visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively bringing an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new heavy messages or rigours from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an out-of-analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that may happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible over-bombing of justice, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also thought to focus his investigation on whether Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in the country’s attack on our elections.
If the Congress would pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body, just when he was preparing to go back in front of the voters, and perhaps finally in front of a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axes, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – and not that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West had just opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy’s relentless course is being rushed or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested taking the president in secret and speculating on whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times ’ report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the election for a congress that will hold Trump responsible for him?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who at one time lived in my ambassadors' house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.
With that as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna game
Rangers play on Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equinox in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2-equivalent outcome against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this rash as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the contest with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but a draw is probably a just outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got out in the second half, and we were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game, because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there's now a feeling-of-good factor in the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, sit behind us last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep over this retirement - saving fear of money
Despite the fact that recording participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to care for them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to determine where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term insurance fund decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down conflicts at the pace.
Get a health care proxy instead so that you designate a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts fulfill your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are in question, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What Is the Medication?
Who Will Care for the Dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a wind box when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an "equivalent act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communication put out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu closer to the center of the 7.5-range tremor.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The government, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province’s economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times during the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific’s Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great tremor along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors struck the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was hit most populated island, which led to a tsunami that struck the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-size tremor struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: a 7.5-size tremor struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat tremor struck the Pdie Jaya regime in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly tremor and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 died from buildings that had crashed,
2018: Great tremors hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The tremor destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su's hearing facility and is held on a $500 unsecured deposit, reports KTU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decisive" when asked what he was pleading, reported the network.
Palin stares three classes of A infringements in the face, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently serving before Alaska Veterane court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-range earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered together for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to cut down pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" administered serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "mighty planning and premeditation," said prosecutors and described the way Saipov carried it out as "abominable, cruel and perverted".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hern Ferruchi, Hernn Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stated the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the South District of New York legally persecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug providers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced for a plot to carry out spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were tendered with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "of course disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL VARAGE should be put in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by now the UK would be "out" as Mr. Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces is to unite her deeply distributed officers by applying pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan under attack from Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Alliances insisted that she would push door in her attempt to make an agreement with Brussels despite the deadlock – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Means Loop-convention in Solihull that he wanted to exterminate Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in control, by now we would have been out,' he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to eject Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said, "We did not fight world wars to be in subjection.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone has rejected suggestions that since the 2016 vote, public opinion has changed: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally false.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘ I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombarding the streets and making sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: 'First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farge told us that the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold to want to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a matter of confidence between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
'We mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the introduction of the group this weekend.
Arbeidman Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
'It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a total trick.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to 'look hard at it' to stand for president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "look hard at it to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that she may challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A stranger asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in Shot Death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect in LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University’s campus.
"Wayed Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and was finally killed as a result," told police chief Murphy J. Paul the media via 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, owned by a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 younger person who grew up in Baton Rouge played Sims in 32 games with 10 lead last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 football balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton crowns world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel went first into the wells and left Hamilton to drive into traffic at the back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes got a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead to wheel-on-wheel action which the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free saw the inside leaving on danger of endurance to a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back of the runway grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held on to his tires to get ready quickly and to cross Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th round but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had been fantastic all weekend and was a real sir.
The team did outstanding work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a convention on Saturday about her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not address directly the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it...No, we didn't lick it," he added, in an occurrence of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that explained the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, reporting to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial good and commented during Saturday evening’s convention: "I tell you what, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominated accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the democratic use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who hurts them, who should drive them to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-purpose lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team equal before Dwyer recovered the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee evenly before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keepe’s men who lost first contests and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's prom came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaul aid, with David Rutherford who offered the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan put the home team back in play on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Despite this, the Giants took direction into the first break when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard found them once again with a power game target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the contest late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are at home to Milton Keynes in their next contest on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to make sure hundreds on airplane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that an airplane that carried hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake on Friday the island of Sulawesi had hit, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But in spite of his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gwachan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that had swung badly at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he was tumbling together day after day.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster - dealing agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still elevated since many corpses are still under the construction traps while many cannot yet be reached," said agent spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that had reached to six meters, Palu plucked, which would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is pursuing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military service: "I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia aircraft accident: Air Niugini says one man is missing after lagoon aircraft accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific ocean lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn't account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they work with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact succession of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to walk through medium - deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airmen got panicked and shouted and that he had contracted a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships working close to improving a quay also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people to land again and again before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in the last two decades in the collapse of PNG-registered airlines, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts detail timeline of evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case on Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different cell phones that showed that Tellis was together Chambers on the night of her death, which was in contradiction with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's move that night, Sanford said he was "joke, for my move was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He sure made her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin his closing pleas on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and the approach to social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hops popular again.
Artists like The Fuges and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
NY-children's virgins sue couple because she was fired to "racist" text
A New York Children's Lady sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she had received a wrong addressed message from the mother who complained that she was another black person.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the suit with " extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her distress when she found out that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first workday in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEE NEVER A SWART PERSON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent me Maurice twice.
After she found out her fault, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that their outgoing nanny who was African-American did bad work and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his compensation up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple turned to the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a race.
We're not racist people," man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, though it was by a tube?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with " extortion" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the court of public opinion was still continuing, the court of public opinion was quick to apply the couple to social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not link readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been fiery if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was last year "bitter sweet".
About Paddington, whom she described as an "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't an appley man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if man had a child who had accomplished something: you are proud of them, even if it wasn't your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success kind of in that way.
Even though he was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart beat was slowly getting out and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurt for the loss of her daughter, accompanied the other passengers on board the plane--unwittingly appreciated the trial she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head lowered and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning Women Mail Cards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at age 18.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said that her son was a promising shef with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you should talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, has lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It rips a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But all of us must go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still firm as FBI is under investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for--a timeless investigation that had no specifications--could we perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan congregated.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to have the FBI investigate?
Their reluctance is all because of timing.
The intermediate elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to find the man they would prefer to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley who was Mr. Bush ’ personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has delivered his report?
There will be a voting party in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 voices on the Senate floor that Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow to break a draw and confirm himself to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overflowing numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has said.
Park Byeong-pig quoted data from the South’s Unification Cabinet and said that there were 1,127 overlaps last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of overflows from the North are finally offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights via China, which have the longest border with North Korea, are easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zones (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina considers the overflowers to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, who are still technically at war with one another, have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that focused around the dramatic negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN general meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerically", he says incompetently serving at the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-designated Board Kavanaugh "histerically" and said that he was temperately incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they'd say 'histerically'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate-Law Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and suffocated while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also specifically condemned democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "proud and coordinated character assassination", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against democrats.
"I think he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he had been confirmed, and if democrats won the majority in the Lagerhuis.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not competent to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in court on which he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Association Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Act on Costable Care or Roe v. Wade since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh passed questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she cried when she had become angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she had become angry and started to cry, she would have said to the person she had spoken to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for brim because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office was where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed at my neck skin by an older woman--a cold driver I was a bit afraid of--who dragged me into a coachroom.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the race, I was greatly frustrated, realizing that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with fundraisings and so she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overcome by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than parts, and angry for sexism--that she suffocated.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder reminded me about how the press had responded to her.
"You would have thought that Klenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the US China Trade War may be good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the US and China was overwhelming and while the struggle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most interesting escalation has rolled in with new rates that affect $200 trillion (£150 trillion) of items and effectively burdened half of the goods that come into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods each time and has recently clap rates of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
Shina has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to comply publicly with US requests will be too much of an embarrassment to Xi Jinping, Shina's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure over U.S. trade war over the long-term Shina can be positively supported by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic toll flight can begin in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the land which was destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the beaten land.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that guaranteed the invasion.
Europe Seals Ryder Cup Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and team U.S.A. with a final point of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-hou plowed in the water at the par-3 16th hole and admitted his contest to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5–0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2 and 1 to land Poulter from England who may have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad, so glad to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot John Ram, who won US golfy Tiger Woods 2&1 in single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder-beker record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. struggled all weekend to find the cleanfield with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furich spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team, "I'm proud of these guys.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We deleted it.
Guard against Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
Keep your hat slanted.
We're superior."
