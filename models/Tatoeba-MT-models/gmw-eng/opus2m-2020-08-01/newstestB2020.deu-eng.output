Fire extinguished in French chemistry
The big fire in a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the north of French town of Rouen is deleted. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. No one was injured during the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 extinguishers.
The Fire Can Stop It
Anrainers were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people work in the factory. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when a leak released the gas methanethiol in 2013 and the surrounding area smoked after lazy eggs. After an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system in 2015.
Woman quits her job to look for 57 days for her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days were missing from the dog's every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King said to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hundin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner panicked dog
In the hope that Katie could stay at the hotel somewhere else, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four and four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, weeks were coming. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed."
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man came in and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared again. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her bitch under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, according to the words "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shot ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases it is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" scale.
Weapons and ammunition disappear again and again at the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 shot ammunition. This results from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 shot ammunition have been re-appeared. The weapons and parts of weapons that have disappeared are, among other things, six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 type rifles, four G36 type guns, six P8 signal guns, and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of the loss of arms and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "fearing", said the left-wing member of the federal government Martina Renner. This was all the more so, as there was hardly anything found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "low balance". Renner criticised that the list did not show whether the ambiguity of the ammunition was the same as that found in connection with the investigations against the terrorist-suspected federal defense officer Franco A.. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker Stena Impero left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Sena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As the ship observation data of Refinitiv showed, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was named as the target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. It was said from the shipping company that one wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
On July 19th, the "Stena Impero" had been accused of infringing security regulations by the Iranian Revolution Guards on Hormuz Sea Road. However, Iran was suspected of reacting to the controversial, temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to the UK.
Hormuz road is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have worsened in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel honours the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who went to the streets 30 years ago in the Früchtlich Revolution. In autumn 1989 courageous citizens would have brought the GDR regime into swing, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thüringer CDU Group on the upcoming day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor reminded us of the occupation of the Stasi Central. "State security was taken from terror," she said.
Musk seeks extradition record
Teslas's quarter may have record. Despite the extradition boom, there were last losses at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 extras", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could record 110000 orders, it was also stated in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strongly the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit figures will have to be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral brain prevents people from tickling themselves. This was found by scientists from Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments at rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question of why children are so strongly opposed to the tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the approach of a tickling hand caused laughter before the touch. This was due to a deep layer in the cerebral brain, which already triggered the laughter when waiting for the sickle.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "Laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laughing" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Smile is suppressed during self - touch
So far it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - so people cannot tickle themselves. However, the researchers in Berlin now found out in the experiments at the rats that the laughter and activity of the area of the cerebral cortex in question are being suppressed during a self-contact. This is also true if living beings themselves clean. However, during the foreign touch and the tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and impulse has been increased.
But if the self-contact and the touch of others pass through at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-contact and the touch of others. The new findings suggest that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the cerebral brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment they broke off this initiation in advance, showed escape behaviour or terror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kitten is a behavioural reaction that is similar in rats and humans.
Averted Catastrophe: Big fire in French chemical plant deleted
The big fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in Rouen, Northern France, was removed. This was reported by the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out in the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no harmful substances should have been released. The samples taken do not give any cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was hurt during the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by her own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament after the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without any agreement from the EU on 31 October should not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement, but it is unclear how he wants to achieve this.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who had been committed to Britain's stay in the European Union, "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to re-establish this country would be to withdraw the EU." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Memorial to the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial is revealed in Norway on Saturday in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They recall the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the Cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. The opening is expected among others, crown prince Haakon and crown princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first lit a car bomb in the Oslo government district and, following the island of Utöya, killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not solve any problem in the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Sena Impero" held in Iran could get back into the lake. It could be a piece of puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Sena Impero", which has been held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now driving, among other things, for medical research in Dubai, Reederreichf Erik Hånell. At noon, the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," stated a communication on Friday.
The Iranian revolutionary guards had set the tanker on July 19 under the accusation of disregarding the rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and challenging situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Sena Impero". At the beginning of July, a super tanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, had been placed on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery was against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The reference to the ship had received the British from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Presumptuously, it had been an exchange business to get the "Sena Impero" released, as London vehement returned.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have been greatly aggravated in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans reject the Iranian leadership’s intention to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects it. In 2018, the US left the international nuclear agreement alone, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has put pressure on Tehran to lead massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent agreement that is extended to other areas. Iran has been resisting the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Sena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of the merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a "war winner". Given the fines imposed by America's President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic of China are forced to re-dispose. Financial leaders of Asian companies who are considering moving their production from China to another country call India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers India seems to have created as it did to play a more important role in the global production chain.
But now India itself has become Trump's focus. Depreciated from the Haudegen in the White House as "Kingdom of Customs", America removed the emerging country from its 2000 product trading preferences at the beginning of June. The United States prohibitively charge India high tariffs and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the rites with India are, of course, simply a side-shower. America also considers the world’s largest democracy through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s claims for power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American tariffs against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, is therefore expected to weigh in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a heavy status in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. His reform zeal is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic crazyness that has suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-national state for too long. Companies now receive rapid building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more gripping insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for making it seem more quickly liquidating companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has been done for the better in India in the first five modes. However, this does not apply in commercial policy. The national conservative government has even established new barriers to protecting it from foreign suppliers from the lack of international competition.
In the West, the Nimbus of the energetic reformer depends on the economic radical renewal of his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well which vocabulary western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never drifted away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from getting rid of anachronistic processes and thus becoming fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the rejection of their industries are among the tribal voters of Mois nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and claim this short-sighted policy.
Arrest of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris in the next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported by calling on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral was scheduled in the Paris Invalidity, as media reported.
Carrying the competitors into the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the athletics World Championship
The world’s top was already in the finish of the year, when in the down-cooled Khalifa International Stadium, the men’s first advance of 5,000 metres Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to change dangerously. He could hardly stop at the leg 300 meters before the finish, ran in a healthy bent attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him and supported him with the final half- stadium round in the finish. However, the forces were still enough to stop the running watch after the finish. As if the scene had not already been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpectedly drawing the attention of the gathered journalists. He was shy, he didn't want to talk at all about his heroic act. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would be proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Cup. Under normal circumstances, he shouldn't have even started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
That's what he did with emphasis on the evening - and much more intense than he might have thought. Because this heroic act will remain in memory. Especially Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish and took the last place voluntarily - by the way, just five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. At the end it had nothing to do with it, because the busby, with much help, was disqualified precisely because of the end of the world athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, had started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he was still disappointed at 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was: "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millionsmasch: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures were reinforced in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in recent days, the police had reinforced their road controls and pedestrian phones had partially searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two NGOs.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, protests came with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protests against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, living in exile in Spain, who put the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" in central places in the country for today’s Friday. Ali calls for a "people’s revolution". Although for most young Egyptians, the man is not a "good man, because as a subcontractor for the army, he has turned millions, but his messages arrive.
According to two groups of observers, the number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed at first. The government also confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "at random arrested", "only because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," said HRW, referring to lawyers. According to their lawyers, the accusations against the arrested range from "proliferation of misinformation" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces surveyed and searched uniformly, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW figures, as well as arbitrary passersby.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Shipping dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although it is not possible to exempt companies from the turnover tax on property, the Ministry explained that the Green Group had a question of the Green Group of the Media on Friday, which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday. However, the traders could place the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would not have to pay any or little VAT.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens return every sixth package on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - then landed in the trash. According to current legal situation, they would also cost the companies money, because the financial authorities rate donations like a turnover, which then amounts to turnover tax.
Katrin Göring-Eckardt, a Green Group leader, asked Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies are not able to evaluate products for sale and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This was true not only for online commerce, but also for other shops from the fashion shop to the building market.
Banksy Art for Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Deved Parliament", is to be auctioned shortly.
For Branczik, Banksys' work underlines "reformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basics of animals and tribes." As of Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3rd. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million amount.
At the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had recently delivered a severe exchange of views with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons following the withdrawal by Johnson of a forced stop by the Supreme Court. Johnson intends to carry out, if not without agreement with the EU on 31 October, the earlier postponed Brexit on 31 October.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is interfering in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day on their way into the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. Compared to the election campaign in front of the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is "a walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had severely attacked the enemies in the parliament in the past few days and had accused them of, among other things, "treason" against the people. He accused the Members of putting them at risk because they could become the target of murder threats, he turned out to be "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace was if the MEPs finally respected the decision of the British to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that the people had been told that, three years after the referendum, Britain had not left the EU.
In view of the charged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Church of England called for restraint. "We should talk with each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should listen too."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again invited the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at its first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India was likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If this is going badly, one hopes for the best, but is prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region’s autonomy status and thus dramatically increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo call for the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts harshly. With sharp ammunition, it has been shooting at the population, over 2,000 prisoners arrested in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting has never been harmless in Egypt. However, since the takeover of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario such as at the time of Arab Spring.
But one of the triggeres for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectiveness and the feeling of being suffocated by your own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third party lives under the poverty line in Egypt. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who he is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it always becomes critical when large parts of the population have difficulty to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months have been checked to see if the complex plant braid works in the BER fire protection in the interplay. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not finished on the BER yet.
After large-scale Tüv-tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This was certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful examination, but also said that it was still a failure to work out in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured the schedule until the start of the show was still buffered.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should not be too large. The construction notice is now to be submitted to the Bauamt during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of power cables are still to be addressed; the Tüv wants to review them by February. "To create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation here, it is necessary to continue to work intensively on the handling of the defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable tracks hang. The airport manager expects them to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is still not satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke-strikes that are going down when a fire is like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They are going down too far. 36 motors therefore have to be exchanged. Then, at the beginning of the year, there will be new attempts with hot-gas smoke.
Problems with fire protection and further tree failures as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should go into operation in 2011. Costs have risen from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros since the beginning of 2006 to the opening of next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board is scheduled to take place on October 18, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new Managing Directors. Financial Manager Heike Fölster is changing to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Chief of Staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for Drugs ruptured - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and he took a lot of vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the culprit is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket automates in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply. A million damage has been caused!
The police took a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations on the occurrence of explosive explosions in action unit with a particularly severe case of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old confirmed itself."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now has a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the prey he apparently financed his anesthetic dependence." The bomber alone had sprung parking machines on the Bürgerstraße between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomber is now in detention, and the police investigations against him are continuing.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for further automatic sprinklings in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is rethinking its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the competition with low-cost flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed on Friday a press speaker from the Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Biligflieger Eurowings is therefore dissolved de facto. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020 onwards, the AUA will take over the Wetlease, including Eurowings-Personal. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Eurowings Germany will take over routes from Vienna to Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA crossroads and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times will be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the hub Vienna and on the other hand to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serve as a "production company" for the Group's sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to those of Austrian airlines, the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights started under AUA flight number will no longer be completed in Terminal 1, but just like the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna airport, after the Niki-Pleite, a competition for prizes was opened. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna would increase on 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost flyer sent four Ryanair machines, including crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticised the trade union as a circumvention construction for the collective contract.
The battle plan of Ryanair's chief Michael O'Leary, that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years, answered Andreas Otto on Friday, AUA's board of directors: "We'll stay the number one at the site in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Einkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now wed the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italy holidays early month Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped around his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) on Thursday. This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so pleased to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple, who have been together since October 2018 in the official announcement, according to British media reports.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will be very helpful in the coming years, full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken their sister, Princess Eugenie (29) - and also immediately published on their Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will be held in 2020. For more information on date, place and everything else, the palace will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne order and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really causes heart failure or infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to see the causes of cardiovascular diseases more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgesklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich, are involved.
Obesity, smoking, and unhealthy diet are one of the most significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not well known. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the Universitary heart and vascular centre at the UKE.
At present, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-inducing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - and it was said by the clinic. Every year about 200 were added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart disease and heart attack. Data could also be useful in researching other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the Universitary heart and vascular centre. New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancers are possible.
The president of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm desire to use the data to investigate other diseases. So far, the Foundation’s clinic in Davos deals primarily with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine was to be created at the medical campus and a professor of bioinformatics was created. For the reasons of his commitment, the logistics contractor living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bioprobes of healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic. In the case of genetic engineering, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. There is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital Zurich.
Today, according to UKE, a person’s inheritance can be deciphered within 24 hours. The purely physical costs for this amount to 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, have cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to begin on October 1, and all 9000 samples are already to be analysed at the end of 2020.
Nigerian Police Frees Hundreds of Mistreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to local authorities, security forces searched the school in Kaduna, Northern Nigeria, and discovered some of the still minor victims, as police spoke to Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported having been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and being "improved". In fact, the guardians were held by their teachers under "most dignified and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the Koran School, the information has been available for about ten years. Residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They had not been aware of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six staff were arrested according to police.
In the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief plant, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Frees 400 Children From School
Police in a school in northern Nigeria freed almost 400 students from terrible circumstances. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicated torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
On Thursday, the children had been discovered in an Islamic school, where the conditions there were "humane". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all of them boys, were kept in their school like slaves and put on chains. Some were sexually abused. TV shows outraged and injured students in a clearly bad state of health.
World Football Selection: More accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, accusations came from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, much of the Fifa has proved to be a sluggish one: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Cup election has not been suspected of being unfair - if one considers that the voters of national trainers and national team captains of the member associations are often more likely to vote in sympathy than according to objective assessment.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies appear: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
Fifa apologises in so far as "the signatures were given on the electoral forms in capital letters and therefore were not valid". One had contacted the Egyptian association several times in order to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan’s Trainer Also Surprising
There is also a cry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation is understandable in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the same way as it was finally appreciated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was just as received, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also raised allegations: "Haven't voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details about my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nigerian football association simply voted in its name.
The report came from the association on Friday: That was true, but of course it was not intended. The documents of election were "irreally" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nigerian election, it was said in a notice from the association. However, the second captain, Manuel Rosas, had chosen. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error", said the announcement. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "all as it stands in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases now allow Fifa to examine in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains only undisputed winner of the World Football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine-Affaire: Ranghohe Republicans advocating for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against the U.S. president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the decomposition of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden observed "for years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, and few have been aware of this. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump’s policy several times, for example against the easing of environmental protection regulations and the strengthening of immigration rules.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of U.S. federal states, have not formally agreed to participate in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolic. Nevertheless, first senators of the Republicans have also expressed critically about the situation. In the middle of Romney, for example, who represents Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also report that internal first cracks occur among the Republicans.
The affair could result in the initiation of a anti-Trump investigation, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the investigation procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could work out a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal of office was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, who are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unauthorisedly controlled the port of Lampedusa with the lifeboat "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new heavy accusations against rockets are coming out loud. Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been captured in a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants had recognized their torments in Italy. "We cannot rule out this, but have no secure information to do so ourselves," said Sea Watch speaker Ruben of the German press agency.
It was said by the police in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tormented, and even murdered in the North African country. It was Muhammad C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence", said the announcement back then.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They are coming without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people are fleeing from Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this be followed".
Italy's Justice Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini demanded an excuse from Rackete, who is still being found in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives to record delivery at Tesla
Tesla-chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record figures on the stock market.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 extras," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, it was also stated in Musk’s newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strongly the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures will have to be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Renews only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again be without spending plans before the new fiscal year begins on 1 October. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (continuing resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision on Monday at midnight, it would have come to a shutdown, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown turned off
For the time being, the Federal Government will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in due time on the 12 expenditure laws which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives where they have the majority. However, the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve expenditure plans which are hardly majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans apparently try to force $12 billion for the building of walls, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats interfere with the building plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the wall was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits separate at the building of the wall
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November is beyond. Also, a shutdown is not excluded at that time.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in good time, and the associated risk of a shutdown gains ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue funding the federal administration at the previous year's level, prohibit the travel activity of parliamentarians and hold back their wages until the new annual expenditure plans exist.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to benefit from in vitro fertilization, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous seed donation.
The presentation still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs for artificial fertilization for all women are to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm by dead husband
By a close majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, there were cases in which women complained in vain about the issue of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the provocation in Paris argued that such a child was thus born to bear a "very serious fate".
Many representatives of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition representatives, on the other hand, had expressed their support for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would impose a "double sorrow" if her husband's death left her child's desire unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment think it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot witness children. They have to be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the bond motherhood remains forbidden.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Reimbursement for climate: Calls for flight charges for universities are becoming louder
A great deal of flow is being done at universities, which is why in the future the country wants a climate tax to be carried out there too. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on climate taxes on flights from universities and universities, which was missed before the summer break, is again in motion. After the national rectors’ conference skeptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university for compensation of service flights are calling for the first step "necessary", at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, as stated in their opinion. The initial cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is now still on ice because the CDU has still not approved the submission of the Greens.
Russia is once again arresting North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the prisoners were to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days before, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a fire change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later fell victim to his serious injuries. However, this time there was no injured person, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage. North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard is driving patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
In the re-checks, 30,000 squid had been discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the information was seized after three fishing boats and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authorities had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of North Korea fishermen have been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage from North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-massed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, small living beings would also be taken out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Only 18,000 in the future: USA reduces the upper limit on asylum
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is squandering against those seeking protection: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal migration of refugees is further reduced. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqi asylum will be received.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the US Foreign Ministry stated. In the already almost expired marketing year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, there had been much higher entrance limits.
The raised ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. The Foreign Ministry nevertheless called the US "most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the language use of the President-in-Office of the United States.
A "responsible handling" of refugees is aimed at ensuring that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild them, says Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening process of lifting office.
The US government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups after representation from the foreign office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been threatened by the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken up.
The United States wants to achieve that people from this "northly triangle" in Central America apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to limit immigration at the US-South border with Mexico.
Judgment orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang-Utan female has been transferred to a reception station for apes in the U.S. at the request of Argentine justice from the former Buenos Aires Zoo. Born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986, the "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person" and therefore its release is compelling. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkeys are unable to adapt to wild life, they will live in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "bubbles", former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was undertaken by animal protectionists in 2014, has contributed to the conversion of Buenos Aires' zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education site for the conservation of biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extremberg climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new husar ride on the big tin in the Italian Alps, which is almost 3000 metres high.
Without nets, double floors or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550 meter high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he undercut the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder of the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, US sports goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (nearly 1.3 billion euros), which is 25 percent more than the previous year, as reported by the Group on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directs itself to its customers online.
Sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period by the end of August. The most powerfully, the Nike sales figures increased by 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon benefited from its approach to address consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People’s Republic.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus increase its competitive advantage. Investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Prohibition for Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on stadiums against a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToracism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing with AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters should never go back to a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scandalize racist abuses against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. One has to identify the responsible ones and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the speech was racist singing at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
But there were also discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now established 38 far-reaching fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are expected to stop entering the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. Therefore, the bans of four to seven years apply to the rest.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area. The twelve are accused of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and would have extorted Juventus employees to get more cheap cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - entire vintages are thought of with gripping names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21st, the crab caught officially at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also opened the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
As early as the 1990s, the people in Gaochun started growing crabs. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a high-income industry and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. Over the past years, Gaochun has actively sought to develop a large, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding as well as a technology-based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the incomes of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform on the distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services, and with care has set up the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network of services, a platform for lending" with a view to fully optimizing the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits the advantages given on the ground by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a signpost for setting up intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, the cultural and health sectors, as well as businesses for ecological agriculture, which are in the "3+2" area, here. At the same time, Gaochun has strongly developed the construction of a national, all areas of tourism and tourist destinations of national importance. This has involved the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, the state of buildings for civil services and for the public service, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer from the USA to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani stated on its official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no".
Ruhani describes the event this way: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I lift the sanctions," Ruhani added. The nature of the sanctions that should be ended has been the subject of a debate. "And they have clearly said we lift all sanctions."
However, this accusation had not been made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized. Given the current sanctions and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This was intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel on the margins of the UN General Assembly, France’s President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After the Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a disaster grew. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake last day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish vice-president Fuat Oktay on Friday. This is why the anxiety of a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, so hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the 5.8% earthquake had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises. Now, the government wants to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes, Oktay announced.
In the last 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Each year, badly built houses are falling - among other things, to the muzzled by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Town planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapi have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the centre as refuge sites have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Bee in August had the Istanbul Building Chamber warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not ground-quake safe.
The epicenter of the earthquake from Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at about seven kilometres deep, as the Afad Civil Protection Agency reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told Twitter that injury or damage had not been reported at first. The TRT government station showed people running panicously from the homes. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students wept as seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquake. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earths. Turkey is constantly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake near Istanbul in 1999. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday already hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with all the necessary needs next to door doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is rolling. When the next great quake comes, be unclear.
After his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was following developments from Istanbul’s disaster coordination centre (Akom). According to him, two Mosque Minarettes collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings waved. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more intense than Tuesday, writes a user. The boss of the Turkish Red Moon, Kerem Klinik, warned about aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to CNN Turkey, the date of the earthquake is officially stated at 13.59 (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first earthquake, there was an aftershock, which was reported with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter had also been located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad already announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan too was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. He said to CNN Türk that it would have been more likely. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy said. "early or later, the great earthquake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great concern also in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injuries. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine-Affaire
Two brilliant documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible withdrawal of office, the US Democrats see itself strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous notifier about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president mountains important points for investigations against the President. Trump himself once more sees himself as the victim of a "hexen hunt". Furthermore, he doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: Air passenger locked in toilet by United Airlines - Flyer diverted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was rerouted by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline reported according to US media.
In the event of an out-of-plan stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be freed from the narrow cabin. About an hour had been locked in, US media wrote calling on other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, according to U.S. media of flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline has apologised for all passengers. Open at first was whether the woman receives compensation.
The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now is the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people and is determined to be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions just beg the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write". By McEwan only appeared in the spring of the novel "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas, published for the first time in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into an immense vermin" and is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands the head", said the Diogeness publishing house.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise caused by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips to 31 October cancelled
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all travels by 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency order. Travels could not be made "for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
Also affected are Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid in full. The company left open as it is about starting travel from 1 November 2019. In agreement with insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the middle of the pleite of the British parent group and had filed insolvency proceedings on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels back money from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, as one Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not asked from now on for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise required," continued Spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
As a result, the insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodations on-site. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticized this.
How many hotels are affected would be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance speaker. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschal holidaymakers from Germany were still on their way. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return trip of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the current disbursements to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the go. It looks bad for Thomas-Cook customers who still want to fly on vacation. On the late Thursday evening the company announced that all trips would be cancelled until including 31 October. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
The company left the company open as from 1 November 2019. In agreement with insolvency insurance the further procedure was examined, it was said. In principle, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers may inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of refunding the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys detonation mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing Lady Diana's commitment for a long time. In Africa, he is now moving directly to the tracks of his mother.
The British Prince Harry in Angola has lit and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue splitter vest.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, on Friday morning he produced the ignition circle in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decade-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his journey to Africa, Harry wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same master of explosion, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she went at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a clear minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African journey since Monday, which began in Cape Town's South African tourist metropolis.
The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: he is not going to guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made by the polarizing British already of an eternal duration. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain is floating like a damocles sword over the blondhead. His suspension of the Parliament in order to be able to reverse its Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled at the beginning of this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks by 31 October in case of failure with the EU. However, Johnson had categorically excluded this from the agenda.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure seems not to pass on Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made indications that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-unification by the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by October 31st.
And best of all with a deal. I’m cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Still about six weeks later, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union without any agreement. However, the recent talks have not reached a breakthrough again. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the date of exit is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce the Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths caused by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. Furthermore, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, reported the US Health Authority CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been known in Europe. Complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The Spanish-based construction contractor and actor calls for a "people revolution". For this Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which criticises corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with a million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities have been alerted. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence has already been observed. Several subway stations have remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square have been blocked. Already in recent days, the police had increased their road controls and pedestrian phones have been searching partially for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura had not been held in Egypt for many years. According to the Human Rights Organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW reported under appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo blockes websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013, after he has overthrown the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox from Greenland Expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival at the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed by, among other things, the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race hunt "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has examined and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He had waited for many years for the young generation to come to mind. One knows for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under public exclusion," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. The expedition was measured with a drone of Greenlandic glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics, it was said.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in the last decades."
Cheap Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist women paid for noodles 430 Euro
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed to be two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to Rome's reputation. We ask the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud," demanded a speaker from Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt came up with the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be seen from the invoice. A drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice was also normal, the host farmer said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump, after the turbulent revelations of the past days, could actually be confronted with a withdrawal process, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation at the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is about weeks until a decision is taken.
At the beginning of the scandal is probably the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who finally brought the discussion of concern for national security and for US democracy with his complaint to the public, is monstros: The President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He has used Ukraine’s dependence blackmail and thus forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published contribution of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not render the full text. However, the telephone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in whose center besides Trump stands above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view in May 2019, the story begins when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't interfere in a choice, we interfere in an investigation of what we have the right to do," he says. One might think it was inappropriate, but "it's nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be prosecuted in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information could be very, very helpful to my clients and as helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, at the time, said critics to construct a reason for the Russian investigations in the USA. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely what Trump will be talking about on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the President is: The former Vice-President and currently promising candidate for the presidential presidential presidential candidate Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, forced the release of the then Ukrainian Advocate General Wiktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation he was responsible for the gas company in which his son Hunter Biden was active, Biden senior had financially extorted Ukraine in order to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian general prosecutor go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Furthermore, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the US government was not the only Western partner who insisted on his release. Furthermore, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disturbances at Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, especially Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website allemistungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 15.30 p.m.. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disorder, although not yet to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disorders
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also resort to Twitter this time especially to make their anger air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed for the recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 p.m. we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the tube boat."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT charging wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have just been launched, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - first and foremost the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to start a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful to the devices, according to the findings of the University of Warwick. This is why the significantly larger heat development is. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have always measured above 30 degrees even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces capacity, but also does not last for so long. Thus, the life span is lower. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone always charge by cable. Since a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of a battery exchange even once again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a tedious cable salad and laborious plug binge. Since Qi (results for inductive energy transmission) a global standard, in which Apple is exceptionally involved, is hardly limited. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to their own data, a Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator reported.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of climbers standing on Mount Everest snake.
The image of the masseandrang triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-metre-high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May, eleven climbers died during the climb.
A problem for Purja could become the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, it is called bad weather. In the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow it to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman reported on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four cabavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers, whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed each year by elephants, usually when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
According to Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants live. Their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
Prisoned British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Sena Impero" leaves Bandar Abbas, which was announced by the shipping agency Bandar Abbas, more than two months after his arrest by Iran, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian revolutionary guards had set the tanker operating under British flag on 19 July under the accusation of disregarding the rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critique
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to examine in full the pleite of travel giant Thomas Cook. This is about the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as the question of why the British government was not allowed to help the company fighting for survival financially. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control of external auditors," said the chairman of the committee Rachel Reeves in London. "Openly we have to do it with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the family-increased risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are likely to be more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for the calculations of the individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it went on in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring cars to customers quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Teslas shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to reach its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit figures will have to be produced in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will British government take care of Brexit law? Johnson holding back
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is seeking to circumvent the last law adopted by Parliament against an irregular Brexit. On Friday, he said only to journalists that his government would adhere to applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had stated on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shock" in order to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postponed the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said that he is establishing a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement".
Iran apparently rides high uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contracting partners in the fight against the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they are not in line with their promises, he put "further steps" in view of the agreements of the tirelessly negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict surrounding the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States left the agreement alone to force Iran to change its course in an aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump’s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with more stringent conditions and now again sets out to impose severe sanctions on Tehran. Iran has finally responded to this with a resurgence of the limited uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of pressure of US sanctions, presumed Rohani. However, there will still be further discussions that hopefully give way to a solution.
Rohani continues to challenge Iran's development of attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the mixed situation changed: Germany, France and the UK followed on Monday the U.S. estimate that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen supported by Iran had become aware of the attack, which, however, was regarded as a false confession by the USA. "We have nothing to do with it," continued Rohani on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General debate would not have been able to do so. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the widespread sanctions of the US administration would have to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to change to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from other star traverses solar system
Astronomers are observing a comet from the depths of space. This was done before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially just a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on 30 August by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017 which was sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into a foreign solar system from nearby before it disappears on a never-ending sight. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Astrological Institute of the Canarys. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance clearly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US space travel agency Nasa in a message.
According to the analyses, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyperbole orbit leading it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its explorer, the interstellar sister, who was initially led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been approached. So many months remain for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," said Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken visitors into vision. Thus a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canarys (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said Julia de León, IAC researcher. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of equal to two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet interception hunters) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth by 2028. According to Esa-scientific director Günther Hasinger, it should either wait on an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Timely before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed on the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are scheduled to be handled annually at the new airport, and 72 million are expected to be in 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “Sester” because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways and runways, which are to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new metro transports passengers to the city centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had made it known several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the - and much smaller - capital airport in Germany since 2006 has so far been postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New oversonic aircraft is scheduled to fly 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming about this. It is intended to make this flight a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breaking Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the Oxfordshire Reaction Engines company for the 2030s, the U.S. channel CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said CEO Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only oversonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde covered the New York Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003 and required three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers were killed. Last year, US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop together with the US spacecraft agency Nasa an oversonic plane, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable rams".
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipping in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US President Donald Trump wants to track down possible untight places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," Trump said on Thursday to U.S. envoys at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and in the past one was "a little different" than today.
This was considered to be an intimidation attempt against typifiers. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media spread audio recordings from the address on Friday. Democratics responded indignantly to the President’s statement.
The democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced preparations for an anti-Trump investigation on Tuesday. Their allegations were based, in particular, on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence worker, who raised serious accusations against Trump and his central government. On major public pressure, the signs of the notifier had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, according to which the U.S. president "uses the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country is interfering in the U.S. election 2020 in its favor.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate those who could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about former business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his agent from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House, with a view to Ukraine's telephone, of cover-up: Leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been created. However, this was removed from a standard database and was stored instead in a particularly protected system after the discussion of lawyers from the White House, but only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" had spread information from second hand, which would have proved to be ineffective. Therefore, there might be no tipmer or spies at all.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have given information to the Whistleblower, however, it was outrageous. The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded alarmedly and complained, Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives several investigations have been taking place in various committees against Trump and its surroundings for months. In the face of Ukraine’s accusations, the Democrats are now making further investigations with a new sense in order to initiate a possible withdrawal of office against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a schedule for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, Chief of the Intelligence Committee. Trump attacked the ship sharply, accused him of misrepresentation of things, and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted ship and had asked for withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government workers from the security and foreign policy field, who were mostly among democratic but also under Republican presidents, put themselves in a statement published on Friday, behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible removal of office. If the accusations were true, the "a skrupless abuse of power" by Trump would be said in it.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called "impeachment" procedure. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal of office was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. No US President has yet been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Board of Directors: Jobs are reduced "slenderly"
The plans of the VW brand to reduce production costs could go at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the automaker’s works council around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros. Of these, 500 million euros will be saved this year.
One key to this is staff costs. By 2020, the future pact negotiated between companies and works council already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone. In principle, a job can only be reduced by car builders if it is proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learnt from works councils, jobs in production, which are not actually for the disposition, are "smoothed" over another way - that is, past the official course. Thus, becoming regular posts would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Works Council has no way of forcing the occupation. In the meantime, staff in many places are missing, labour compression is increasing, the concerns about the gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants would be greater. This also increases the fear that the production of vehicles could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said only: "A change in the volume of employment takes place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more and centralize new projects around the world. It also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim behind this is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. At a management conference in Berlin, production board Andreas Tostmann said: "Even in uncertain times from Brexit to the threat of trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-resistant."
On this path there are already successes: for example, this year since 2013 production costs per vehicle would be reduced for the first time compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exactly figures on the production duration do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper it is at the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the VW-internal rule applies that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year, so that the plant is profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling diesel demand and the problems in the transition to the new consumption and exhaust gas test process WLTP.
However, as Tostmann's head of production has already announced last year, Wolfsburg is said to have a million cars rolled from the band. This is intended to make it possible to bundle the production of the golf in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is giving off the golf production through the conversion to the location for e-auto production.
In addition, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, he is expected to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburger for the first time.
Forced to prostitution with Voodoo: People's dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria are burdened with ulcers, sluggished into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
On Friday in Bochum, six alleged traffickers from Nigeria have been sentenced to probation and imprisonment sentences of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had taken young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. To force their obedience, the adult Nigerians had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest in their home country.
The victims were between the ages of 17 and 22 years. They were brought to the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan sluice boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to different brothels in order to cover the alleged sluice costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on brothels in the trial. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Richter Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were correctly opposed".
The judgments are based on commercial and bond-based inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, holding company and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
The flight attendants union Ufo once again threatened with strikes in the long run with the Lufthansa Group.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on October 14th of the labour battle measures in the LH Group," said Ufo tariff board Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO for months. This also concerns whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
In this regard, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to state that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeals against it. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely differently," said Ufo CEO Flohr.
In August Lufthansa also filed an application with the Landes Arbesitsgericht Frankfurt in order to have Ufo’s status as a trade union judicial review. The company argues that the trade union has not used a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
In the course of which numerous members of the Executive Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baubleis, had gone ahead of the discussion. The Ufo had already suspended a original vote on strike by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July because of the doubts about its leadership.
easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far Saudi Arabia has not just been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is supposed to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visas.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the tourism commission announced that the number of international and domestic visitors would be increased to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a one-historical moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas usually only become available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had met two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the following, national oil production broke down dramatically, oil prices increased. It is expected to take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber put in preparation for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding feast. On Thursday (local time) the model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the people magazine, had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the Celebrity-pair wants to marry church on the next weekend.
The beavers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York office. There had been no larger celebration at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash type is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-territorial species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities are causes of the threat, the World Nature Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "hazardous", "strongly endangered", "at risk of extinction" and "degraded in nature" to "degraded". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberic and Wild Roskastanie Threatened
In Germany, mainly Eberian (Sorbus), said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "hazardous" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan Mining Moth next to a mushroom. It has spread from southeastern Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Species of shrubs and moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than one fifth of the molluscs and mooses and almost half of all shrub species were threatened, according to IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wildlife, inhaled species, agricultural practices and climate change. Mushrooms like snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and were an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe Office. "We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake in front of Istanbul: 34 Injuries reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. According to the information, there were no deaths. dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the earthquake last day, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises.
Now, the government wants to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes over the past 20 years, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquake. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian soil.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strengths of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
On Tuesday, a strong 4.6 tremor had shaken the Istanbul region and the authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin-pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will present the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "The bigger it won't be," Shakira wrote on a photo of herself and Lopez. She is madly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be ready in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamt of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the mid-term show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She could hardly expect to "show what we girls can do on the world's largest stage."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to be standing on one of the world's largest stages alongside another artist, representing Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kings" were on one stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sinking audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have recently sunk viewers: This February, the spectacle in the United States attracted the least of the audiences for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
At the mid-term show of the past Super Bowl, there had been some riots in the run-up: in the debate about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, Topstars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was in front of NFL games in the national anthem of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been undisputed since March 2017 and has no longer disputed an NFL party. He accuses the clubs not to hire him for political reasons.
Cook pleads: Hotels get money from the insurance
According to a press report, some banks are expected to be expensive in the pleite of the travel provider Thomas Cook. There are high amortizations on outstanding bonds and loans. The credit suisse is also affected by this, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make total amortizations of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report. This would have been shown by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase amortizations of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual amounts to be written would rather be at the top of the bandwidths, said an expert to the paper.
The extent to which the creditor’s losses will actually be great will show up after the insolvency proceedings have ended. One person close to this procedure did not boast too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s around 40 aircraft in the UK were “old” and many of the real estates were in bad situations. Most money could be obtained by selling the airport slots and Thomas Cook brand, it was said.
Rickete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who should have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule out this, but have no secure information for ourselves," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of raped, tortured and killed in Libya. The suspected perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not verify who left them on their ships. "They are coming without passports".
Carola Rickete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th, and a ship of the Italian financial police was framed. On that day, the three suspects should have arrived there. Investigations against the captain are under way for aid to illegal immigration.
United States warn Federal Government against Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government against trusting Huawei in the Chinese network equipment.
We believe that the risks are too big," said Pai the "handelsblatt" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which requires every company "under Chinese case law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continues the FCC chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand from suppliers a "certificate of trust".
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "trade sheet" on its own information.
Pai doubtes that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It was "very difficult to imagine," that a government authority, "whereever, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks", continues the FCC chief.
The Chinese group Huawei has made close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company, which is said to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai the "handelsblatt".
The U.S. suggests that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the USA.
Chemical factory in Northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A huge fire wall lights the sky over a French chemical factory. The fire is deleted after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in Rouen, Northern France, on Thursday the schools and children's cribs will remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be carefully opened on Friday, the responsible prefecture was reported. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to be exposed to smoke. There was no injury. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, protect their food and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There was still the risk that after the extinguishing of odor spread, the prefecture was on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police and gendarmen were in use at the fire site.
A huge black smoke column had risen from the chemical factory before. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the factory of the company Lubrizol, which repairs additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city center.
The Normandie factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites that are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso in Milan.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" was initially detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out at around 02.40 in the early morning, the authorities reported. The cause was not clear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest, and now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening in the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone was weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to worsen in order to make the necessary decisions."
Acting would have to be those states that had budgetary room for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France did not have these spaces, added the Minister and referred to the high debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt had to be "stabilised" and "decreased", said Le Maire.
Over the past few years, France has repeatedly brought appeals to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellowwest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, expected to be 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises Parliament's "capitulation law".
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, however, the Tory politician turns out.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an irregular Brexit - despite the law that was last passed by Parliament, which is exactly what to prevent. On a corresponding question Johnson simply told journalists that his government would adhere to applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date, should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had stated on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shock" in order to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that postponed the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was establishing a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is that with an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, said, in the meantime, he felt the political struggles for Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the EU's exit was still being achieved: "We will enjoy this, we will win, we will leave (note: from the EU), not worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign in front of the EU's 2016 election campaign, is now acting as a chief strategist in the UK's downing street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister into a very hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all standing in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Bags) dives deeply into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was very proud and touched when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontwife Chrissie Hynde also included.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration to the legacy of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, a few hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course one is always at the heart of one: her husband Paul - as one may never have seen him before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McC were an extraordinary family, but that also lived a normal life beyond the spotlight on her farm in southern England or Scotland. According to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she would have slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made of old potato boxes. And it wasn’t always clean with McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the polaroid camera catches the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they’re much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to cut it in the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to always catch the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
That's where the light, the composition, the cut-out and the colours make "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in all anecdotals, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from neighbouring countries. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had "returned because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran in particular on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is pursuing a nuclear programme and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but it is important to protect and serve US citizens, and the US immigration system is currently overburdened.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been threatened by the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - and from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted.
The 1980 programme selected refugees from all over the world and relocated to the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current limit of 30,000 is one temperature. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Relief organizations are horrified at the announced downfall in the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would thus continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - both legal and illegal - and the US government expects 350.000 asylum applications for the next budget year according to its own data. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Comes close to a tickle"
U.S. President Donald Trump sued for guidance in the Whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever had given him such clues to the informant who accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a peak," says Trump, according to a private event recorded on Thursday in New York. That is a corresponding report of several US media.
As a result, Trump spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial processes in the White House, he replied: "This is a bit near a peak." Trump added: "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers valued the latter comment on a possible allusion to the death penalty. The democrats were making sharp criticism of Trump’s statements and intimidating him of witnesses. Furthermore, it was an attempt to hinder a congress investigation into a possible withdrawal procedure against him, wrote the presidents of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervision at the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower asks the President in a complaint which has now been published to misuse his office in order to request interference from another country into the US election 2020. In particular, he is concerned with his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump urged him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misbehavior.
It is still unclear who is both the Whistleblower itself and its informants. As the New York Times reports, however, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Again and again, people try to get across the Aegean sea from Turkey to Greece. They regularly know the often much too small boats. Now, seven migrants have been killed in the fall of a hose boat - including five children.
Seven migrants were killed in the wake of the Greek island of Chios. Among the victims of death were also a baby and four more children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also said to be a sluice, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alitia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations refugee relief work (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Stops Concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has found a bad end because of an inadmissibility of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice refused the service. In the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it still runs."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey could really not speak now. Townsend promised the audience to come to his expense at a restitution concert, but an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, The Who announced their appearances at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rent suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
WeWork has risen to become the largest office rental company in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from the small startup to the driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. Owners must fear billions of revenues.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world’s largest real estate markets. The company had been deposed a few days ago by the founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned stock exchange and began to sell subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British Financial Times, WeWork, among other things, reported the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. This is, among other things, the largest rental of office space suddenly from the market in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it into some small units in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, we have been burning money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs by renting are expected to increase ever new large areas to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. To limit the loss, the new management is now expected to pull the emergency brake and stop renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into lease contracts with periods of up to 15 years from which commitments amount to more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, almost 300,000 square metres of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork’s new contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas that were on the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office void in the US metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpes wrote in the business insider. Similarly, it looks in London where WeWork now operates several dozens of office locations in the best location.
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house purchased last year by the Sparkassen Fund provider Deka for nearly 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the billions expected. Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork do not have them in spite of the long-term lease contracts. Because the rental of the individual WeWork locations usually takes place by each extra-founded subsidiary, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only held in close limits.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 wilder fishers who had fished illegally in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian Domestic Intelligence Service FSB of the Interfax agency on Friday.
It was only ten days ago that 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Before the border guards had been shot and three of them had been injured. This time there were no injured, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastguards, according to their own information, were patrols for the protection of their marine biological resources. Another 30,000 squids had been discovered during the re-checks. In addition, the information was seized after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the 2018 Coast Guard Station recorded a total of more than 8,000 violations
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained of high ecological damage from North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-massed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these small living beings would also be taken out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also the ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
In the last week's arrests, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured. According to FSB, a North Korean who had also been wounded died later on from his injuries. On that 17th September, Russian border guards first set a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
United States ban on entry into the United States against ex-President Castro
The U.S. has imposed bans on the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs established this in a communication with Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations" on Thursday. As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he presupposes a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arrested arbitrarily and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also blamed by the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, for human rights violations there. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the continuing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had banned entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle has been raging between the government and the opposition for months. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro’s government to force him to kneel and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro’s closest allies. Venezuela’s socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the U.S. and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress its opponents.
New Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the road again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning again actions and rallys in dozens of countries worldwide. The beginning is expected to be due to the shift of time in New Zealand and Australia before the protests over Europe go to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrants also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the global appeal on this Friday after the record participation of the last week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people spread for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - were involved in protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. According to a list of events in at least 65 cities, among them cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15 years, Thunberg had been in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This was the result of the Fridays-for-future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but also scientists and other adults increasingly.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming has to be limited to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Tower with a high-sea racing yacht. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke with the heads of state and government of the earth in keen knowledge. In her home country of Stockholm, she had been given a commitment to her commitment to more climate protection of the Right Livelihood Foundation's Alternative Nobel Prize on Wednesday.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia are not allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker from the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, the agency Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
However, if you smoke, you have to expect a fine of 3.000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light up a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the same burning candles will fall under ban. You can also grill meat spits on the balcony.
Hit Cybercriminals - Investigator Lift Servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites via the internationally acting criminals in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel.
This was reported by the Advocate General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a big action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The customers of the suspects should have been, among other things, the operators of the world’s second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, “Wall Street Market” - the investigators had smashed in spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom router was also controlled by a cyberbunker server at the end of November 2016, according to the Advocate General’s Office.
Such a hoster had been removed for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It has been the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans again actions and rallys in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, as well as in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests Who are actually Thunberg's backmen?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm up the climate. So, all the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power of this time in the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing a climate activist? Historical master achievement or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person is able to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he also won a host of young people for himself and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made his way to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reachingly thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also, old-fashioned followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disillusioned by the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also made too thick by some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action was very good in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Is it even authentic for certain groups of persons to work together with stock exchange agents during the World Restoration Action? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question even pious projects of certain trendsets.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is currently traversing our solar system.
The conjecture of the astronomers has been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently traversing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his explorer 2I/Borisov and is currently busy worldwide astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was sighted during transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights into a foreign solar system from nearby. Apparently, the Comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canarys. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbole orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe it in detail. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be investigated from the Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. "Then, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. That two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently did a giant asteroid pass the Earth and get dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely objectionable": Rachel Johnson is horrified by brother
For Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister in clear words teases the wary language of the Prime Minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly getting up - at least verbally. At the question-time in the Unterhaus on this Wednesday, this came up with massive outrages of the opposition, and now more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the station Sky News that her brother uses words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, long-drawn, quadrupled, bullied and feathered" and she considers this to be extremely objectionable. She did not recognise the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken part in the elections to the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit "Change UK" party.
She was particularly affected by the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly sub-house member who had been murdered by a Neonazi just a few days before the 2016 retirement referendum. The best way to honor his memory by going through the Brexit was to say Boris Johnson in the Unterhaus. "It is very tasteless to refer to a Member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," said Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come out of the right-wing camp, who feels "with this kind of language". For all who mourned around her, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he twittered. The best way to honor it is if you are passionately and determined to act for what you believe in - no matter what view you may be. But never should you "demomonize the other side." He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen, in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson had laid down younger brother Jo's office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory-Deputy. "I've been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in the past months - it's an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As reported by the "Times", all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that "is not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they said: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside of Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
The NFL has a strong mark in its 100th anniversary: In the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots are performing. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming finals of the US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday in the coming year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is puerto-American origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sent an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is to be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November on.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a Telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests in the USA is expected with excitement every time. This year many people see the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones made for Furore. As a rule, at the NFL finale, there are well over 100 million television viewers, it is also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy in advance. The reason was the fight for the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused protests against police force against blacks, to rise up in the play of the national anthem and, among other things, had been taken hard by US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the Maroon 5 rock group appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber uses Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the first time.
The two men who have an influence on whether there is blood on the streets of Egypt have both spent the last week abroad. One of them was floating back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who replaced the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis’s approach to political Islam and had not lost a syllable over the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the President. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television."
In the opinion of the President of the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets, Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-giving voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and tearooms of the country: with his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to stand up against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are starving, the president in luxury swung and let himself be built magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi is based his rule, presents corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite well what he is talking about - at least this is the impression of many Egyptians, as the right-to-exploding click numbers show.
After the first week since Sisis' grip after power had been demonstrated by thousands against his rule, and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. That so many people would really venture on the streets was unlikely. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants rejected Al-Sisi and demanded his departure. At these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber shots. At first, these videos were not independently verified. In security circles it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators broke down banners with the President's portrait last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outposts. In Cairo, several underground stations were closed because of "maintenance work", most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011 were blocked. And on the Raba Square, where in 2013 followers of the overthrowed Muslim brother Mursi, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent dissatisfaction: Sisis Future Party wanted to hold here a large rally for the President.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tahrir square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collide with police officers." But as a retreater, that's not to understand: "All Egypt is Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
The Internet connection always seems to be much slower than applied by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to trust the speed information of the provider blindly. Customers can verify for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the pre-promising transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
The connection always seems to be much slower than applied by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set an appropriate time limit of 14 days for the provider to produce the promised performance. This is best done in writing by sending a letter of invitation.
If this does not happen after multiple calls, customers can cancel and, in some cases, also claim damages. However, in the event of outstanding success, only the cause of the action will help.
First-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has expressed his support for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here, is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the decomposition of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have been aware of this dissatisfaction. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policy several times, such as the easing of environmental protection regulations and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: More Marvel-Film planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was absolutely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is reported by several U.S. media that the film is already scheduled to start. In the USA, the film will start as of July 16, 2021.
Marvel-Boos Kevin Fige is quoted in the magazine "Screenrant": "I am pleased that Spidery's path is continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidery version. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does the sudden good news come about? It is alleged that Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of incoming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the big finale. In the final episode, there were many happy ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, were brought to the tribute in a charming manner. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
One thing ahead: Herzog Meghan did not return for a final farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects showed once again the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his serving sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a very promising remark regarding his suit. Whether he has actually overturned a walk, the abused Harvey of the groom wants to know only to say snippy: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four more children were drowned by the Kenter of a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the accident, as reported by the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations refugee relief work (UNHCR), 174 people were killed. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible Commissioner for the EU, he wants to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help cope.
On Friday, a speaker from the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister of Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusual numbers of migrants arriving from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, said the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
Finally, the increased figures raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who are illegally entering the Greek islands to Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every displaced Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only laborious on the Greek side due to the lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, almost 29,400 people are affected by Lesbos. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 had it been so many, the state broadcasting radio reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" to be one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature jumps to create within a short time and led to more heart attack. People with cardiovascular disease, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo-pane
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was for this reason manipulated by the cups?
The Canadian Green Chef holds a multi-way cup in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It was not noticed for quite a long time - and finally it was noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee cup with a metal straw. On the party’s website she was shown on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and was also distributed to the media - and there was a cup (Papp) cup as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chefin must be responsible for photo pans
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produces fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection". In the middle of an election campaign for the Unterhaus election, Trudeau is also increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and attacked the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cups".
May was shocked and encouraged on her blog not to have known anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she put it right, be out of bamboo. She always had it with her. A speaker of the party said it was only to put the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. The photo can only be seen on the website.
May writes, her suffering for the employee who did so. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked her about her team, "If they want to work a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come to Shitstorms for their use of single-way plastic or for flight trips. However, her pictures were not photoshopped. So the boss of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice with plastic spoons on holiday, as reported merkur.de*.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Life-long flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was assured by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontanously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many of these are dreaming of passengers. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how one should not do it: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Follow on Instagram Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, Jaqueline had refused to upgrade even though she had shown a mail that was supposed to provide her Cathay Pacific with an upgrade. The letter is intended to have received the influence from an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline once again tried to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical: they went off at the headquarters. In fact, the employee from whom the mail was supposed to have dissociated the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaquelines' ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. She had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan for 1,400 US dollars (about 1.280 euros).
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocate, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also charged the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, Airline’s terms and conditions indicate that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices are reported to report on ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the course slide was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had killed five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels in Yemen, allied with Iran, had accused the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would depress the political tension in the region.
Should an agreement actually be reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the resource strategy department at the Saxo Bank of the news agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the last days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
At last, under the appeal of Insider, Bloomberg had reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was moving faster after the attack in mid-September than thought. Thus, the production volume had reached a volume of eight million barrels a day and was moving back towards the original quantity.
Last but not least, there were several press releases calling on insiders to report on rapid progress made by the state oil group Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently wants to plan an exchange and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still in front of anchor, Reederreichf Erik Hånell informed Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the United States announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to Iran’s arch enemy in Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Great Britain had temporarily increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Trump’s accusations are intensifying
In the affair of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, conspicuous accusations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government staff would have tried intensively to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous clueer. The spokesman of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "concealing". Trump spoke of a "hexen hunt".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit of powerman Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. The sense and prospects of such a meeting were questionable because of the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the USA and South Korea. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "strong" decision by Trump to get back to being approached.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he made a statement. The negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been under way since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revitalize the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers are supposed to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically ignited and destroyed a blue splitter vest. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he created the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later asked in front of running TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but which have not helped to get away to commit themselves to help."
Pound under pressure - interest reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations are increasing to the sterling pound of the Bank of England (BoE) in the near future. On Friday, the UK currency fell by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
Sales were triggered by statements by the music banker Michael Saunder. This led to an interest-rate reduction, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy at the foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was a defender of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit hack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, if necessary, wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the world athletics association.
New details about the doping scandal in Russia are emerging at the beginning of the World Championships – and they are destroying the few of the credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only in the beginning. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed, and the Wada had banned the Russian anti-doping agency (Russia) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes in the country under neutral flag, and at the winter games in February 2018 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, and in the summer the World Cup with the host took place in Russia even the World Cup.
Missing Positive Results
In September, the Wada lifted the Rusada Bann again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases at the state doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the world athletics association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data was manipulated from the Moscow analysis laboratory. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a Whistleblower, and those they received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings were missing in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the athletics association is the only organization to hold on to the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes are starting under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and are undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been put into space and invited Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
