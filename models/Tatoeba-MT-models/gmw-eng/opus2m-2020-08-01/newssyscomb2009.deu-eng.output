Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they reach 29 percent in total
A significant weakening of both parties of the so far great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought, after the first preliminary results, the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly serious losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the heel.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the head of the Kärntner state Jörg Haider, is prepared for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the results achieved so far, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of post-war Austria, and especially with the People's Party, which had called for the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chanzer Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both the right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received provisionally 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fears at the same time that the year 1999 could repeat when the People's Party had reached agreement with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is clearly committed to this development and is suspended from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the Green Party moved into Parliament, but it suffered minor losses, falling from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-prongedth, and consequently has not moved into Parliament either.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India for the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg considers that a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then certainly, then there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions that in judicial matters the executive could only take difficult action.
Despite all of this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the indictment and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wanted the case in which the case falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshi's opinion would be best if he were to go to appeal at a higher instance.
He could so request a security deposit and wait in freedom for his judgment, according to the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made a similar statement during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a gift would be in question for him," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to send the condemned "competent legal support" to the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," claimed Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of its partner, the Czech Republic reaffirmed the importance of the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had been given the promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter was given by the Minister.
"I was already quite promised," he simply observed.
A Czech judge over ringing around the sea floor
It shall arrive at an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are shown.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also belongs to the adjacent sea floor.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Marine Rights.
His boss, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows and complements the interpretation.
This is where labour and enthusiasm prevail.
So far, the sea floor has a little known world rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, the more ore and other non-reproductive raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A sea floor bigger than the mainland
Today, the neighbouring states vehemently announced their right to the new marine areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers away from the shores of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the shores, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be demonstrated by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide technical and legal assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful," adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently hit the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly expand its marine areas.
But also New Zealand is a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the territory of the ocean floor, which the Convention calls the "common heritage of humanity".
There's no state in here anymore.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the sea floor is not a gold tomb," says Director Mikulka, adding that its "one area is legally defined and the system is established under contract".
Czech Republic
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
It was granted the status of a so-called "road-breaking investor" in 1991, as was the case with investors from some less other countries.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the silent ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the sea floor.
"You can promote there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a design as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, the legendary twilight that the legend has brought to life after the Golem.
German special workers were on site in the event of hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
In the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt, more and more details become known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German specialists were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists in the Bundeswehr as well as GSG 9, the Flyer Staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Relief Agency were in the place of liberation.
However, as spokespersons of the ministries continued to report on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages had run and fled their prisoners when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"For that, fortunately, it didn't happen," said a speaker from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group had abducted from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged to and fro in the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until recently, the identity of the hostages remained unclear as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The Gerettes have now arrived in Cairo well-preserved.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the care of the German Embassy.
For details of release, he did not express himself.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to "Image" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first Chamber of the US Congress has made the 700 billion dollar rescue package very difficult for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones ran into the depths.
By 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority in favour of the program to limit chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to vote, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the prevention of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke down by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The reason was the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure to do so, fell back.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Deputies and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite poor economic prospects, according to a study, the Germans' desire to travel remains untiring.
During the winter season bookings, rice offices recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study of the market research institute GfK, there are also higher booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of travel agencies in October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results are GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates it high for the entire market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the USA was in demand, the DRV reported.
Here, the increase in the number of bookings is around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic destinations of the Germans, are particularly sought after.
Especially vacation trips are high in the course, DrV President Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs "are better calculable for the customer than for the individual organized holiday".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
Also the summer months had been very well booked, so a sales increase compared to the previous year would again be recorded - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My First Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from Liter-Krügen und Promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She's blond, television moderator and wears a customized dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is a second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: In a matter of three minutes on the meadow, the photographers already fall on us and cut the memory cards completely - very flattering and this on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap Dirndl seems to be fulfilling its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and, in fact, north of the white sausage-stäquator, the feeling of well-being remained in the costume until now.
But only once arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half that bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks respondent or embarrassingly touched - everything perfectly normal.
Strange views at the chocolate stand only reap my dirndl sprigs.
A Munichwoman draws my attention to the fact that I would have wronged the kiss: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed."
Secretly, I'll take the loop from the back to the left.
"Fit," said it and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which "To drunk to get threshed!" stands and stretches out the naked back to an unbittened person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attiudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "oooooo".
He tells me that after he got rid of his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of which think he's a trasher.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, medicaments walk across the festival square, which has to take care of the poor slugkers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at once drag a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Empty, full back.
Whoever is in the Promille sarch is below the plane, you can't see.
"These are the ones where gornimmer packs," one of the sanitizers called me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of slight driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deeply into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial desire.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platform with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is breaking down, for example.
But once you're inside the vaulted ticket switch, there's no doubt about the sublimeness of the project, whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, who was a funnel in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans were paralysed during the first world war.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable boundaries of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, passing far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling judicial and development party, the ACP, has introduced a very new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key facts of this new foreign policy, I have climbed the night train into the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish Member Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the equivalent of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered to be a new city, for the new secular state project to turn the Ottoman past back.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has triggered some distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the ACP headquarters, a specially made, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kinikiolioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could sometime," I asked, "to be forced to decide?"
"Turkish," he said, "didn't want to make this decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I was talking to almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be, in the transferred sense, can drive Europe as a whole on straight rails east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another night of sleepless sleep, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, lie in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to get me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir last sang in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never passed over years.
How often did death stop us from "let music speak for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, but never too lavish.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have written reviews for more than a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by any one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hates conductors who, according to his words, simply went home "with one or two well-known scoops in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In her reputation for William Woodruff (September 25th), you write that "in 1946 he took over the lessons of economic history again in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950-1951 during a Houblon Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments."
Second round of the excellent sale at Honda.
In November Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior space, this large-scale limousine offers a much larger size.
In addition, the technical fines are also used to save even more comfortable driving and petrol.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, it aims to stress the innovative design, the new spatial flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics.
Nevertheless, before you start analysing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon as far as its sale in other markets is concerned.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, approximately one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of total sales to Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows you to cover up the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which are 4000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain compared with the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 metres, and the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to Japanese producer market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
In view of the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimetres) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown to 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1,52 meters.
Along with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both versions have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and simultaneously provides torque-intensive power for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reached 78 hp - has 5.3 liter of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto bees' that avoid collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight dates back to bees' swarming behaviour and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co.'s technical development centre have developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layered Nissan safety shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facette eyes of the bee, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, which allows you to fly in their personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) in order to simulate the all-round perspective.
He notices obstacles that are in the distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board, which is directly translated into a signal for preventing the collision
'In the moment when obstacle is observed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other systems is that this elusive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can not deviate to the top or the bottom, but also not overeck; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
This device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, so it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan prophesies to introduce in serial cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead while driving to the target, avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's trembling before she's burdened with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly eligible banks, an entertaining and informative game has been developed for the internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment not to ask for credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, if a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes her capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common price at $25.25, which will result in a total of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is below 19% of the share's price value of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a 10% profit and can be sold again at a price of 3125 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
'This strategic link represents an important opportunity to speed up the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which should enable him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply declared that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'A week ago', said Toshide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo, 'we thought that the participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their price value.
And the business will go with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged to more than 50% over the sale value within a given period, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow him to make use of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a Group press officer refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, his balance sheet had been significantly reduced.
The last few weeks were hard for the group that had to look at how their exchange rate declined by half, while the price of insurance against inability to pay rose.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, to have lifted 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the socialism of the 21st century is new.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morale and the Equatorial Correa.
It was that third party that made this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, the plan of a new constitution.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of voters, 64% voted in the referendum with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% corresponded to 'No', 7% of the polls were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, more than half of all votes cast must be voted.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the constituencies’ exits and a counter-organization of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and prophesied 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The `constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito and congratulated the Equatorials.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held in silence in accordance with the U.S. Organization of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text made up of 444 points to ensure 'new socialism' for which the President is acting.
The Constitutional Project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the oil production of foreign companies and from foreign currencies, which sends out refugees to the country.
The project, which will be driven forward by the Correa chosen in 2006, will also grant more power to the head of state which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each and will have the opportunity to disband the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical and schooling, which the President has already begun to introduce in that country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base as a starting point for American antidrug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive in the desert for eleven days were brought back to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and unharmed manner this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they had been released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza right next to Cairo International Airport at 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly, without being able to talk to the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi Hospital, an alien district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'no ransom was paid', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the field.
After she was taken captive on 19 September at an off-road car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hideaway by 35 unknown kidnappers.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizers of Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, launched the attack at night shortly before dawn.
'On both sides, shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said he who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special units have played.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result, thanks to the professionalism and the performance of our men, from the intelligence and from the special units', he explained without further details.
He also objected that a ransom had been paid.
The evening before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol, where the kidnappers were, of which six, including the leader from Chad, killed and two were arrested.
The army declared that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which, however, immediately disputed this movement.
Letters - The Silent majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
That's all the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will rise and sue the deplorable sums that will be granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or the national historical places that starve?
What politicians will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and culturally important buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government makes 3.5 million euros available for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
Our American neighbours have written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all districts of government, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage that protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments Governments of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to get under the arms of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been disturbed by the US financial crisis: the three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the banking and insurance institution, which is also established in Hungary.
On the weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the representative of the European Commission's Competition Authority.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been continuing for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell some of its shares, mainly the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios already occurred.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a pleite.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion cost-effective American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the fortis stock valley ride.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested party with an objective offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the Chicken
Due to a person's drug consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs which in any case link the use of drug data to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the chickens to the fox" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance shall determine the fees and payment amounts in the event of damage depending on the customer's health and should the risk be too high, the insurance shall not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much more favourable method: Based on the identification number of the customer, he collects the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, which were bought, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medications, it could result in his blood fat levels being unhandlingly high, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurances only have to deal with the paperwork more, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as migraine and hot springs, as well as depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, whereas the aforementioned is not.
For the data collection and processing, our own companies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though omissions have not yet been detected.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them with the data on drug use. This gives them an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health condition.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal data protection law for health data, its impact is limited to health sector service providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been presented to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly refuse access to his data, as the insurance companies otherwise do not enter into a contract with him.
And so the chickens are only somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global Food Plan from Marseilles
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power which should be given more votes and co-voice in international matters, the Member States have not yet agreed whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and chief diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to close to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India were also legally consolidated into an agreement, so that in the future air transport will also be boarded.
By 2009, India wishes to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one India, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convocation of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides at fault.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, i.e. reducing emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
This was also agreed by India, as well as by the proposal to make some sort of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the convocation of an international conference on the subject of financial crisis.
The head of the Indian government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement at a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
The purpose of the agreement is to be adopted at 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 m2 exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives about publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is waning throughout the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small aircraft of the billionaire Steve Fossett disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's small aircraft, which disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a flight over Nevada's desert, was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely countered the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, on which a force was sent out. Now we have the certainty that it was the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (NTSb) noted that a team was sent out just a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, which identified the machine: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, too, some of Fossett's personal objects were found in California, not far from Nevada's border, by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long series of records.
In 2002 he succeeded in the sixth run, when the first person to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew the world in a single flight without a port of call with an airplane.
Among its numerous records is also a 15445 m altitude flight over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
GLK, the advertising you don't expect
A suv, which falls from the conventional schemata through its original design and special lines, the inviting surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe the sector.
Because of its extraordinary characteristics, the idea of the Suv GLk will also be unconventional, which will be shown in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different stages, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the car a special look: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear from the poster on which it is pictured.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new GLk will be illuminated in all its details in different moments, in order to reassess it as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes's concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of autoclame into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed to travel the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling after years of the Italian national team and which, honestly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
There have never been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The conveyors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia joined these groups in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, a truly right-wing fan scene, the one of Levski, now coincided with.
The Figc had made 144 cards available to the Italian fans for the game: all were displayed on names and therefore easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: there was no one among the travelers to Sofia with a running stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this respect, were thus refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified typhoids can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stages across Europe.
So our Hooligans won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation workers who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire has to be released immediately, and that will in no way give such behaviour the opportunity to justify," says the Viminal.
That's why, "Ought to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (sport supervision), on Tuesday, gathers the Casms, which can count on some of the aise, i.e. the intelligence services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Calle and the raised right arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (explainably expressed without joy) who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of François Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but no doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are committed in the country of their deed.
So far, this group has kept itself in check, but now we have to consider what has happened and what will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, there is no education ...".
