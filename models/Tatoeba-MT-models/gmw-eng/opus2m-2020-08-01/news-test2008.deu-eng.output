Food debt of European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro area countries, the rate of inflation in November was higher than expected - after 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3 percent, reports Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian central bank (ECB), the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the leitency rate. According to its discretion, the reduction in interest rates would favour rising commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment in the creation of an inflation spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the throttle: one has to "agree" inflation in order to exclude later needs for action.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in inflation in the euro area is responsible for the rise in food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the course for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
In 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnations, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the approval for the Socialists according to Gallup has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
In the case of party loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) approval of the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary heading of entry: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has worsened further - the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "pronounced bad" has never been high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families again see the change in their financial situation as pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only one-tenth is expected to be better.
A Gallup survey carried out in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - considered the work of the Prime Minister "very bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents generally have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who believe that one could get in control of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% were still in favour of the government and the head of government, this proportion is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would give their vote "likely".
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "with certainty" and a further 15% would consider their participation "likely". Given these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital day money.
Based on the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportions of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
This year, the hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area have maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have been "galopopulated" last December, the price of inflation has not been dramatically reduced, compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it is certainly a deterrent to consumers that what they paid for last year far below 9,000 HUF is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the studied markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, whereas the prices for puten breast fillets, nut and poppy were high.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but also there were 1kg of bread wakes for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price decrease of less than 200 Forint in the product.
Also surprising was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink, including a fee, cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison also averaged the most expensive, and Cora the best.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's "Napi" shopping cart prices compared to Christmas prices last year increased by 15 while Tesco and alsoan increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping basket last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1.480,00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1.206,00 Forint, but the rise in VAT at last Christmas prices was noticeable.
It is precisely this process that has seriously affected trade: it seems that the department stores were not able to decide exactly what price range to apply to each article, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were inevitable.
(If the dealer does not plan the speed of circulation of a product, he may fall by substantial profits in the price range which depends on the traffic intensity.)
The price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint, but the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284,00 Forint.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumer products in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: For some basic food, the Statistical Office noted more than 30 percent inflation over the period of 12 months.
So in about flour as well as in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has hardly increased by more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Clearly, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported constantly of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
There are bought out of all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets across the shop tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes in all three warehouses at the cash register when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only in food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are saved
Today, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals due to improper treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all the factors that are not directly attributable to the control of infections, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, the disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, an MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was a similar infection here.
The injury of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
Until 10 December this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System were reported from hospitals in 1094, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were certainly registered in hospitals, but the dark rate should be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as inflammation of the neck, inflammation of almonds, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are too high or used improperly, the well-responsible bacteria produce antibiotics-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weak, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or low body weight patients, these bacteria can cause serious infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital routine.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, ordered Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to Antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples taken too rarely
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable to reduce the development or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and immediately isolate MRSA infected persons.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practised so frequently.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the public health insurance fund for this investigation.
Therefore, most of the cases would not be possible until the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological investigations are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive of hospitals is not always respected.
Among the outpatients, or patients in basic care, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectant is separated from the disinfectant.
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is most often transferred by the care staff from one patient to another.
This is why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz further notes, in the financially less well-appointed hospitals, it even occurs that in disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly favour the development of infections.
Such infections are found to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Börecz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections in control cause health insurance enormous costs, so they will fight everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its limitation, was held in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to be one of its priorities.
The police officer was not drunk.
In the case of a fatal accident caused by the head of the XXII District Police, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired chief of police of the XXII District, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in the event of a car accident, was neither alcoholic nor drug-influenced, said Attila Morvai, the press officer of the Budapest Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he sat at the tax.
The former chief of police went to Kossuth Lajos Street with his own car in the XXII district, passing over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road in an unmarked place.
(Court of StVO, however, is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra strip, subordinate .)
The pedestrian has suffered his injuries after he has been transferred to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then returned its functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has begun its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be allocated to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly run in research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
At the meeting, the metro line 4 was also mentioned.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original Treaty and any modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is looking at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, but which is getting more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most sought-after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea there are Alena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also more and more in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior also attracts investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the extremely favourable area of Russians, for example.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offers highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, thus attracting tourists in the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two seasons.
Therefore, forward-looking investors are already buying in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, buy either revitalized properties by 50-100.000 euros, or run-down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group constitutes business people who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the rise in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss Bali's roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol has expired.
At present, a heated debate is under way between industrialized and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether industrialised countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment funds under the Kyoto Protocol are to be managed by a 16-member Council, likely at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6 percent
Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by the 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" was achieved successfully, or not. The Union would even be willing to work towards a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world and/or developing countries are also willing to meet their commitments by strength and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objectives of States that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 were a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU and its 15 member states had already committed themselves to a minimum of 8%.
The requirement for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will meet, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, whose importance also the IPCC, the International Nobel Peace Commission, has highlighted in its recent report the UN's scientific climate change committee, which has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would slow down the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which according to scientists would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertising on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: since March 2006, special units stationed in Afghanistan have been charging videos about operations against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
The film with miniature cameras shot on helmets is controlled at Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been considered more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defence headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population of the real objectives of foreign operations.
This kind of propaganda has been published almost free of charge compared to traditional television advertising, according to the defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
American advertising with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully handled, censored shots, also create the net - such as those that show the death of soldiers: the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films talk about the losses at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos have already been loaded on the platform from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but this "gatung" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, with the free downloadable shooting game "Amerikas Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-reliable simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Minister of Labour Mongika Lamperth is by no means narrow: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a working conference in which her staff can make the year 2007 clear with coffee and potash.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others have a magic Christmas atmosphere with tombola or start up in the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the defence department, but not the staff of the ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of Orphans" children are donated by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration", family members are welcomed by currently stationed soldiers abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The place provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
In comparison to other departments, the National Development Agency (NFTC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are hit by the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, with about 350 out of 600 employees expected.
While the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a tombola ransom.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The room rental was 1 million forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 guests loaded.
According to our information, a department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the experts.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the Minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo] it was reported: There was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self Administration are preparing themselves for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the staff in its own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Mongika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration, but to the annual conference.
One expects about 180 guests, who - the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration is done with 350,000 forint.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai is simply being launched with his colleagues only in the aula of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was estimated at 2,500 Forint per capita - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incitement.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the staff of the PM have been celebrating each year in this way.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the official speech of the Minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
On 20 January, the Ministry of Agriculture invites the Ministry to receive a New Year's reception, and this time the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is out of place.
The one hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"), and according to information of the resort, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions organised each year traditionally begin with a brief address by the Minister and sound with restraints.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will not be a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
No information could be provided at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment in question about the cost of the Christmas celebration.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is organised at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilised for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form its coordination committee for the undetermined duration of the strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the labour deposit will begin.
It is expected to be strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation.
A LIGA MOSZ Strike Committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and from Monday on, all the organizations that have joined the strike will be setting up work for an indefinite period, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will not be until the later evening hours, or at midnight until the vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strikes that begin on Monday will require significant traffic barriers: the railways will lay down their work indefinitely, and in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be stopped.
At the same time, there will be many roadblocks in a direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations have announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others are planning a fixed-term job setting.
Until Thursday afternoon between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the VDSZSZ railways could not yet be agreed on sufficient performance, although more and more people are on the train around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be working from start-up until 1 pm, at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9am, the LIGA unions will lay down work for four hours, and the teachers' union, i.e. the Democratic Teacher Union, have called for 2 and 2-8 hours strike.
The Hungarian Medical Association is developing an alternative nationally at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Unions' Forum for Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the league is that the government takes back the draft for the reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year onwards.
Claim number three states that the eligible professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ member of the League of Trade Unions has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "risk warning report" states, among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provocation of such a dispute, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma Hungary opposite".
It is thought that this would intensify the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guards, not least thanks to the enormous attention given by the local and foreign media, "has significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, in particular as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been constantly on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense" have been established.
"These groups are commonplace that they define each other as civil organisation, while openly boasting of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (terrorism protection, national defence, order prevention), appealing to the impotence of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further, all of this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to camouflage different political aspirations based on the political and party indifference of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is therefore not merely to avoid legal obstacles that could arise in the course of registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, according to some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries, in the development of the Hungarian Guard, the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (GNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the birth of the Bulgarian Guards were the Roma mass outcries that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents on the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organisation of "national protection".
In their opinion, in the past 17 years, a real "Gypsy terrorism" in Bulgaria has been noticeable, but the state has remained inactionless and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have initiated a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As has been said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats by organizing their own protection, as stated in the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and if risk-change trends are identified, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are precisely regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing the working days around the holidays has now been established, but the coming year gives us less such days.
In the EU and in America, too, something else is "feiertag".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and working days.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are associated with important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are unemployed days - the latter alone can rest with the New Year's celebrations.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the 1848 Revolution, and the 23rd of October, the anniversary of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20th, the founding of the state, celebrated on May 1st, on November 1st and 2nd, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has been laid down in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, to public employees and public officials.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays, are excluded.
Today, the working order is only a little confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life in this country will remain formal, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will take a time off, or the holiday that has been set aside for it.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be less redeployment during the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "put on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second redisposition is related to the holiday on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, one will have to finish Friday, October 24th.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of the holidays, after everything will lie and stand from December 24th, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive things to annoy fellow workers
Emails that we forget to send, voice news that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether one is accustomed to these small inconveniences, or if one is better able to face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That they missed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to make it right again by perhaps calling on the marketing department and confessing remorsefully that one had forgotten to send the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the thing is done with an excuse.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what you can really do to your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Lending something you don't own?
There's hardly anything more nervous than grabbing a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the notebook was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without any questions, there should be no lending from colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So don't put any envelopes or post-it in your pocket from the office, because it could hit you yourself: no one else, if you need it urgently.
You're talking about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a trade that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who, what's going on?
Where and why?
If possible, you should not tie the information (or suspicions) about the private life of your colleagues to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals to us his innermost secret, we should not misuse this trust!
It is best to keep silent as a grave instead of directing those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
No reason to report sick?
If you call in the office to report yourself ill by calling on tormenting headaches because you just feel unwell, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, indispensable doings, projects with fixed dates must now be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't be angry with my colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't make it to the office the next day, or that something could come in between why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are confronted with the absence unexpected.
Total, Chickens, Telephone
You have just been deepened in your work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud ginger of your colleagues?
Unwanted to hear a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
You shouldn't be talking to colleagues with summaries, singing, loud conversations (which take you over their heads), tramples, constant sluggishing, or narring.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (write, planning, organizing).
Are the other ones always to blame?
If a project is not finished in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, don't talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit one’s mistakes and apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to fix the mistake again, or how to catch up with the missing one, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Trainingshose and sleep: Comfortable for home, but nothing has been lost in the office!
Not even then should you dress so plainly if the workplace were actually allowed!
Don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress in the office accordingly - if you wish, also pretty and elegant!
Everyone wants to do it right - or how to be uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real jewel of sound a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the home music scene has not spoiled us with high-quality electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar equity is again "in" that proves domestic electropop: there are new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, played his own music in the band Yonderboi, before he – perhaps because a house doesn't have two peppers – began to follow his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when one approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" released their first album from 2002 among the top 50 local albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, named it almost the only trend eater in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but there was no interest in whether they like to wear this brand as well.
The band has responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression dates back to the time when Baláz Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the essential character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll, which corresponds to the spirit of time and the trends.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it a radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, which has been broadcasting pop music from early to late on, has gradually set the audience with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the help of six native singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "schichtmusik" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and innocuous, but they can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The willingness of the listener also works independently of this principle, languages and national boundaries.
hhg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twos going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They are following the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us the music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the impassable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: If you want to do it all right, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, sometimes quite apart from trying to interpret this in our music again and again.
We see ourselves rather as a team player who trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a slightly more popular style toward a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn't have any plans to write a hit, which is supposed to be a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought as a finale of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six female singers?
Why exactly she, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of talented soloists of the local music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized aptater "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls shape it?
B. Zs.: The song had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this song still needs something.
The sequence of chords has formally called for a voice.
I sang the melody that night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came up practically immediately and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember being quite electrified at the time, but it has also required the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: But both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage behind.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them any solo roles.
In the number it is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from and where we went, we simply allow ourselves to lift up these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into existence.
hvg.hu: What was the most exciting song?
B. Zs.: In musical work no one at all, there has been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything joined together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite album?
B. Zs.: This changes continuously with the concerts and even now, where I "let go" the album.
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraud brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless Frauder
Thus, his former employee, Jerome Kervile, refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It was almost EUR 5 billion because of it.
It seems, however, that Kervil was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and certainly was not capable of it.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He is psychologically rather weak," was heard from his superiors who showed him to the police.
But as evidenced by the words of Kervels published by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, he was a person who had achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros in his business at the end of last year.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already given the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already some initial news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had earlier payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kervel didn't believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Just when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," admitted Kervel and continued saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During all the interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that they do not get to the syllables.
He even managed to lead his boss behind the light, even though the Eurex banks were gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Did he fear flying up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk that much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"At my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being observed.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kervelt told the investigative officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the loss of this title at the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's let you
"That's like a snowball," he told the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew of everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I was making money, they closed their eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
One day he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for this.
When he got to work on Monday, he wasn't any more employees of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
Suspected by a holiday.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look at him in the cards," said Kervel.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the next few years.
This is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to obtain funds for innovative businesses.
It aims to attract finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The current money acquisition from EU funds of the Czech Republic is among the least successful new candidate countries.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year imprisonment for ex-Presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the Nigerian metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is coming back to grid is not clear.
According to Ileana Pérez, the chairman of the Appellate Court, it will now depend on the detainees whether to leave Alemán's sentence at home or whether he should be imprisoned.
A court four years ago pointed out that Alemán had regularly shifted money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is due
Yeah, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which was adopted by the majority of coalitions without support for the opposition.
The current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not therefore allow him to refuse.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a reluctance against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little respectable, yet highly significant law in all its peace.
That's certainly paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful subject for the media, and that is why they give him more attention.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The government budgets have suffered from three weaknesses in the past of the Social Democratic Governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure due to law, which is not only pensions but also social expenditure, which the "silence" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government deficit.
This budget is public and, in some way, under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to revenue from taxes, taxes and bank loans, issued other sources of investment, often inconceivably issued debt notes that indebted their town halls in excess.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying off these debts through large-scale sales of shares of the energy and other supply networks which they had received from the state on the train of privatisation.
Now this source is already mined.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For some years, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a growth phase, the ČSSD famous without neglect.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to bring public finances into line.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed far more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is primarily attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries which, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
There is therefore no need for massive social programmes which have unfortunately been inflated to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in deleting part of the absurd populist expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if, in the near future, there is not a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform, virtually any policy in that country ends, and no matter who is in power, nothing but pure administration will remain to him.
It is only slightly exaggerated when one says that then from ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop normal expenditure from being pushed out by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroners for 2008 would certainly be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was just going on.
If we do not want it to really come about that, from ruling politicians, purely administrative officials, then we must be patient and not too strong a coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees in order to want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for the gradual implementation of a balanced government budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the financial crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars will be added to the monetary markets by auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion to auction, while another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss central bank.
It is the first time that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to countering or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis after the 11 September attacks.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can provide," wrote Bernard Baumhol of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for his customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumhl in his report.
Banks have lost as much as 60 billion dollars because of unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what else can do when they decided to do so," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are concerned that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, credit for their customers will also become more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided after they failed to pay the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in the loan of money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks is contributing to the reheating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is said to damage developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus said again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he explained that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which represents a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that it accompanied, and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was therefore committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now, therefore, interested people could read his attitude unerringly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climateologist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was academic, able to understand and assess technical matters, had experience of statistics and was also more economic.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the thesis that climate change was constantly changing and that its changes were therefore normal, that there was no consistent opinion among the scientists for global warming, that the consequences of current changes were not too big and serious and therefore were not a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate were superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it to be an intolerable, other unproven view to be one who has experience with totalitarian systems, he sees it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and profit."
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers failed to change their old driver's licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where one can request the exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the roads after New Year's.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small places report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of tickets, the offices of the capital are overturned with applications, and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration completes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driver's license.
The exhibition of a new driver's license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Automobiles who do not make the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's licence are threatened with a fine from January onwards.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a warning to violate it.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, a punishment may also be imposed by the community, which does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has called on the offices to exercise their temper and to impose at most a fine of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns.
The driver's license is a document where everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not about a identity card that everyone, a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should issue their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent local office or to send him there by e-mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993.
The drivers must, however, gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kořařík, who are accused of having made common cause with the band of David Berdych, were arrested for 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a judgment of the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its punishment by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against the Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself is also accused in this case, the first instance is before him.
In other processes, however, he had already received sanctions of a total of 16 years.
He can't be sentenced too much.
A district court held 19 persons guilty in January, mainly because of participation in robbery, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants disputed the charge from the outset with the reasoning that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, inter alia, gave information from sources of the police in consultation with Berdych criminals, covered various robberys and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The band left Opava and Kořařík with 30 percent of the prey.
The indictment is about crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular for robberys, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for the presumption of office and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself by many million crowns through its robbery.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this procedure, Berdych and a number of others legally recognized as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's surroundings have to answer in another trial, and other cases have not yet been brought to court.
To date, the main proceedings have escaped Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in prison in Ireland and are waiting for their final decision on extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a delivery clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Třebíč wants to demand 12 million crowns compensation plus court fees.
For each of the mothers three million, for each of the fathers two million and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees with the Velebas proposal at all.
"We reject such a proposal, it is much too high," Dostál said after today's negotiation.
"But in order to be able to make an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need to draw up the opinion that the opposite side had.
We'll find out if it's worth a statement at all.
However, we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of years for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, an opinion based on compensation negotiations was produced by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts from psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men were better aware of the stress situation, even if they saw accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, do worse with the aftereffects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at Třebíč's care clinic on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must become a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far committed comparatively low amounts of damages, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight for the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not take part in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not terminated and his client will probably bring an appeal.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said after the trial Polívka's lawyer.
Everyone in the word "Walachian Kingdom" just introduced themselves to this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money collection and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute for money.
"After years they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to gain parasitic at our work," he continued.
Lucrative Business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Valachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him in 1993.
At that time, however, this was not in line with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to think of spending Welsh passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged, to which Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public on the "Manege" programme for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Welsh kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who had devoted themselves to him intensively.
The co-operation of the disputing parties lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have begun to abound, which culminated in the deposition "King Boleslav's I. elected to the Sankt-Nimmerleins Day".
The leading role then took on the suggestion of Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearness in the fight could bring about the battle prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to reveal details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush.
It was supposed to be something like the king's move in the whalery.
The King should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages disappear
In fact, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearing, the steering and also the processing could be referred to as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just keep revising my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of head freedom on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer there, because the body of the combination is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast Continue
I'm only going through the interior for a short time, not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I have objections only because of the small middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more designer design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and beyond are the times when we may be complaining about too short seats or headrests.
The side stop has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as the room offer is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combination, the already mentioned lack of head freedom has also been eliminated.
Case in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the loading room.
I have to call this (also because of the folding back window) very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They don't interfere, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in basic equipment is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains by clearly detectable 52 litres.
For a vacation abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading room or the very low loading edge after the rear seats are closed.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's how a 1600-cube engine should look that drives a family-hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption, and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes acts as if his exhaust were clumsy with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still going on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car again beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wiper trigger, electric window lifter and...
The car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you'll arrive at a very similar sum.
So just the decision to choose which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students at British schools is not possible
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even detect cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, shocks and robberies among students have spread to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended themselves by the boy’s insulting them with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene in a Slovak immigrant after attacking two minor girls.
The girls had claimed to have made racist remarks to the man and tossed him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his butt," a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the struggle with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks have been reported who came here for work.
Thus, some 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it will be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and captivating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an extravagant extent.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything in the USA was considered a crime (especially during the prophecy), was gladly seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high houses grew, over the broad boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as desired.
And the fifties' cult cars drive around Havana to this day, because the once imported Schiguis and Fiats in the salty and moist air have long since disintegrated.
If Havana, in particular its oldest part, has come down strongly, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial attractions as here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only have new hotels been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and attracts above all railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and the same driven narrow track to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion targets
The most important places do not exclude the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Just to mention that a museum is located in the already mentioned Hemingways property, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floor.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soils, which also cover weathered rock areas of dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her trade with slaves and sugar.
Wealth embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century that connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to make it unobtrusive.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the sugar factory valley.
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not keep silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba calls some the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, have to overcome high and disintegrated mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
Thanks to its pristine nature, UNESCO included these eastern foreposts of Cuba into its world heritage directory.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess themselves, about all this could be written many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allys in Afghanistan are passive, claims Americans.
Not enough soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the United States, according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to Minister of Defense Robert Gates, should draft a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not take place according to their conceptions, on which the representatives of the countries that were stationed in the south of the country were agreed in Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating States are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense minister Robert Gates, called for more activity to the NATO units, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in increasing development aid.
"In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start their own development of the economy and security," says British defense minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has, according to the American army, reached the highest level for five years.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke.
"I am not pleased about what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the agency Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the participating countries as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for being passive.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the battle requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghanische Nichtstuer dettartent: The Germans make games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will be raised to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a public debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to go into debt with 159.2 billion rabbits this year.
However, at the beginning of December, thanks to the better development of the government's budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they thus increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they fell by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the government debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state was indebted to more than 111 billion crowns.
"Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we will probably cross the border of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crown," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
It is similar to Vladimír Pikora, analyst of Next Finance: "We could come to exceed a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it appears that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take up to 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he said.
Growing Debts
The government debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government debt is financed by debt statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has now risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The government's foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average government debt maturity increased to 6.5 years.
"Over the year, the total debt rose by 13 percent from the first quarter to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that growth is particularly marked in debt securities, where growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt increases, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the handling of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to take on 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of December, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is mainly due to the government deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kronas, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and interest rates for European Investment Bank bonds of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent disfellowshipping on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum.
The Briton was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She'd have deserved being whipped.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was taken home on Sunday and, according to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, was accused of insulting Islam.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher invites her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Muhammad as the favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbon's Muslim colleagues, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to make her come too close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name , he thought this was just an innocent mistake .
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the class.
Consider that the first name Muhammad is also the second most common in the UK, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of worship to the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo have ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is unfortunate that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status , said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called for their commitment to maintain peace, and continued discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time , added it and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of conciliation on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% of Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika had been commissioned by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their conciliation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a common solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on stronger autonomy
Regrettably, no agreement could be reached , announced the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden , where these negotiations have been held in the last opportunity since Monday .
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovarian rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province shared his regret.
He added, however, that the Belgrade-proposed plan of autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, on the other hand, felt that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence by the province.
Belgrade believes that it has a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be made only on its own in the Security Council, where its ally holds a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
Only a decision of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that Kosovo's Parliament would have the last word on status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence would be carried out by the Albanian-speaking population in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush elicits an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, said Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the timetable for peace, which they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority under Abbas's last resort to a peace treaty aimed at clarifying all open questions without exception, and including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly concerned with: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were expelled from their homeland in the present state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
According to the President of the United States, Abbas spoke and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide a regime for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he committed himself to conducting the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to making an effort to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli that exist alongside each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received assurance from Bush in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led to a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it is attacking the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi Prince in his interview with the Arabic-speaking daily financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Police Disciplinary Office (IGPN), a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm.
He had no use, but was on strike, and drove 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorbike of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, so not released for public transport (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmets, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its drive from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control carried out at vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (forgone wings, split windshield, torn-off bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the main district for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she is excluding the responsibility of the police officers at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident who were heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely, that this small motorcycle came to their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday showed a kind of rilling, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, that the two vehicles had been cut together until the police managed to brake it.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical review.
The body names of the two victims were observed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, as a result the police had left the accident site very quickly, and without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious mistakes concerning this matter.
According to a police source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations which require further investigations and where it is necessary to be very careful .
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people who telephoned fourth.
In view of the tension that had quickly developed around the events and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police from colleagues who had arrived at the accident site were taken away in the car.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police did not help the young people.
These young people have been helped first.
The fire brigade came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her , the prosecutor emphasized on her part.
In Pakistan the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police beat down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf announced the emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades employed by the regulatory forces there.
Those threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad the lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by oppositionists, advocates of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (Mitte) and in Peshawar (Nordosten).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement was given the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers to judges who opposed the emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to make his position on the legality of President Musharraf's reelection in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chauthry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to issue the command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the vocation of the emergency, declared on Monday by the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform until 15 November, date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections of January could be postponed.
The Pakistani government also denied the persistent rumours in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pills users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
With one of five couples even calculated for the month exactly, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the room station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A bold exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts to perform the repair, has produced several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony from the spacecraft Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon take in the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-tonne module for the generation of electricity via solar panels already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew took up the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And at the same time, one of the collectors, who fold like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to harm the collector any more.
The astronauts who had originally left Discovery for a control course and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the spacecraft attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, it has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old learned doctor was thus selected to operate on the injured solar collector.
After carefully reviewing the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey racket wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar panels that produce several hundred volts, had invented and crafted the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded up before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the spacecraft Discovery to start the flight back to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the Group of Aviation and Defence has announced that they will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counteract the residues of A400M, the stock EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007, referring once again to the residues caused by the slow development of the engine of A400M, which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounted to between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Based on these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results, without adding further details.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the business performance of the EEAS fell from 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the costs of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the mass of the Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very locked election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message to the voters on the public channels, which has already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the leader candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Cremlin Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything go of it when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to deliver a new attack point against the West Powers who are accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the prize of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they were wrong.
It ploughs a campaign of election stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-achter Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorised demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections, two important questions arise:
Who will be Putin's successor as President?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot succeed in a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the Almighty United Russia Party, which will elect the Government and President?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovietus, they are not master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kossov of the State University of St Petersburg goes even further back: the bourgeois society in this country, which was christianized five centuries after Europe, has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin once again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully adopted by the population, all the more so, since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but rather a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians for free waive the personal responsibility they have shown in the short term after the collapse of the USSR.
What are you thinking about?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
The conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor, is that what remains to be considered for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to redeem them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not yet been understood, except with a humanitarian intention, that is, individual and named, that is to say, on the request of a former victim or his family.
The 11 States entrusted with their administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the USA - agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Hot Information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to carry out research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, prisoners of concentration camps and the state of health of forced workers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been brought together after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subject to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen more than 300 permanent tens of thousands of personal inquiries are still being processed.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, had declared in 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will bring the two economic areas enormously forward and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion each year and services worth EUR 10 billion, Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission’s Deputy in New Delhi, said, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso will be present.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about limiting the current recurring concern about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time , the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December , in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , in a communication .
The Bank continues to state that on 6 December 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation at 12.15 GMT, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE is putting liquidities into circulation in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its Communication, the BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures to obtain the interest rates of the interbank loans, which vary from day to day, with its basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has commuted to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with fines that the banks had prevented from taking advantage of.
According to certain rumours, enhanced by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion for the sums that were circulated by the European Central Bank.
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of PS, of which the majority were for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIP fleet, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which, in some cases, gave rise to violent exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances that had been examined by the Assemblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 said on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 Acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most renowned festivals.
In 1989 he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production of the license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been to, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working together in parallel to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are actively working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission were motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Chicago Grand Park after it has profiled itself together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival in 2002.
The two events in 2007 amounted to 9.8 million dollars and 11.8 million dollars on gross tax returns.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas the unspoiled are more likely to take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to convey at the same time the impression of a rural festival in the European and one city in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes it.
These lock tests are among the delegates' tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is suing the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the first priority is to present the cinema there at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shakespeare hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock market facing a final year rally? Dispute among the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
The investors are already rubbing their hands with just under five weeks to the financial statements on the stock exchange in view of the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot produce certain forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market normally goes hand in hand with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if tensions to be taken seriously determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not endorse such a strong increase in price over the past few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the liquidity of the market and market participants, which, due to the lack of secure equity funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which is strongly affected by the upward trend towards high yield assets.
As a result, in the opinion of these experts, the stock market will be more likely to have a more lateral market-induced trend, especially because we cannot estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. note bank, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of an increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a risky time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8th of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
In the view of Juan Solana, Analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional annual grant of the pension fund.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasises that this year things could develop slightly differently; especially due to the final year rally already held in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments on the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a short-term deviation from the index values which depended on the effects of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values to move the Ibex to a new maximum.
Solana by Intermoney suggests that this year's great values are in line.
The expert would count the two large banks and some real estate companies as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha assures the Bank Inversis that the increases in the banking and industrial sectors will go hand in hand.
If the Rally actually exists, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, the market situation will be determined during the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only in small numbers in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed two drop in course rates.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the so far last real-year rally.
This year, the Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, showed an increase of 6.68% in December.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally will show up.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the strongest economic regions in Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group, the jump dares to extend the opening hours of its branches from 10 am to 20.30 pm a day and start on Saturday from 10 am to 20.30 pm.
The BBVA group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement that will close 75% of all branches on Saturdays and open them on a weekday afternoon, although not for customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to the business opening times, will depend on the experience of the popular bank.
And that's also the intention of pursuing the popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their situation, can capture the commercial clientele of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank would like to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, since they are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The expansion of the opening hours is linked to a new spatial design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but resulted in increased staffing, since a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The establishments, which will be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name of Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches, the model of the BBVA is not used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to compete for our customers, Rivero explains.
They have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the end of the stock exchange. The channel he led had increased his value by two times his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: That's exactly what hurts me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has been reporting a total loss of 40.5% since January so that its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million; in the case of Prisa (editor of Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518.53 million; and at Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Unquestionably, the question arises to what extent we can actually operate stock markets at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced his intention to rise to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for the better distribution of Telecinco is that the analysts see the high payout ratio that the company could have up to now: In 2006, Alejandro Echevarría led a 100 percent dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that the ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have always given much more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of the end-mol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 and 5.5% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurity: focuses on its high efficiency yield and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buying) as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market a more favourable position than Antena 3 (hold).
3rd.
JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate).
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
At the same time as the parliamentary elaboration, which today ended its meeting with the Senate's decision on the supplementary/amending proposals to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing both regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members, who had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation to ensure the safety of investors and to regulate the individual business activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, MIFID, which redefines the securities service regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows specialised firms as well as natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting companies that are associated with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
It also increases the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions so that the regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to announce the priorities of their business profile, confrontation and handling of risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission subsequently proposed further changes, and the decision that the titled debt securities must now be regarded as a complex financial instrument for the investor due to their high risk level has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
The entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the fields of work of qualified economic operators was also used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation was adopted which restricted the fields of activity reserved for economic operators.
The Senate, in turn, set new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator who works on a foreign account, does not require the authorisation of CNMV and its services for the commercialisation of products and for the acquisition of customers can offer several investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare local and quality to US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up in advance by using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) recommended that the indicator established in advance should only serve as a benchmark, and therefore should not be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However , in the halls of the Congress building , Solbes noted that even if the current number is not good , the inflation gap between Spain and the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
In addition, he explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , announced the Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs in view of the forecast published today .
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the Bank had requested emergency credit in mid-September of last year's crisis, and they now account for only 12,000 million pounds (this corresponds to 16.800 million euros).
At that time, the assets of the Bank amounted to 25 000 million pounds, a sum which has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customers' trust and will continue to decline despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the name Virgin Money, will have to bring about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be made up of the assets of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to achieve its target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make 50,000 million pounds (approx. 70 million euros) flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named the Virgin Group this week, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of developing into urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently MP of the Partido Popular and at the time Chairman of the City Council of Totana, and could, according to information provided by the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wiredriver of the plot.
Officials continue to search out the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
The lawyer of Juan Morales was also accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information provided by the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and thus privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested in leaving his client's residence due to important taxing documents to be associated with the plot.
To this end, other sources of information report the alleged order payments of Morales to a Galician building company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban contract that decided to build a 200-hectare area.
Eight people are currently in detention.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidate in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will lead the list of PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a election of the Socialists, will take over the office of the Congress President.
José Blanco, the PSOE's organizational secretary, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
In the view of the head of government, the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would appear to be joining the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of the Congress, who last November announced that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, finish his career in public policy and instead work for climate protection in the university area.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the government had constantly pushed his return to political events.
Moreover, he pointed out that, as in the appointment of Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party would not want to keep citizens away from who would take over the position of the President of the Congress in the event of a election, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the board into a house of respect and not insult or business, so as to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time one gets the impression that the only place in which one cannot speak quietly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the government president in the Senate was once interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and suggested that he would not appear to have already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is critical of both the skeptics of climate change and those who are in the foreground of a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than fighting Islamic terrorism and even proposing a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him into need of explanation regarding the action or non-trading of his government, which has made a decisive contribution to the fact that Spain is at the top of the EU's position at the top of those countries that have at least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for non-fulfilment of the specifications, to which sectors this is due, and why did his government, which had proposed the contract with the planet, not stop this development.
Moreover, it is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take against climate change.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of citizens, which individual and collective savings measures must be carried out and the economic consequences resulting from them.
More specifically, those who have to sacrifice themselves and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will not be any such explanations in the future.
It's because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE's proposed petrol cent appeared to be so dangerous as to be forced to take the proposal back.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns does not have to speak, nor accuse, nor demand, instead, to follow the demanding edition, to adorn the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not indicate that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to a supposed development into urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, which belongs to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office, and a hotel contractor were arrested for suspected of city-building violations, it was said today out of investigative circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and where he was located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal building line Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the arrests in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid that took place last Monday, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undecided building ground for urban projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should be built on the site 4000 apartments after the local administration had given it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first Totonas Court.
The first six prisoners were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, Juan Morales is also identified against the former mayor of Totana and currently independent PP member Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is to act as a subgroup of Nuaria and have received the lubricating money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Guardia Civil Central Unit, whose representatives made eleven further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, which should have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the town belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to realize a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a price designation of other names with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us yesterday the comment published in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; by the way, it happened that the issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a Abiturant who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview by the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the president of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical position towards Platon and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the sub-level curriculum for philosophy in gymnasia.

A colleague shall inform about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of law, which would involve six months of imprisonment.
However, if you are robbing a music business with a value of 400 euros again, this is only considered to be a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business of up to a value of 1000 euros, then while theft is classified as a crime, the penalty is lower than in a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you choose a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to take part in a beating than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a withdrawal from freedom of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered less severe than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorisation has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has raised his demands quite well.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of them.
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of the Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research centre Life&Brain, activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and thus got the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Balkans prosecutor
Carla del Ponte, for eight years, has relentlessly pursued the criminals of the Balkan wars. Her office is located in the public prosecutor’s office of the former Yugoslavia’s criminal court, located in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave their office with a crying and smiling eye, as the chief responsible of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - is the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosan leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be on their feet.
Their names are listed by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, as a template for the title of his documentary La List de Carla (2006), not yet started in Spain; a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her project of tracking the escaped criminals and putting pressure on the governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
The car insurance scheme, which covers a possible injury caused by the driver, includes a high cost of which is again dependent on different factors, including age, gender, time of the creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
To own a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we're dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which determines that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged, in return, to submit the corresponding settlement amount in the event of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance undertakings set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments are due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the undertakings, these tend to be fewer accidents than single people.
The benefits attached to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance must take a number of points into account.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance most suitable for his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points to consider in the selection of an insurance scheme in order not only to be able to make a performance choice, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds, when choosing a low-cost insurance scheme, encounter numerous obstacles, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for the ideal insurance protection to complete a full cash insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full-scale casho with self-interest, so that the benefits of full cash insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred by the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium , which is higher the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera , the principal representative of Spain at First Europa , an online insurance intermediary .
Another option is the extended insurance that assures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
When you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce the cost of insurance; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty includes an increase in the said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on society and its earnings.
If the company has a high yield year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the driver to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
It is therefore most useful to opt for a full insurance scheme with self-interest.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and in the event of driving, the Spanish head of the European company explains and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been cast.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not own children to take out a full cash insurance; of course, only if it also allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of insurers, married couples with children are regarded as customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently their contribution payments are low.
In this case, full cash insurance with self-interest (with an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is appropriate to complete a full cash insurance with a self-interest (for an amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance, which only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, one must insist that car insurance is very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require that a thorough selection be made which corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow is hoping for the eighth finale in Milan
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack on next Tuesday in San Siro in order to achieve their respective goals even before completion of the Championsleague pre-round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the Scottishs decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a final decision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that the FC Shahtar with six points does not pick up the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of the group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time for entry to the final on the 13th in the semifinal.
Thus, this group will be completed before all others and the dissent at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be at the expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would have a better starting position in the eighth finale in the event of a winning group star.
The Gordon Strachan team might even be able to win a defeat in the FC Shakhtar in order to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost (2-1 last week in Glasgow), but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to miss the Scotlandn evening. The resurgences hope to reach the eighth final of the remodeled Champions League for the second time in a row after having been defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-game period (1-0) and by a zero to zero finals on the play.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, since both the achievement of the eighth final and its membership at UEFA depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European Championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus compete at UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls in Vancouver, Canada, gave the start of their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold out stadium where a video of the band's history, which had provided for Furore in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appear in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage that had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice , the English football player David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the fan masses in the audience who glowed the GM Palace, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star had not even got our wardrobe face to face, so I'm already very excited about what he'll think of the show.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later the group's disbandment, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of world public had changed that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also made it known that the disputes had been resolved and that they had all been very happy again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, as reported by the TV station CTV.
On arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is spreading between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being affected.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% in addition for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said Ukraine's Minister for Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changing price of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-punity register for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish public health service had no accurate idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the European Economic Area, following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transfer in October, and was burdened with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the appointment of foreign employees in order to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review prep records, the Agency does not have the power to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines from the criminal register extract, which helps employers in the field of controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some staff documents, they have not been routinely carried out," the report stated.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines to a great extent before employment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland-Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the run-up to the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current preliminary tests of the NHS Scotland function well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was probably higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who had left indefinitely.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely respected.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for controls prior to the start of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was concerned to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding control investigations would be reflected in advance of the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Award Award Awarding
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has received five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.

Nevertheless, he has presented two prizes to Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously best known for the cultive cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best director.
Rock music was the focus of another prizewinner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strommer received the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, who is in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize, which was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"They were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my guy, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prizes, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Niggy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned a forthcoming attack on an oil plant as well as on the clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells would have planned to smuggle missiles.
All-Qaida sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man-powered rapid intervention force to protect plants following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an interior ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a " rocket expert" who had emigrated illegally to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, 22 more of the prisoners had planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaida, who want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida Milizen consider many of the clergy in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policies of the royal family that dominate the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida, born in Saudi Arabia, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have it in foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last five months," said a speaker from the Ministry of the Interior to state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to advertise for "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is more like an averted twin of the earth than was previously known.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
Billions of years ago, scientists believe that the Venus conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth could have been inhabitable today.
But because of the unblemished carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sun exposure and a slower rotational pace, Venus took a completely different developmental course.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, which has examined the plants for a year, provide a sobering view of how the Earth could develop in the face of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the head of Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment."
"Enriched Uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material reportedly enriched uranium was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he didn't think it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally agreed to put a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters would record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who questioned democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, exactly reflected this time the state of the Republican Party that will break into the elections next year.
It is not known exactly like the producers of CNN who supported the debate, who selected the upcoming candidates to show YouTube clips.
However, during the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest dedicated to a single subject, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a suffrage when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed tips of approval when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The evening's sharpest and longest exchange was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed himself forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to shake the reputation that he had been indignant about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having hired illegal immigrants for work in his home.
The two were particularly concerned as a questioner whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesia" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to follow up on this subject.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but they both stay in the race, perhaps because they used to be harder and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: stronger borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears of toxic toy from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible was his preferred book, perhaps he did not literally believe the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was urged to support them, Jesus laughed at them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donations and his applause storms in the debate on Wednesday.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet agreed on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly combined with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkler to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall down; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No title seems to have been sold, no political Paris hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has hidden donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the call for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax-based loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative plastereries.
A trio of retired generals started a revolt in the upper house in protest against cuts in military expenditure: to be ministers of the armed forces, they claimed, being a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and her former Head of Achievement) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown will stop irrevocably in the direction of departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to rule.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to fall apart; the cabinet ministers are beginning to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his Chief Lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax authority documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's miscarriage - as in the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party funding - the voters may assume that he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks.
The errors are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely dizzy.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new thing about political donations is a good example.
The garboesque of Abraham, who compares his donations with his nonprofit gifts, says he does not wish for public recognition of his goodwill.
That may be the case, but he was not allowed to decide on it.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, he says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will naturally have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial driver, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But Brown has not yet been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping a known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - to make the measure full, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned from are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, which has been unoccupied for six months, and to move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a partymate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; it has two years to win back voters; and the only way it can achieve victory is through unchallenged equity and solid competence.
Map shark
Is the credit crisis on America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that back fins are whirlling excitedly around.
Now that America's real estate market is lagging behind, predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection from underfinanced loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the payouts and the spot rates, which measure the proportion of loans which are not recoverable or are too late for each period of 30 days.
The HSBC has announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer finance, partly because of the weakness of credit card users.
It's too early to panic.
Losses and fences are still low.
According to Moody, the third quarter spot rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
In part, the deterioration in the Councils can be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US Private Insolvency Law in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn account for a large part of the cash card losses; the number of applications (and hence payment fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports on solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the downside in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the volume of expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to accept credit card debts, now that home loans dry out.
The card issuers, however, look at the flow of money instead of capital, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
You can even benefit the card issuer.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates are reduced if real estate is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, the credit card debt among the repayment priorities becomes more important.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexible than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones' main financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more serious future.
Keep looking forward to these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of finance of Enron, Andrew Fastow, turned their requests into guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspirator with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to cut off a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent enron-making companies that contributed to tearing the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under the control of Koppers acquired the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others, according to the charge, sold some 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty in two charges of conspiracy for his role in the Enron's pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a penalty of three years and a month in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was on free foot on the basis of a $1 million security deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up billions of debt or weakening companies seemed profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling has a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were annulled after he died last year for heart disease.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of an airplane of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, a four-day orgy of the show's consumption, which was organised in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had built exhibition booths, hoping to interest newly created Russians in everything, from mahogany-coated yachts to diamond-coated car goggles that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully visited a shiny orange Porsche at the next fair stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's little money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at its times of shine.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to Europe in crowds, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab pilots of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the world's most visible free-for-money issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold noise.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, which have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are second-class, worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private property in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they move through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothing, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the new empires, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in a jam for several hours to visit a cosmopolitan warehouse, which would be admirably Cadillac Escalades, pocket knife from platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears together.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, the patriotic at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaics.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers from millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two 70,000 dollars mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that high-end cars with high-end alarm systems had sold the glaring orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which is the same with connected chain bracelets, for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a routerad.
The cost: $22,000 for a quadruple.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Karpetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British model, which were stuffed with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaires trade fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw the piles of money around, mobile phone photos, while leaning back in the midst of the substitute wealth, being cut by friends, or simply putting a few million in.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Puppeted surgery suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest thank you when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and observed an ambulance at the white Cape Cod holding two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the doctor's bodyview," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings found out that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a trial carried out by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what has caused Ms Arroyo's death, and are hoping that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and stubborn," said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephon interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, leaving two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose shrub stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian calls behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from Haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped to find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to the rise in world share markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm down the credit markets by further reducing interest rates, were reinforced by significant comments from the vice-chairman of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Central Bank, said that politics must react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down Checkable Markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences would have "partly some of the improvements of market functions from late September and October vice versa".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and to stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest-rate reductions.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street, in view of further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2.6% and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, credit pressure resumption on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank, which were granted to the European commercial banks, had been given significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed other capital into London's money markets increased when the three-month loan rates were seen to rise by 6.59% to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England faces decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who should beat the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electorate, on call at least under this special title, is here to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, gradually fills himself with applications for national electorates, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth beater position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to nail exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to get up for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers should be promoted with good conclusions that know the business well.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a major influence on decisions, but they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket and a beater must get regular chances of order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself to be healthy and how the wind cones into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still fighting to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough a significant testcricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
After a further discussion during today's web session at the Asgiriya Stadium, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will probably follow their conservative instincts and abstinence for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debuts in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six by Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against twisted bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, along with his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beat, which was still manifest in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a lot of joy in life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket square and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently missed a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call on his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this remotely, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit with him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be there well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus shipments of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have run out, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, in relation to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces back to the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, had helped drive Al-Qaida out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaida mill in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many have said that they have been attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the US force increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens", which defend their districts armed and in cooperation with the American military.
But more were said to have been forced home by visa problems and fleeting funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, said the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to stop giving them a visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were driven out of Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have dropped.
There are fears that a sudden inflow of refugees will revive sectarian tensions and conflict will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this slogan places the smallest federal country self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of Saarland, which is in fifth place in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries on the basis of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring the Saarland to universities in an above average number - many of them without a degree in the gymnasium.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his degree qualification at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points higher than the Federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively widened.
As measured by the population, the second best in Germany is the dual degree equipment.
Despite practical training and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"In general education schools, we have started some reforms after the first Pisa study," says a speaker from the Ministry of Education.
The government thus introduced national comparative tests.
So that the children start learning earlier is free of charge the last Kita year - a model that is now also copying other federal states.
Whether the pupils' performance will improve in a sustainable way will only show future comparison studies.
In Pisa 2003, the share of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
Bayern is better expected.
And to the dismal of the Saarlands, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is compulsory on gymnasia - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks around
In Venezuela the clocks are ticking in the near future different from in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez has the timepiece turn back in the South American country for half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is now a joke figure.
According to a new law, as the Official Journal of Venezuela stated, the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that is not available in any other country in the world.
The U.S. hostile Chávez founded its decision, among other things, that the United States of the world would have imposed the division into time zones for full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia because of a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oilland have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which were about the release of hostages.
Uribe had spit Venezuela with his decision "in the face," Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ring will make for Furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken to by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American Summit had been horrified by the constant calls of the left-wing populist and had taken it over his mouth.
German Threat 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are forecast to be losing real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could really expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the increase in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New burdens could also come in the case of unemployment insurance against workers.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that price explosion in food and mineral oil products has driven inflation to the highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent per year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its anti-life atmosphere, Venus is more similar to what has been thought of: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds of the Poles, as they also appear on earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has proved - it sensed electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primary soup theory", lightnings have created life on earth: thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on earth, it sometimes has temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's will, but it's a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the basic question of the esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties no probe was specifically intended for the exploration of this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles do not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbor planet with Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa reports.
In addition to the already known whirlwind on the north pole, the researchers also found a cloud swirl at the south-east, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the earthly winter hemisphere, a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmoca writes.
The second-inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is nearly as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns around itself much slower: a Venus Day lasts 243 Earth Days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds of the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both of them gathered water, which remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate stones, it is the most important of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel from the accusation in protection, pursuing a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not distanced himself from the traditional one-China policy.
That also knows China," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown displeasure about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from a number of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "windows policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor's Office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
In addition to inviting German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), the Chinese leadership has frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministers of both countries, according to SPIEGEL.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other modern provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against scratches as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of scratches like in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social dissatisfaction from discharged into the streets in Germany, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: German Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments after the heavy youth cramps in France.
"We must ensure that we do not build up social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
Federal Government, countries and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it would be too early to be warned.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there are no urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police in the last night.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In the face of the blacks in France, Kolat warned against "imitating effects".
The situation in Germany is not as critical as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age was "over average".
In particular, more training places must be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than France, "social control is taking place in the families".
Many youths with migration backgrounds also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, "But we need to be careful anyway."
It was necessary to give young people a "quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter was flying over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning dumpers and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of around 1000 security forces has been a source of peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
During the night on Tuesday, around 80 police officers were injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night the unrest took place on Toulouse.
The convulsions were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not guilty of the death of young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The remote appearance of the chancellor documents that the coalition is in the end - and that nothing more can be expected of her herself.
Which country does this Federal Chancellor actually live in?
After their insolent appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and low in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by it.
The accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy has rejected Angela Merkel with an extremely high rate.
That was provincial, she said, and only showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented clearly for all how much their accusation applies.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a retired politician who flees to foreign policy and himself remains in danger.
For example, climate protection: because it praises itself unabated for the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how to achieve the climate objectives in this country.
At first, the self- praise - so much immodestness the CDU Chefin had failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flakes that the upswing arrives in people.
In doing so, she damaged her image as a Pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking about the world.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, internal political problems are a peripheral appearance.
Child poverty and the anxieties of the low earners?
She's got a few side notes left for it.
It is significant how often it promises itself when it comes to the payment of the child.
Three approaches need Merkel to bring out a half straight sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attacke Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard hit exchange - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already exonerated on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
On the other hand, he contends with heavy accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," says Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blew the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-filmed 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than a keyword.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," says John McCain to his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, receives a lot of reading from the Vietnamese veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated, as torture.
However, the fact that the main themes of the campaign are now beyond Iraq’s war and torture debates show the reactions of the hall public in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium is pleased.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney, and before the base and television audience, he is abducting that he was still among the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the fore when he, in his opinion, is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil society
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was defended as president.
This will lead to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was defended on Thursday for another five years' term of office.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby bending international pressure especially from the USA.
Eight years after his invading power, the former general now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Shortly after his oath, Musharraf, according to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will remove the state of emergency and thus fulfil another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the suspension of the state of emergency in early November, had rejected all the opposition to the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
Fathers of the herbrock return
Germany's supergroup of the Seventies is playing again: the three band members of Harmonia made their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival a section of her great time "Live 1974" appears.
At the time they were much more famous abroad.
The dreamed sensation then takes place in the shape of three men placed on the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a flower-white shirt of 63 years.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
To the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a conventional piece of music.
That seems not to bother the gentlemen themselves.
That the band is playing Harmonia again has caused some excitement among herbrock lovers.
Here you can reveal: Targeted questions revealed that although the name was confused by the collective pop memory, it was by no means so long-lasting as to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is called misleading herbrock in England and America was always more important than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo prize for the life work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003, it was seen in questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the wonder did not know any boundaries.
At concerts, Michael Rother later clung at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the declaration in the stranger is one thing.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony, because the trio existed only two years and in this time a much lower power of action developed than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Rodelius had already performed under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
At first one played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a record label entertained by the Church.
Rother had briefly helped with the power plant and then played a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, who at that time might be the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the cluster musicians to exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-fleet municipalities.
Less ideological than in the commune of I, where Rodelius was still allowed to tease as a nanny.
It's more like a pointed artist's date.
It is said that there was also a lash of the vocal association Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name.
Some people held Harmony of it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so calm and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice served not only self-finding.
The CD "Live 1974" now released was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-member record scene, as someone believes to be imagining.
At the time, Rother wanted to force harmony and occasionally to practice it.
For Rodelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric sphere and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than it has ever been Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining herbrock as an independent German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Rodelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
In order to outline the entire range of influences of the herb rock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the empty space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most special sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
Legendary formation is used to project further black and white photographs of wirr wir wir wirte equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again dealing with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to unheard-of sounds to the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the Technically Deeper Tüftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, sound clouds are hustled and erased and sung in a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music universities (can), technologies (powerworks) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and harmonies cannot be brought out of it even now.
The most natural thing is carefully covered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of nerves or cause you great happiness in fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mortal Peace", two films again deal with the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and ball or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but only there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many no-necessary roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism drove out a longing for attention.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunter" (Why do film titles have to be always so long and weird as Lokführer's fare contracts?) anyway.
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching representation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has been behind his very best times, but who himself, as a ruinous monument of his demise, preserved considerable remains of former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Mortal Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serb from cosovar hedgers, one of whom falls in love with them immediately.
Although it is welcome that not once the Serbs are presented as the sole root of all evils, the remote-looking film loses itself too quickly in Geballer and Action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a motorway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored in an exemplified way, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who come up to track down the Serbian chief war criminal "of the fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and screenwriter (both in personnel union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are a bit dazzling: both times little teams go into the woods to accomplish something that the military cannot do and both times it will be a journey in the insanity.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply let be the downgraded cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script still has a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream, if the reporters manage to do what Nato, CIA and all the world's top-money hunters did not do in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to the righteous revenge.
This is so bad that we want to call on the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to insist that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to be in agreement here only) not to carry out the persecution too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good mean and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I feel like the swollen foreheads, meaning: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they indicate how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all of the Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film either.
Almost always: if a star is drifting around the world's crisis hosts or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to film a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will still mature - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated as masterpieces in any way.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on equal two screens, even too much about the world's conflicts.
And this robs the scriptwriters of the carelessness it needs to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "the great dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how badly the Nazi regime really existed.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps one must have the sarcastic distanced artist's view of the Romanist Lawrence Norfolk.
When the question was asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "That's just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered and war will continue to prevail in Yugoslavia."
Criticism for Olympic Absence harvested by Beust
The removal of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has met with severe criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a ban on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sports policy momentum could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which comes from a changed ray of time".
Mayor Ole of Beust was left with earlier statements on Wednesday, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports League," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund's expected decision on an application for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich for early December.
"This preference for us means that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have been thinking of until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed out for all time, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
"It's too early to grow a chance by burying the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
Furthermore, a relinquishing of the application is contrary to the statement of the Head of Senate on the occasion of a reception to the general assembly of the Allgemeine Deutscher Hochschulsportverband.
There by Beust the application Hamburgs for the University of Hamburg in 2015 had called "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had not nominated Hamburg as a candidate city until last week.
The SPD Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleine Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has placed on the Olympic map and left out the housing building," said the SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Kleine Grasbrook always called for integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU had set one-sidedly on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had caused a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Those who combine the terms Sweden and the wooden box think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently in Sweden wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxen of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has made the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, are copies - and probably most of the more than a hundred Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard carton of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - presented hundreds of broillo boxes from cardboard: these were (for cost) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, it was their role as models, it was merely works of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted the permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time have rightly entered the art and auction history as an authorised original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than 100 000 dollars at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 and that Warhol had left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three of Swedish private owners, two of whom were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press records were first grounded and flattened, and white oil paint was then applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the colour with a painting roll was applied directly to the press plate without a foundation, and that it is not oil but acrylic colour.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the "heavy accusations" raised in the matter of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, one has been shrouded in inexorable silence.
Rebelling Soldiers in Manila Give Up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers have given up, who had taken refuge in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Governmental soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tears of gas.
The about two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday because of a failed coup in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to start suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, were apparently overcrowded to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the prestigious hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who earlier ordered the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main venue of the tried mutiny of some 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 Euro, as reported by the company on Wednesday evening.
One now holds 20.05 percent of the basic capital.
An acquisition had previously been speculated.
Keep the option open to increase the proportion of slats.
With this step one wants to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
Previously, on Wednesday, the Berenberg Bank had already received estimates of entry, after its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator increased by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The moneyhouse considers the shares only to be a third party, it was called in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already participated in the mobile company Drillisch with just under 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5,15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31,4 million euros.
In addition, companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet speaker.
The two companies set up the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of more than 10 percent of Freenet and do not use their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept themselves open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The long-term and hard-to-understand poker around Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German Telekom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connections customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the freenet shares so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another 4 percent.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
