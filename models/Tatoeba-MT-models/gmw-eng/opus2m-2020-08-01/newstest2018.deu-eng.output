Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It's a crazy institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the tunnel is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.
Munich's oldest official map promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying if maps aren't up to date.
That's what everyone knows before, because the car-navi instead of a surrounding road showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlas, an offer from the Bayern geoportal of the state government, are anything but current - but therefore very informative.
Especially when comparing them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flick carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were included in the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian survey administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and resulted in the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: It was the present neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to drive the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Survey Management.
The original positioning sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of earlier/today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as a district of Munich.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, there is nothing more than fields - at first glance: in the zoom of the park, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered floor pieces from the so-called "primary" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer prove farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was indeed still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In today's Au-Haidhausen district you can not only read the street name "on the Gasteig" or "On the Airs" as well as in large letters "Irren Anstalt" in the original position sheet.
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße you once blocked people with delusions.
In 1858/59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Luften" was established.
From 1872 onward, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chaining of the so-called errors.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from applying violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working on the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients there was room at first, and later 500 places were expanded.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular institution in hair 1905.
Since 2006, there has been the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatricies.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football ground of the TSV Munich East, east residences from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural form based on the home of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as the main square, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies broke many holes into the city center in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a grave chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn-stammstrecken took place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored Persons has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missouriians to pay particular attention on travel through the state and to take extreme care, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the Group's opinion states.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it more difficult for people to seek discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel left during the trip through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Advocate General of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are held 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees of what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring deposit money or let relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profile.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weed fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two delegates at the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendmann family.
Markus Schwendmann initially provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as well as houses holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, Black Forest milk is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendmann.
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the pasture fence project "elementary important".
I cannot profit from such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, much has to be done with the motor sense.
"We have to fight with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendmann.
In 2003 he took over the parental holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not run a organic plant.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The commune has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the leader support".
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of between 3000 and 4000 euros per hectare.
It is hoped that the land will be restocked for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized because of the promotion
A total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced through the pasture fence promotion in 2013.
The area of the open space is thus 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was paid over Leader, a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
The farmers therefore remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the durability of the fences," explained Schwendmann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job, without farmers and farm women, you can't do it."
For Peter Weiß, it was also clear: "The best food is produced here".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote pasture fences.
The objective is to keep the Black Forest open.
The existence of a funding facility designated by the LPR is a prerequisite.
In addition, the fenced area must not be tug-manufactured (over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently under way, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs amount to more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is taking place the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Freedom in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the importance attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller Acosta insulted: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is about contemporary resonance to the insurgent words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "eleven waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were performing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a classic imagery.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exilants.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this a long time ago.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom is not a invite, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the night-nighted world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States."
It's pretty unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.
The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is in the truest sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Let her torch not light the way, but light up the hatred that is her only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilith Doyle remembers a time when only two Scottishs were part of the UK team
The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Championships framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland something special has to be developed" and the United Kingdom's athletics have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eilith Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether Scottish or wherever they live or train, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilith brought in naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will take part in her fifth World Championships at the 400 m-hurds, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scottishs are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The Muir mid-range runner is on this path and last year has set five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot to watch after a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other shot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on pods.
As far as my speech as Captain is concerned?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from our being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics via Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate heating voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from internal policy to its political principles.
He cheated on the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led to the slaughter like sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that early this week.
The governor's staff released the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playfully debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not proficient.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hatred crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea either, when a number of people comment on the same topic, then they are ignored by some rather than so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "preach".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest demonstrators and silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for accusing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voters from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect to that of the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers responded to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who left the Archerfield next to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and serves as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it reaches its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is an eerie champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great display window for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the campaign at home.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went."
With the trio on the field are the former Masters-Best Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking costs £ 5 per car with one passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"Our estimates suggest that 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study manager Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 cases of lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are a bit in time," says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since in the underground much is hidden, which is not stated in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and lockouts is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was blocked and only the buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been busy with the work on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite strenuous.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cooled tubular is removed and devoured with frigid, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
No fields were assigned to her as the youngest of the four wives of her husband.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagemen are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares walk around the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the crew by a public manual survey.
An existing movement that arose for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is öde. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and of corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mayo Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"Before, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst rates of infant mortality and literacy in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these empires are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $20 million to local military members and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gooses and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highland in the 1970s have become a genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything," says a report from the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strokes are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese maintenance cantines sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in Jayapura Province.
"It has cost the local Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokovi in the People's Party, promised to address the inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the President's Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Yokowi's initiation in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - in the circle and a bird song initiating - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to tow stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said on the porch of his colorful wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, according to his cousin, who was witness to the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "safe" their station because they were being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks Jokovi in Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Secretary of Security Wiranto said that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crime against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with gross disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at village dwellers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between village dwellers and the manager of a construction firm who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravian Douw, who was drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Insurgent villagers protested at the company's office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Domingo Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by incitement of sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested in recent years and arbitrarily arrested, under the pretext of "safering national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially notes and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can work out four or five fields of sweet potato each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting of international media remain strained.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokovi's election campaign to remove the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - invited the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the Group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, a democratic system is still in place, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and oppressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting but would like to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Yokowi again.
"Yokowi is a human being who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairwoman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Yokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice to Yokowi as a "debt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai gun victims carried out a last symbolic act of spite: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never be given justice, but at least they do not let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through on Friday in one of the tallest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre high 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which is by chance called the Torch Tower (Fakkel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we stood up in the fire alarm and in the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters, a resident who gave his name to George.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire and cooled the building by 4.00 a.m. local time (00.00 a.m. GMT).
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the disguise, the outer covering for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that the system of records for insulation and disguise on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has come through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but very much appreciated, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was just missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our memberships have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
One will continue to work to improve the competition.
Not even for the vote, after many oppositions, had already come before the proposal to present the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: In the following year, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host rights in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings banned items into the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned items smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent entering the plane, while they carried accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had been late in discovering that they had been traveling mistakenly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately carried by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying objects with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately banned drugs in the aircraft.
The company said it had asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through airport security and how many would have done it deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most former smuggling goods - knowingly or ignorantly - through safety, were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of which liquids they may take or how much of it.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the largest quantity of the objects seized by the TSA are the prohibited liquids.
For a while, the people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far neglected that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glamorous number of the latest quarterly accounts: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often advertised over the past few months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk now admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit".
At present 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it is expected - all models combined - to be 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are now 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-bindingness of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPO CEO Pruitt withdraws to reduce emissions due to the delay in the Obama era rules
One day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the environmental protection authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of Smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline which expired on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump was the prosecutor of Oklahoma, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden reverse of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround in Ozone Standards simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In earlier administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on a sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress insist on a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Advocate General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The return of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging Smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists rejoiced at the changes in the course of Pruitts.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to obtain this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer ourselves to pollutions and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church
750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Mountain Church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether it's idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors Tumlingens their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique pious little thing."
In 1267, the St. Hilariu chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg book of documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold the "mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, on the Tumlinger Berg there was also a court of glory, to which the church or the right of the patriot belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there.
As indicated in the description of the Hoofamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the town of Tumlingen, was the "mountain" of the third, the administrative centre of the village.
Ancient maps from around 1600 support these historical events.
Patronatrecht was founded by the early medieval law of its own churches.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it.
This involved the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the window panes were struck and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was out.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpits and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The rest of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left to stand.
On the New Year's night in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only today's tower dwarf was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen will invite them to the St. Hilariukapelle on Sunday, July 16th, on the sixth Serenade in the old cemetery.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
President Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program will begin at 6.30 p.m.
Intake is from 3.30 p.m.
For the sound of the Serenade there is an environment in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers present the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance to tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and promoters Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenad organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants approval of windwheels to be checked
Boisheim sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the council.
The association "Boisheim Wert sich" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time of the date in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone results in an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.
These zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the town of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days before by changing the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"As a result of the lack of a legal basis for planning, the approval decision granted is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is going to be."
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the City Council decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Recognises: "This means that authorisation for the construction of wind power plants is not required under planning law".
The circle confirms receipt of the invitation.
"This letter has been received by the Viersen County since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them on the occasion to review the matter again.
However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the Kreis did not want to comment on the contention of the association "Boisheim ist sich" on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four per 200 meter high windwheels.
Last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved, signed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-sen households.
The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crack together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The Landesstraße remained blocked for more than hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, with her passenger car, accompanied by her 53-year-old mother, drove the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weeks
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September.
The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to lure the inhabitants to shopping in the city center.
As the president of the Trade Union Association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of what offers their own city away from the usual supermarket ware.
Thus, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite to the "middle shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the closer region.
In preparation, advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, says Christian König.
Urban administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The commercial association and the city are going to another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the fountain festival and open Sunday for sale, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
Moreover, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone should help to revive the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was worth overcoming the Lethargy with a network that had partly widened, had King said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that on the third "home shopping" day in Germany, five Thüringer cities participate for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day was "to promote the appreciation of local trade and to highlight its importance for the common good of our cities more strongly," says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence his direct environment itself.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US School
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New more people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) there was still a injured person in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
A first missing person was later found dead.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday period, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for the payment of the border wall after the tactile transcripts of telephone calls
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump called on the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nito to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President insulted him for publicly accusing the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and swore to have Mexico pay for the project.
The transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the US refugees, who emigrated to Australia, would be "unscrupulous", "must" and "dummy" and that the existence of trade, which was communicated by Obama's government, would make him look like a "deep" after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Activists re-establish racist Lyncact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and ran to Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates shuddered in fear.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screaming tears the silence when a young black man was torn by the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, played on July 22, is just a replica.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience was really sighing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were led by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It is really inconceivable that no one person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organisation of the replication.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of Georgia and a life-long civil rights activist.
For him the replication serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want to end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to maintain justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A court physician lays a bedcloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained on foot for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom a white landowner, Barnett Hester, settled during a fight - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and hid the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulates it even more coined.
"It was a right-wing massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, then this will happen to you."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene led the annual replication of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their representation is vivid, gripping and is founded in a kind of deep racism, many of which want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to see and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynchen because we'll be confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of blacks - pushed themselves into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Green co-director here.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, who screams at Hester and oppresses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get out of my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?!" said Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still tickling.
"I just don't think white people said "a--he" at the time."
"But," one of the other black actors swirled.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that's where the energy shifts in space, a feeling of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman clothed with a funeral dress stands over the actors' bodies and performs Billie Holidays' mourning praise "Strange Fruit".
Their voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers wipe out sweat and tears.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just came down the road.
They have experienced Georgia's pressing moisture every nearly eight hours when Brooks leads her on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song are out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children clog on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair from Atlanta chatted about the replication with a black couple they had just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What that really does to me makes me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said he had already begun to plan the performance next year.
"The replication is in a way inspiring, for it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we don't learn from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf focuses on a colorful frivolous production in front of gigantic six-storey backdrops.
The swivel stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows an optional sleek street corner, including the Berlin Wall Rest and Dönerbude, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Prior to that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rheindöchter pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which runs through its "ring" production.
The three Rheindöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tear a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful dirty hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oak) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel Raute, are also celebrated.
There is great applause for the Festspielorchester, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in army clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was eagerly expected.
Had he had to have a valid pipe concert performed over him in 2013, there was a great jubilation five years later, in which the single "buh" ruff went down.
Feast director Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this.
"It is noted that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a certain way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of its view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Quelle works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their voluntary year.
Where's anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at school in the open whole day.
How are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
You're now 26 years old, so you're a late-time volunteer.
How's that going?
Lot: I did Abitur.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there's an insight, you can see how it really is on the spot, at the focal point maybe, too.
And was it?
Quantity: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, I'm probably doing a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office, and I'm studying in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not something unusual to have several different places of employment during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from the age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, it was exactly the right thing that stimulated me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering?
Quantity: Well, this isn't about calculating statics.
You always have other people who have a completely different story behind each other.
Whether a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family, you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of touch?
Plenty: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments too, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group said that it would reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company faced.
The job reduction, which Director-General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to his previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
In May, in a third cost reduction programme, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of a further £300 million (394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had reached an increase of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato-Soldat killed in suicide
A suicide victim has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, reported a declaration from Nato.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the Qarabagh incident.
Bombardment is the last act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide victim killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement states that the explosion took place on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised force carried by persons".
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani in recent weeks.
EPO reverses decision to delay the Smog rule after actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has lifted a decision to delay a regulation of Obama's government, which requires States to limit Smog-induced emissions, one day after 15 states sued the Agency for the step.
In late Wednesday, the EPO announced its decision to advance the so-called "Ozone Provisions 2015" and said it was showing the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPO to measure ozone emissions in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the set-aside of democrats and nature groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "may reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Council of the Community
In the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common area in the future pension scheme.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing property part was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time for the area belonging to the church community to be owned by the church, there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors, still in the boat, has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council advocate that such a common area should not be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of senior residence, but as an open entry into the community.
As an example, the word of the "krickcafé" made the round.
The decision by making available resources for the current budget in the past autumn will be supported by funding.
The construction is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area, reports Tjaden, would be eligible for support by 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision provides for the investor to be informed that in this respect he does not want to put a nugget between his legs, the finding that both saddle - which is based on the construction of the environment - and pult roof - would be possible, which reduces the height of the trauma and makes the construction economically possible.
Unnecessarily, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean that addition.
If it's helpful, he's going to pass the body unanimously.
It's not that easy with the Community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which one does not make the right progress, and now one leans out of the window at the common room, she says: "I am hard to do with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to wealth or even foreign investors anyway.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not grant a grant, but gets a real countervalue, in case of doubt, is the opposite.
The request for a split-up of the proposal for a decision is supported by three advocates.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we take the decision in this way, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Cycling is dragged on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car and seriously injured on Wednesday in Garath.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on his bike on the Black Road from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A passenger driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenin.
The man was dragged to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a carriage.
FC Bayern Munich has to give up on David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game sauce against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The staff concerns with the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 o'clock/ZDF and Eurosport) at Cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
In the duel with the BVB, coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to abandon David Alaba.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
The Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing.
Ancelotti has made the physical state and the lack of balance in his team's game responsible for the five defeats in the last six test games.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding, "the most important point is balance in the team.
She wasn't good at all."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team's ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "heavy, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wander in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "star trail" is to be created throughout the country.
This is planned by the St. Andreasberg Observatory.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It connects nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to place panels along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "goodly accessible installations in five to six locations" in the upper resin.
In question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Starpath train will be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines more strongly than another, although it lies much further away.
It also shows the constellation in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has operated in the Bergstädtchen St. Andreasberg, the highest-ranking Observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a naked eye can be seen clearly from there.
Since 2003, there has been something similar in the university city at the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads with its stela up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as a "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipal equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stables with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures at least 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planet's path is about four kilometers.
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomakenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing battle in the near future below 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hall to greet Lomackko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for-Pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomaakko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm at ESPN.
When the pair posing for photos, Lomaenko manager Egi's climates noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I am a former spring weight," said Garcia.
"I went up for Broner [on 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down on lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give this to them."
Lomacko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climates asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomakenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 Knockouts) which also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans asked for it," said Garcia, expressing themselves openly later on in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomacko as "a huge fighter", and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomakenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks he's seeing the Riverside Tripartite Champion "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the Ko-Aus".
Garcia said the focus was to show impact, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomacko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured after tire-placer
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were partially injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 16.30 a.m. just before the service station on the market, probably after a tire-placer.
The car slumbered to the right in the bush, where he crossed over and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2-2 season start against Braunschweig that the optimization of defense formation will bring points to Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season, with the result also, if not the two opposite gates had been against Braunschweig in 2:2.
"These were two counter gates too much, and we need to be more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the Erzgebirge, the tributary is also to be further optimised.
And a gate after a free blow doesn't want to catch the forts either.
"For the future it will be so that no one next to Michael (Rensing) will be on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also do better with the experience in preparing the chain of threes, than with the fours chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we're currently in the chain of three positions on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"Requirement is, but we're still more harmonious and we're not making so many mistakes in the structure."
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether one can speak of a failed start after a dispute, does not know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"But if we can stand there with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season start."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped early for a storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, saying that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a top favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know as much as 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the defender of the Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a light favourite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance in just one defeat against aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and superfluous."
And so Funkel doesn't want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are over 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rattsmedicinalverket) has begun to carry out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migration Verket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old".
The tests shall only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results in recent months are stable.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are pretty constant," he said, "the Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "propose that the person examined is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they were 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To assess biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he said to Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of an adult child being incorrect is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is less than 18 years old, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport in the government presidium Freiburg.
In April the works started at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is observed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a arched bridge of concrete covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.8 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve feet long and 10,60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning has now received on the north side a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge fixation, which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path is supposed to pass.
The particular thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertips have required the laying of pipes through the construction in Lauterbach.
There is also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
In the run-up to the work, residents were informed about the project by handbills.
In addition, fish and cancers had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the construction yard building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is controlled by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher village entrance, the street is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole country is financed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull on a line, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what is difficult to put under one hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "great campaign start".
And well-known names at the start - as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and Deputy President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on-site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A world and one of the key organizers, is really happy: "Doll how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including a "ur German potato salad that the AfD could eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcano Eifel reported that he had tried such an event and received the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for a request in Daun, but there was a rejection because of the already built Laurentius kirmes there is not enough parking space.
So now the rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
With regard to the event on the Rondell front square, he says: "That is the good right of people, mainly, it remains peaceful".
This is also what it does: Around 8 p.m., a band on the Rondell front square provides entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to give her speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the front court have a longer breath, but also there is a few hours after 9 pm to clean up.
The police can push off - no special events.
Trombone Hits Trumpet
A rehearsing with Wolfach's trumpetist Frederic Belli is in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German training with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo singer of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as well as with a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This central part of the program was only premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'."
The Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was Robert Pattinson's "Twilight" colleague, who eventually became bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I'd played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and believed it seriously.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered especially in school when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared, and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Mother, be proud of you!'
Especially the public don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to act in a certain way and this is annoying me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the public as a whole."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement to the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least-legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, final message," said RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
On Thursday, Sebastian Coe, the world's head of athletics, praised what he described as a clear excuse from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-entered into the sport.
Russia's athletic chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF convention on the eve of the world athletics championships that the banishment of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found indications of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself has recognized that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reformed."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to re-establish Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Olympic Championships starting in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still working freely, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, North Hesse, about 1,000 people of the two were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security arrangements.
For the unexplained cause of crash, Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) did not say anything.
But she called the two killed pilots "Konners of Her Trade".
"We are bowing down to this highest victim they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought on Thursday by a guard of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At first, only the members of the church left at noon.
After that, the celebration began in the circle of the family, close friends, from representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The guests of mourning laid down roses, the families stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operation of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not turn away from the crash, then nobody would have been able to do it."
Doubt at the UN mission in Mali, Minister of the Leyen did not show: the mission was dangerous.
But he is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr made no mention.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The husband of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was reported by the King's House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in Roskilde Cathedral Church.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already prepared a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, as stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is to be buried is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a locust of his not being happy with his title.
After the enthronement of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prinzmehl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not view himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will finally be, be still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for over the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always flew the sympathys of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy standing in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was floating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the country's day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from her country group in Lower Saxony had led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a severe crisis.
Five months before the official election of the Landtagswahl, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-voice majority in parliament to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
The former Green Deputies Elke Twesten founded their step with the non-Nomination for the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler would recommend that his group include them.
This means that CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new country day will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil believes, however, that it is essential that the land day decides its own resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Land Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Land Day will withdraw the confidence of the Prime Minister and choose a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities have to be tested legally cleanly," said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace if they are properly examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a follower of black-green.
The Greens asked the apostates to return their country mandate.
"Of course, we assume that they will return their Landtagsmandate, which they have received over the green land list, with immediate effect," said the state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group president of the Green Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extraordinarily".
It has decided deliberately not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green Deputies Elke Twesten to CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red Greens," wrote the Federal Head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the Landtag.
The exit of Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests ahead of the welfare of the country," criticised SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue and tries to beat political capital from it."
Lower Saxony's head of the CDU Group Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MP to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the party of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
At the time, the CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD, and SPD and Greens had a thin majority of one voice in the country.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxins, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp printing.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Foodwarnung.de, the federal states are setting up the latest information on the affected egg councils.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at present, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissancer is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade has to be done as well as manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe from health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0,005mg/kg, they are not transportable.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, it's not the businesses that owe it.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production plants are not directly guilty.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to suspected illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few control staff in serious cases.
Is there only a lack of staff or a solid responsibility?
It was the official checks that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 percent.
This is why a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to have a complete investigation.
Is regular alarming in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By means of the tried-and-tested means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the position of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This requires consistent and high-pressure work on all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar can sign it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich family of rulers of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to pay back with legitimate sources of income that enable them to score the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from the concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, Clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell into disfavor by the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive expenditure.
"Certainly FFP is not dead, and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of the proceeds for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements of EUR 44.4 million.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, has met with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 season Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outlaw their financial supervision by bloating its revenue from companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not make this a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup Organization Committee in 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to comply with any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, told the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a club, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new schoggiliferant
In recent years, chocolate has produced Frey Bord-chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline is re-subscribing the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott, at the request of the news agency sda, confirmed an appropriate report from the newspaper "Nordwest Schweiz" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier of Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
About 17 million small red and white packed shoggiboards distribute 14 grams per year to passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Sectoral insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwest Schweiz" to CHF 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But all the more important is the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious contract.
The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers will be eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey intends to try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate tiles have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, the customers of the First Class are spoiled with treats by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class wet passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolate Frey is also distributed on the short line, both in business and in the Economy Class.
athletics - Diskus-Olympiasier Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the finale.
His brother Christoph, Olympic winner of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup election and could only look at the discus competition from the gallery.
Also with the first attempt, Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niches in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stifling at the heart of the Gag - actors of middle age play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults playing now adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting pot principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Swings the Cradle").
At one point, a character is bothered by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The adorable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy and evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lipbar of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random insanity that could fuel this franchise like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series, until he achieves what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the resurgence of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West Ring War iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas as a director created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka indicates to be a TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-assed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Uliki, whose dialogues are synchronized with Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful Gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes it moves, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a lower length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a situation.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger story and with hers.
Hit drugs mafia in the country
The police hit the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as reported by the Konstanz Procuratorate on Friday.
15 defendants aged 25 to 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, Konstanz has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large stake was also accompanied by four Palermo officials.
In particular, Italian nationals were closely linked to Italian mafia.
Also an incident in Hüfingen on 27 May, where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the gang.
How to complain of large gaps in the foreign register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the Ausländer-Register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misconceptions in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government refugee management officer Frank-Jürgen Wies has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign central register.
Weaknesses in the data recorded there could lead to " partially serious misconceptions" in asylum proceedings and deportations, warned in an analysis that the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" has available.
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are included, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In some cases, data from 1921 have been found, "by people who are no longer alive long ago, or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
"Inaccurate data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
In addition, the statistics on people on leavers include EU citizens who would not have to leave at all.
However, such false allocations led "to a distorted debate about dealing with those who were leaving the country", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children when they arrived from there.
This can be seen from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF carried out such procedures "regarding families with children, with the exception of infants and infants, to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually impossible, the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU are responsible for achieving them first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that State can send him back to the country of entry.
For the reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also return refugees under the Dublin Agreement.
The interior-political speaker of the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of illegal reception conditions and a threat to the child's well-being."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichbach has already been provided for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who, with his now 100 donations, now shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the community honours the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is awesome how our body is set up for this and we will respect the donors who provide their blood for strangers, yet unself-helpful," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single donation of blood helps several people," explained the circular leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canneds are decomposed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in spring.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK circle leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umber were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave off their juice ten times each 500 milliliters.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "rewards" as it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthening pressure.
The Bank's monetary committee (MPC) political decision-makers voted 6 to 2 in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members reaching an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But it signalled that in the next few years interest rates would be needed to reduce the inflation caused by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut Economic Package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to make available cheaper financial resources to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on household real income continues to burden consumption."
As regards interest rates, it repeated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "a bit greater" extent than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".
The downturned growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the expected increase in interest rates and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank will recover slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report has shown little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small increases in salary, as the increase will first become even worse before it improves.
She added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot "prevent" income loss, but she added that wages will recover clearly at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for UK goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the drop in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fall in the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an interest rate increase had increased as inflation has increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and it will attract again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2% was "all" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again, as the lenders are eagerly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those with existing deals and new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) should prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight at the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposition prophylaxis (PREP) taken before sex can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, now supplied by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeals court had confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was greeted by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "deciding moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to all of England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PREP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PREP by collecting clinical evidence as it is widely used, received and implemented.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is targeted at needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, resulting in the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PreEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow-health minister, said: "The beginning of the PREP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PREP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help to bring about a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of large apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the Duck & Shed architectural and design studio of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were piled over each other without having to bend.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but rather putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms above each other in full height - with much extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide room for all the pots and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweighty, so if you push the door up, it'll slide very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform into something quite amazing by means of good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one third.
A court case states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed deliberations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, had excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, whereby Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when he left the company and Luke 26 million dollars.
Both Luke and Mark were bitter, so Paul says "about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has held back very much, although he was a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much," because the case is in front of the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with executives on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that was coming into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television lasts decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he had a fair reporting of positions to convince," said former election counsellor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's Tweets had even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have already managed him to keep trouble away from him several times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is determined to find out where they came from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Barchefin Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of shock or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General, Rob Porter, " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is asked and hoped.
The police throughout Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally unknown, clues from the population are hoped and asked.
Europol reported on Friday the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" adventure calendar of winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, it was called Europol.
21 postcards for criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests could so far be arrested, at least 11 of them due to notices after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the 'millionaires series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again standing on the foot of war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a tomb drawn from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the Millionaires series.
They brought with them horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a grave dug out by the Council in order to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have pressured the Council of Solihull, who said that "it is useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, were moved on and are back now.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long lessons to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be mentioned said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area."
A speaker from the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the police of Solihulls. We are taking the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise becomes
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise will be.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be re-opened on March 1st next year.
These are good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then ambiance operating company mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 nights of accommodation were lost at the time and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, given the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at that time.
But mainly Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of interested people at the house at the time.
He should keep right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Joy City object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Your name is Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for some time now, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially mined, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is remodelled, new windows are installed.
Later, everything was to become "beautifully close to the citizen" as Thomas Scherer expressed himself.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to rise wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, Scherer.
The city's ideas are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly the level of investment.
Less than a million euros, he expects.
The outdoors are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.
In an courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Friedenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affaire: US Special Interlocutors employ Grand Jury
In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The panel had started work in the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step to be a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified its investigations.
The CNN station reported that there were already first invitations to the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have long accused Kreml of interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there was agreement between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The aim of the investigations is to focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to Mueller, more and more Trump’s private and business environment was also exposed.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Interlocutor Trump had personally moved into the centre and questioned the accusation whether the president might have hindered justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to file charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments.
They are usually switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite persons to hear under Eid.
According to the CNN station, there have already been pre-loadings that focus on the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting had been asked for a statement, as stated in the report.
In addition, they should provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then head of the election campaign Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday night in the U.S. television that the establishment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
It should not necessarily be said, however, that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the file of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign for its political opponents.
" Russia's story is a total invention," Trump said.
The topic gives the Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But he usually also worked in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that have been taken to speed up the work of the Special Interlocutor in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the president.
There was no reason to believe that something had changed, it was stated in the statement.
Mueller had only been used after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this noise, accusations against Trump had become loud, and he had wanted to hinder justice.
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigations against then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.
It triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.
Unlike an independent special mediator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice on the pressure of the President.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws that could not be released so easily by the Special Interlocutor.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg driving in Antarctica
In the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has been dissolved from the cranfish.
This was reported by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus over a trillion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometres large now drifts north and will probably take two or three years until it melts.
It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in demolition of the iceberg is unclear.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice pellets in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
So far, the Coloss has been part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Shellfish swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this cranfish, the balance of growth and demolition was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete cranfish has been destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It is important to note that Larsen-C-Skelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under stress and may fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key.
The melting of shellfish and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and disperse ice as much water as it results from the melting itself.
However, the loss of the cranfish causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, Larsen-C is the fourth largest shellfish in Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now entering a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether Larsen-C-Schelfeis would grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not bring the demolition of this huge iceberg back to climate change, in recent decades there have been a lot of ice-creams in the Antarctic Peninsula.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic peninsula has warmed by about three degrees, counting among the areas in which the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants house rate at the staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy free positions, the CDU calls on the employers' association to leave it in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the County Day give 41 new jobs to the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching institutions in the circle are apparently very desirable.
Around 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied posts at the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are being sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the administration is to "design a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to combat the shortage of candidates in the future.
The overall concept should focus on the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for cross-border beginners and include a training offensive, calls for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known in the past.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, a high number of employees who leave the service as a result of illness or old age.
So high time to act so that more jobs do not remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Volks, head of the CDU's political group, goes beyond the common proposal with his party.
He had recently caused a haphazard surprise in the circuit day when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and surprised the other parties.
Peoples want to see a review of all the possibilities that allow for the withdrawal of the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should seek a house rate with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local cities -", says Volks.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining system actually provides.
The salaries are currently exact, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, where employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone to NGOs rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rescuet' because its team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The auxiliary organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself on detailed accusations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations that are currently being filed after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board tubeboat migrants who will be delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting is said to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential changes or obstacles" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate Organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti has said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Risings and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Austernposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachtenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The festival and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There were points of view, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate forest and the in stock plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day, Bad Dürkheim went to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point reached the vantage point, combined with "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days there were again many meters of altitude.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the outdoor inhalatory breathed a healing brine.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural -.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is ready for e-sport
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of sweating in the wind and weather over the stadium grass?
Fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga associations that are increasingly involved in this field.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later the FC Schalke 04 followed and last the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire very new target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure that there are still several clubs on this train.
On the next weekend, the FIFA Football World Cup in London will organise the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be more often present online in these markets than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
In the E-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2, "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competition level.
For the longer term, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, E-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of habit.
Ingo Froböse, too, has long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reactability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Checks were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientists highlight positively the high integrative effect of the e-sport.
Players are on the road internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the company consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
Sales in three years are expected to amount to 130 million.
This is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the German football league.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or hockey", the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already more international.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition provider Unikrn.
Some things are happening in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, football first leagues are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB Board of Directors Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the ancient times, is not enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the club, but at the same time aligning the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains the same as it always was."
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all the federal states are now affected by the scandal of toxic eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all the eggs out of the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken into the shelves, which are shown to contain no fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemns for the texts that force Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been put on trial.
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appointment.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes pointing down when she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't repent."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "a terrible circumstance that she completely regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said there was "no day when I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "purchased" by the realization that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer to have this only person I have been with every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, sneak yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered that she would benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
One of the few defenders of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to murder for her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bayern
It's no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to be captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern dares the Confed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation does not harm it.
There was something different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made the binding to him stick to the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner, after his first engagement as a Bayern captain.
Well, the understanding could have run better than 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also be interpreted by Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of the C-Elf as a youth player, debutant and just out of vacation, but he.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep with the mood.
So if you were chosen to enter the inheritance of Lahm, a small extra motivation can only be used well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini-lam.
Right behind, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did her remaining.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this start-up formation like the one that can best take the rower in hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed force.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (almost hardly worked); Renato Sanches comes out to the devil to connect to the performance of the Asia trip (only due to the condition); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked very well.
Sules ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to be successful a few times in the construction of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not the way we hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance during the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also brought."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new entrances is seen following the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed after a few cracky statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
With Bavaria you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba Motivates Public Health Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our Public Women
Austria's best-known football player has signed up for Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB Women all the best.
The Bayern-Legionary is almost clubmate of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fiebert with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhine-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy on T V request, and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan setting procedure, and the building law is expected to stand by 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West umgung Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Road Plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Minister-General Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives for a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
Furthermore, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees in the new Masters bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the existing Master's exam and 2500 euros is foreseen if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master's training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is fast to create facts, and at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to recruit Wissing at the state-owned mobility, 29 have only been employed so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations that the country invests more than 20 million euros in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering to see the country's growth in broadband so far.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed network supply in an IHK survey only with the grade 3.4.
They complain about increasing Internet connection and demolition.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the Pro Wind wind power company.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months it had already cleared up the field because of disagreements.
Audi is said to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350.000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company felt that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and that this involved prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles in European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install facilities for neutralising the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of havoc on the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen errors that could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices to comply with the requirements when a car has been tested but return under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been accused, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to avoid emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To ensure that the Isar visitors also participate, a raft will pass through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If it draws to the Isar again on Saturday, it will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not an ordinary raft, with Isar-tourists.
But the Baureferat wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is ..." the understanding for the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild flow.
Last summer, the raft passed over the Isar, and this year too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a reckless and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's garlic and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon artists, the cloves of his figures are his trademark.
With 85, the Argentineist still draws and works on a film.
His message: laughing, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he went through, among other things, as a drawing artist for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round-round Mordillo figures abound in drawings with the Slate Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still sitting at the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches continue to be widely distributed throughout the world.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-foot as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird to me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions which are reminiscent of drought and insects that are transmitted due to diseases, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And it's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include a better water distribution and the slowing down of the evaporation from the ground, but also spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thüringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Crests, sparks, merchants, vagrants or a national slave camp are to be experienced in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meets on Wednesday to review its plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office that was the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary to provide perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the paylist of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest stop from violence, and while the bodies abound throughout the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nito took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and her instigator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoke building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal attorneyship was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all mistrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoles for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of being unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after seizing another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the intoxication problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard - hit investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeanto TV.
"You have to take over the task that falls upon you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbor worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine ruin?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions on how best to accomplish her work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, "It's a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mixture of random smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s staff met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition on government expenditure, which focused on the governor's home city.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was commanded when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption because of high-ranking cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Just a few months earlier, the readers had considered the column of Valdez to be the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"Before, we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body structure.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they would never have expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it's his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on walkways and buildings.
On that day director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked that she be divided by the government again because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "stricken" of organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco Journalism", he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs but also by police and security forces who were under cover with the organized crime.
Last year, the media watchman group "Articulo 19" has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a dissuasive effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphone were located next to its separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to have been murdered by photographer Ruben Espinosa, who in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of them started to sum up their phones.
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the borderstone edge, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Siren cried in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed his lead.
"How can you remember to close," said Bojorquez, "if the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa the dinosaur".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his cosy skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "unrestful past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him "the best preserved armored dinosaurs that have ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur examples of the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs, who lived in the middle of the creative period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur examples - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with armor and similar to a changing tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better mixing in its surroundings and avoiding its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family has made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sheds and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershadowing, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the counter-shadowing is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borelopelta far exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the countershadowing - think of deer, zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the creative period must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestine content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved supple skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early creative period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just shed a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he's asleep."
The creative period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borelopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six-ton heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borelopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mumified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that stood from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was flooded by western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the animal's skull.
Its right front foot is on its side, its five fingers spread upwards.
I can count the sheds on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, miles long traffic jams - and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured in the late afternoon of a mass carambolage.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen connections (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) nearly 30 vehicles were intertwined during a thunderstorm, including probably trucks.
No data were available on the exact number of injuries at first.
It was mild to moderate injuries, said a police officer.
A great offer to rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich there was a back store of about ten kilometres.
As one AZ reporter reports, there have also been massive barriers on the counterway - through numerous Gaffer.
The fire brigade recorded the vehicle driver's markings, which now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dash.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing suspicious you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you're deep into your work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
Comes the maker and wakes up an unapproached or rips the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the flawless ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer comes, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance trains," said a rail speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket cancellation without creatives.
However, in order to be able to use them, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.
You also have to purchase it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works this way: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will appear for the test customers.
The train attendants are informed on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to Y square when checking the ticket, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket already devalued.
So you can sleep on, work on, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train crew without a ticket check, check in the DB Navigator yourself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often drive the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the biggest nuisances.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets, in any case, but one of your colleagues.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you need to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling your ticket and at the end of the day, the workman takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Who streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, she was born in St. Louis on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was there to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo..
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to them and to their community.
She dropped off her cell phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed, where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a ringing dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer dissuaded his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder that we've used to and that we can call typical."
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying."
She made a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the next morning the two would drive to Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from 11 to 11 years.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and of resistance, which consists of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that she had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state".
"You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be drawn into it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to be freed to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I'd give her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-attack of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurse Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to document or do you try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death contract inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'll be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents of "Whoe Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt as naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Love-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we constantly fight on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main load of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women".
It insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, although she was on the front line, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman is at stake so much.
You can feel your energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on parole for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Draum" to "Größenwahn": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into advocates and opponents since the first 2009 presentation.
Cold doesn't leave the subject one.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While one of them says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes "No man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents build on the fact that a gallery draws more customers into the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be bleeding out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end at the beginning of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - that is to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years we have been buying almost weekly at the Farmermarkthalle.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much.
We have also discovered the butchery for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the rent is up to date.
This is probably not exactly low in the new project."
Eva Killic: "How do shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains for us.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are priced at the top.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Shame, special shops are almost gone, and what's left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery somehow actually comes.
Or is the ghost bit-galerie able to sell all the shops from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - there is no longer any place for senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."
A matching similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost unmistakably similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst paid a 35-year sentence after making secret diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and leading dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he was only in his office for three days.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from manning and from which 30 portraits were created, which could be a person with these genomic data, has created a sharp, though intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the identity.
Manning, born Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was sitting clearly unwell on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blond wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stump and gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became uneven letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Supressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she could see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
At the opening of the exhibition, there is something deep and strong now, since Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, secondary ways to further ignite the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, which was based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a telephone in her hand from the United States' disciplinarians like King-Kong.
"If they put your speech cold, then they won," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it, then in the middle of the room she will be greeted by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, which join together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic halo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
A national manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is being sought out as a suspect after a man was stunned in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea, as the files of the Cook County court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several tricks.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranlea was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Since 2007, Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal case now being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Summerville College, in an e-mail statement, said that "we are in contact with the British police and are willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza's management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the Roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap was updated in this respect," explained Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause Russia concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We carry out the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal of WADA from carrying out doping checks in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be re-established.
Aldi doesn't sell eggs anymore.
This was reported by the groups of companies.
It is a purely precautionary measure that no health impairment could be expected further, as stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-liquids.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness with your employees in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, to address specific groups and demographic groups, to provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases to allow Whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and to contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Erret said that they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which at a glance shows which units have most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can drill why.
Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber involved in Scandale since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $18.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Conversion, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "puls-" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, says Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has been used by Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who directs Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took time for the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and tax companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they have.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only used.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you are doing is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are involved and committed.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take any action.
In fact, when a company asks employees about your feedback, it may be expected that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of this?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, said Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes on 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new exercise fields on campus.
Some have removed their upper tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras did six games in Westwood.
They are scheduled to take 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's change of rule, even if she added another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous load on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed it through, they're going to get on with it, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp has ended, which, in view of the clear lines of its fields, will not be an easy task in the face of an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-level hotel that has already been dropped with football balls that have cleared a safety net behind a peat peat.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far from being brought to think that people are renting a room there and then choosing to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original post, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible misreports and send them to fact-finding auditors who may view results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook said that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing what stories are challenged by third party fact-finders, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages.
Creating a Comic Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In its younger past, the little Scotney Castle was on display in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moppy Yorkshire man with a taste for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' outlines the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lengiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobinians," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were there himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting a little") all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiousities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries digging.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started taking care of the archive he described as "Hund of years in which Aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who owned what: "One could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that fought for the two families.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a commotion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Maybe they're connected to each other?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty Gauners, to make debts and spend money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys, with a talent to promote integration."
After the end of his mission in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with that damn life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle veiled in Rhöndorf
With the housing of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (roundshow of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action since yesterday ask on the posters on the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, which was opened yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that we, as a bad dog citizen, know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature."
Finally, she competes with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and campaign for an average five-digit amount.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the Officers' Corps.
So is this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff's building, as it used to be, but at the head office of the Prime Minister.
The deliberations were also attended by the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Internal Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is attracting the reins in the military.
Head of General Hulsi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Navy have been abandoned.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wiredriver of the coup test.
For 486 people who are to be directly involved in the coup test, negotiations have been held in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overturn "God's gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean completely" the forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "Unease in the Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the removal of the headcloth ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The great cleansing of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 state servants by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual lords of the country.
Three times they drew attention to their role as guardian of the secular state order.
After his 2002 election, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least with reference to the reform of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is actively promoting the Islamicization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" warned an uncalled officer who sought the coup for fear of persecution abroad asylum, that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, it could not leave NATO cold.
Nevertheless, there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansings about the willingness to use the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational skills are "weak", say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US spends green cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for race route shuttle
Over and over the past few months, there has been a dispute over the future of the race route shuttle - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it will be built on the marode track on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the race route shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track will continue this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this particularly important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was around 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalized, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as an operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for 11 years.
This means that the race route shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially among tourists.
In recent months, a pilot company has tested whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also highly constructional in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it.
Just when you thought it couldn't get even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventureable" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best you can," the True Companion website warms.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - quite like real people!
It can be tired, fixed on conversation, or it can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex-robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subversive female qualities, the allusions to rape, when you go a step on Frigid (i.e. here: ardent) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website True Companion Roxxy compared to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their origin and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they still remain temporarily on the verge of consumer culture.
But what goes through the peripheral zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted sexual attack on women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magard's Report') is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robers is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible (although even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a sense of ambiguity of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. election have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Christmas, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s elected relatives.
We're all supposed to stick to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less attention has been paid to the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the appalling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gross possibility that one day his females will no longer repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the Republican of the right wing, which suddenly appear to be an epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.
I find myself nowadays beset by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy one - the dog on the car roof, which was 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - which both in comparison to Trump actually happen to a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify for immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our children to the carousel in the Central Park, the largest of the New York Park carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city are disappointed: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not satisfy the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but rather a large circulation in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s who can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is necessary.
The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital with chest pain from prison
Pistorius left prison for hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, because of the treatment of cuts to his wrists, he was taken to the hospital, which according to the prison authorities, he suffered in his cell after a case.
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to bring this time against Pistorius Appeal's six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National law enforcement authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of his punishment being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to the gym in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday evening, Head of School Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental citizens' house in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle to grow up in the chickenyard, but then released into freedom.
In addition, the mint band performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of it broke down, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's study.
The hens danced with the young goggles that wore cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other chicks, it belongs to it.
He'll never be like a chicken.
His destiny was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
The following words of thanks followed to the colleagues, former head of school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into school bottlenecks, and the parents.
The chick time was now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of schooling, she was very reluctant because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the fourth graders.
At the end of the year, all students made a song of summer time and holiday season sound.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first graders are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, reported.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal civilians was arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the stakeholders need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and, in part, Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) has ordered its retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has notified each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within that framework.
How long should the overall changeover take place?
"Heavy to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on manufacturer's commitment and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily in the field of environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers are thought to be tracking.
Is there a risk of a massive price decline of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But especially in the regions where driving bans threaten.
There are no losses in value for older diesel in rural areas.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
This year, as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the ceremony.
The prizewinner Lear, known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to withdraw the funds from them - and this is bothering me".
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The post is already registered - however, suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he communicates in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city will be looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time.
Thus, while respecting the regular termination periods, there should still be enough time for an entry.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide the relevant diplomas.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But closer to citizens, the city and itself are important, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate as well as a good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worth living", he is sure about the Bauamt and its employees.
In the future, however, varied projects are also on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have started.
The Kinzig bridge between Bolenbach and Steinach is being renewed, the stadium renovation is still the subject.
The latter alone will make a bet with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," says Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
It is designed for a city builder to have a large room for play.
Haslach's own construction yard and gardening could be used to react to a lot of things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of green spaces is often mentioned praiseably by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the separating city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything goes over my table."
With care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Deepbau) has been in the process for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the place and stay".
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should have a degree in architecture as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor and have good knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction law.
The City Building Office is subject to civil and civil engineering, construction management, land acquisition, urban property management, municipal farm with construction yard and municipal garden and Lower Construction Law Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South Railway locked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators come from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
A rosarot scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed near the scene of the crime.
"This goes far beyond a lausbo stroke," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA.
He or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put the train at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement could also be the penalty of the railway customers.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be assumed.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway could be managed without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning, two of them concerned long-distance transport.
However, freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloatings, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those concerned are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance-enhancing immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophans had mice in their food, the more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that fostered tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was, however, housed separately, did not have that.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the gastric tract.
The thumbs of the mice were sequenced with DNA and six species of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in the mice.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-milchic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feeding of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastric tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the internal surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched for pleasure.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three new obligations, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of his four priority new obligations.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put a lot of effort into it."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, United States, and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New low impact for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns out: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked at Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Only no fire from the centre of the party, no counterwind from the League - this was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with increasing horror the events in the SPD-regulated state capitals.
What Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
They were deep.
One by one.
The Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot reliably govern," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising faction of a Green Member's resignation has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
The Green-Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Green Member Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The violation of CDU means a clear distortion of voter will.
Every Twesten has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"It must not be true at all," sighs a SPD campaigner, when the new Job Message reaches the party's headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is present after the transition of the Green Deputies Elke Twesten to CDU without a majority of government.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The miser began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the comrades at the time.
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That's what got it - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a standstill, the Düsseldorf-Pleite struck the party down smoothly.
The comrades got up in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD countryman, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication, he made almost everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
My survey results were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of that, Because in the past weeks has been trying increasingly to put accents in the covenant.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden by comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted because they promised to stabilise the party by reason of Weil.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Weil is basically not to blame for the internal conflict of the Low Saxon Greens.
And Schulz didn't.
In the meantime, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and harmful to democracy how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD-Bundestagsfraction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the national list of the Low Saxon Greens, the Dutch Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electorate's will four years ago was clear: People have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate for the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the outcome of the election," continued Oppermann.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for district core III
If you want to renovate your house, you can get support from the country in the near future.
About this, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development were informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of the events so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in Rehabilitation I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the Rehabilitation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the current renovations are a "success" project - it is important to promote internal development as well as to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, one received the information from the Karlsruhe government presidium that there will be a Rehabilitation Area III.
The funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros will be from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a rehabilitation area come about?
According to Schindler, one will continue to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in rehabilitating whether there is any interest in the planned area.
Where appropriate, the territorial borders could then shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the "Social City" federal government programme, in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in terms of objects, i.e. per plot.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The authorisation period for the funding will be until 30 April 2026 from 1 January 2017.
By September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out only once, in the context of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the decision on the Statute will be taken in order to start the renovations in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about evaluating the urban misunderstandings and deciding when to reorganise and to what extent.
It is then also entered in the land register for the respective property a rehabilitation note.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties involved.
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent postally to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property sheet", which concerns, among other things, the structural condition and the recovery plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "housekeeping and housing sheet", information on size, distribution and residents of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operator's bill" shall only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
Furthermore, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasteful" to those present.
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come in with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his doorway, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and index fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory Anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production in the last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's claims to the TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House executive officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin firearm and a Mississippi forklifter.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17th, around 7am for the event at 3pm, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of hours of service.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety staff of the unit stayed on the plane during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was needed in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," replied the Deputy Commander.
The event "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President urged the reform of the health reform, which was under way in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government legislation.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when, in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, the President aircraft provided taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Deputy Press Secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to stop the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was included in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are well below this rate.
"Determining the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the DoD refund rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press officer, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It wasn't clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firearm car.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of tricky task
The second tennis Bundesliga is the top rider in the table three Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take part in the table three Searchsdorfer SV tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel.
Despite the fact that after five games the top rider of the Second Tennis League has still got the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are particularly important.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to deployments in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Oles, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It'll be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the French currently active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first engagement in this season.
The so far unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday with the Weißrussen Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagrina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also go back to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coach staff around Marius Zay will fill up the cadre.
How America Can Harm OMV
Really happy Donald Trump did not work when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In his having to pass the law," the Congress had packed a few "unconstitutional regulations", he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shuddered against the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, who together with other European companies co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2.
The threat scene is enormous.
Nevertheless, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Carter in Netflix's hit series will be brought to the centre
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobars Killer reveals, the series of Netflix is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evils of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, inviting the guy, American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Rolling backward: The city has 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the day-to-day urbans.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
This is a good news for Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Youth Assistance Department: "We were all very pleased".
Bought is still out of the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooled.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kita year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need grows steadily.
"At times, not only children who are cared for for for for 45 hours of the week will eat in the kita for lunch," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 14:00."
46 part-time staff have from 1 September kitchen service: they warm up the food supplied, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give the food, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hour range.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the kita management."
It is also about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team would be useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self-directing and foreign awarding for the city, it is said from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being re-set.
"But these hours do not fall so much into the weight of around 750 people in the education field," Sonja Pommeranz says.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections to the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats to an election process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be peacefully passed on from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the 13-year-olds who had stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße spoke to them about 14.55 a.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old, however, refused the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this was a mistake.
Without looting, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McViie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to check with managers of the Biscuit manufacturer McViie about the long-term obligation to produce at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces next to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB called on Scotland McVitie's to "think that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be driven forward".
GMB-Senior-organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the labour force focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow region, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantages.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokesperson from Pladis said: "The head of the Tollcross branch only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will react directly to it because we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and unsafe economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operating improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago before Neymar?
La Liga's page may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be abandoned in her persecution of Neymar after making an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and is the world’s highest-paid professional sports player. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 a week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board of Directors insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President about this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller thrown and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter placed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus did damage to the vehicle's covering of over 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for information.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came across him on his driving track, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and strut the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the road at around 19.55 at the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, a passenger car came across his lane so that he had to avoid to the right.
The Touran driver also played the guideboard.
The passenger car was damaged.
The passenger of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Cathedral Patzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Patten continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weinder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected an excuse from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed deep regret over their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that in reporting on violence in the cathedrals there are "two-measured" measured.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is "abominable and shameful act" that needs to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and that's a found food."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were a normal pedagogical means," "to get done with naughty children like me."
They found it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the volume of memory "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he reviews the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was appointed by the Bishop of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of attacks were used in a total of 547Regsburger Domspatzen, 67 domspatzen sexually abused.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be observed that in many cases, the Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially in the event of high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused people, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even with violence, combine positive memories with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Father Georg Ratzinger, in his opinion, relieves.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "events of violence against the patrons of the Regensburg Cathedral Patten" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choler and perfectionist, who often became hand-in-hand when a domspatz did not offer a top performance musically.
How do you rate this final report as his biologist?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted by every suspicion of fellow-privilegedness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Excesses of violence at the preschool were also taking place outside his sphere of influence.
It can at any rate be blamed on him to experience it too late or not to take first indications seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also present an excellent witness, describing him as "warm hearty", "popular", "righteous", "competent" and "understanding", as extremely kind teachers, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candys and "was always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also led to angry outbreaks.
Not only did he knock with chairs and throw the keyring to the ground, but he also spread ear figs and pulled all too naughty guys on his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologizes for it.
It must be said, however, that in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, such methods of education were widespread among parents and teachers.
Do you still know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what this report actually deals with, namely, the terrible sexual abuse and the excretion of violence at preschool, these are, of course, bagatelles.
They are already wondering if it is not more related to his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just come upon him.
Many who have never understood him still work hard at the Bavarian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a great deal has been reported on the subject of abuse in the town of Regensburg.
Is Georg Ratzinger also burdened with any development or co-operation in relation to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the master of the cathedral.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of the affected vice-presidents to the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in the investigation of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How, then, domspatzen-Schüler evaluate the role of Ratzinger in terms of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question formulated it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it ... also is really absurd to assume that it is just him ... boys have opened up more intrusive or clearer or even more, than to their parents, boarding directors, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is acquitted from any fellow-consul.
Neither can he be accused of not preventing or displaying him.
That is why there is no reason to link his good name with these ominous crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media much of "violence" was to be read at the Regensburg Cathedrals.
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedrals, between sexual abuse and excretion, as well as, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time of 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the cathedrals.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were seriously harassed and painted by sadistic teachers, and suffered horribly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous states must have ruled.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he didn't see the boys until they were already on the domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most witnesses stress, the topic "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to escape from her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" states.
What was the other thing on the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even link positive memories with him despite violence".
At most, the charge remains to have looked away.
Despite all efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods of time in which it was reported to him by the states at preschool.
The first time he started to establish himself in 1970/71, he wanted to hear nothing (so the witness) and then again around 1993 from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears in front of the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out that "in pre-school the penalty continues to be practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when punishments were long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey zone, as each of us still knows.
It was difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the allowed limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not right.
It was not until 1980 that the penalty on schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to those of the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "iftrick des Anachronisms", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, nor to what was broken in the preschool of contradictions and violence to innocent child souls, that goes far beyond what was then common.
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally being opened up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. ear figs and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Was the subject of punishment for beatings also mentioned?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the cathedral patches played only one side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the previously known nationally renown Regensburg cathedrals, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, one does not make a big singer out of rebellious boys and stand before every success, regardless of the field, yet always discipline, passion and self-surpassing.
As what kind of a person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and hearty people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something to one fly.
I get regular contact with him, visit him, read him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family, 23 years after his retirement.
So those who until today do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedrals are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a kind respectable person to which they still look up today and whom they worship.
And please, again quite clearly: all that is being accused of him are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is most unfair to turn a man into a medial scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
There is only too obvious the evil intention behind it.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the proponent would command a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany's probably no one would know the Regensburg cathedrals finally in peace.
