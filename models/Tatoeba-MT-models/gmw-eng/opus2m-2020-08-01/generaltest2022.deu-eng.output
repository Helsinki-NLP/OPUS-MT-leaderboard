The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# wholesale and so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I think that's very annoyed.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
I also believe that children should not be allowed to play a role for their little siblings.
However, I also think it is good to take care of the little ones in measure.
Take a look, help for a second, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can be enough child, I can't see a problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's OK for him, it's good.
You can best decide for yourself if that's suitable for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while asleep.
It's probably legally questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something actually happened like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, taking care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole act, however, the title partout doesn't want me to remember anymore perhaps someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by overwhelming with food and going to his predators.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats scared patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously assigned before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and place the photos on the internet.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist operates some kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses the brain's fear center and finally puts the patient's fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides with intention to die)
This fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can reveal the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password available for the Wlan.
Must contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to return the price difference ?
Child, 4 J., Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has wood splinters under the thumb nail over the entire length (outside).
I tried to pull him with a pintette.
Very hard to grab.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow's to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotives of the trace widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker along with sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders log in automatically to a suitable digital centre.
It masters all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with suitable power stations.
For centres that can only program the CVs of 1-255 there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx® compatible power stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with equal tension is also possible.
In addition, he also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendulum automatic pendulum allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC currents.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance fresh vaccination
Always new Omikron cases provide politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the corona boost vaccinations due to the rapid rise in omicron numbers than previously sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, on Sunday evening Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The British Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Faced with the omicron variant, there is an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be increased urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let's get angry now," said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, thus increasing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent.
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price in case of collection?
I'm in favour of all imagining themselves with pronouns
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googleed him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner, and I don't want to keep any officials on my feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine himself with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today can't.
Obviously, the chair had an unmistakable lack of sale.
How can such a upholstery occur after 9 months?
Only tried on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since ca.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but I wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I am going to write a little more detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I (21) come more often into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
A topic that really nods to me and unfortunately is far too common is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
I am quite clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing I cannot reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's a fear to leave the usual social environment in fear of revenge, fear of leaving the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly even very close to tears, it is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this will never make it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so inconceivable.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the series about "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg near the Merlins Crailsheim
At least at Youngster Johannes Patrick was left.
Nothing again: for the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the game Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the Cup low at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in the belly".
However, it did not lie down after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) - low in the basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result disappointed the way in which it appeared.
The three-Quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young John Patrick) said and wrote 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer provided John Patrick: "After the victory at Tenerife, we simply weren't focused enough, and didn't implement what we trained".
To move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim replied: "A cool game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena, but they were at their expense.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and guided the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to fight doesn't remain.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore re- filed them.
We originally reported a half year ago.
Always spelled out like from the egg: Max Rabe is 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't do anything.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to control the Corona virus.
Other of his appearances planned during the Advent season must first fail, as it is called on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January on, the artists will then want to recapture their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and a lot as a youth.
In Berlin he studied operal singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the Baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his success album "For Women this is no problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair strictly combed back and thought on labels, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020.

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created due to expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, there is no new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of private owners, cooperatives or housing companies, for example, is the best protection against monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party intends to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the People's decision.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition about further tightenings in the rental law.
The Coalition Agreement provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in strained housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement it as soon as possible.
If the rent market is still not relaxed, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous Tornados have moved through the United States.
Only in Kentucky could more than 100 deaths be complained.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several Tornadon heavy devastations in the U.S. have caused up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a approximately 320 km long snow of devastation, especially in the Member State of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Besher said that everything was gone after a visit to the disaster zone, wherever the Tornado was in a hurry.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He calculates alone in Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw she sold out display #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it entirely removed from the range?
Is there the possibility to order this display in another country?

I understand, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or given a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was coming or being processed, since I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccines and change advertising terms
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company he's been blaming about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not stick to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the greetings!
I am currently leading the adventure for a group of 4 friends about the grip pass and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arch is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual files invented and now I am writing the entry adventure and already stumble at the first envelope over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a carriage with grain of Gratenfels to a small village near the Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action is to develop.
Some miles away from the village, a group of Goblins is to beckon the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I would like to give players the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, identifying the danger at an early stage, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with arches and sabers
When the Goblins do not notice, the heroes lie up in a hollow road and flank to the left and right of each three arches armed the fleet, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all found and healed unconsciously and thereafter by the son of the village school, a half-fifth.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-fifth will intervene with two of his servants and will come to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart's still there, it's all great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as a start to adventure?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I am guaranteed many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back.
If you can then let the backlights come, I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hi dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get a little breath with this post.
First of all, in the middle of the F2 race today, the transfer was stopped to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident of the schedule was far behind planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 is a priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially as Sky UK has transferred the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Schwarzyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was a regular ignorance in the F1 with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag you can change the tires.
Although this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone already existed this year, both of them only came to the conclusion that steps may change the tires when there were corresponding radio statements to Hamilton on this subject.
At Sky UK as well as RTL both commentators knew immediately that there is this possibility for progress.
I believe that such elementary rules should be known simply by commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
Nor is it the first level of mystery, which is now possible or required by rules, both of them simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally, with the cut-back comment style of Roos does not like, but admit that the taste is.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant ambiguities, both of which simply leave an unprofessional effect, such as ordering coffee from (unsuspectingly) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in fact, brings a lot of unrest into the comment he does not seem to take seriously.
Last but not least, advertising simply takes over with Sky, in the runout round, Sky is the only station that goes into the advertising, how to listen to F1TV because only the German sound track has to come out without a comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two channels in the trainings make less advertising than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although it is necessary to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job with the four races they can still transfer, except for advertising.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect in a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Ventilation pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 versions by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services compared.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with them.
Having a large aquarium is suitable for pumps with 2 or more outlets, so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series also has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, or something like that.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus ensures low operating noise.
Installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected 4/6 mm to an austreamer, etc....and it can already go away.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and be fitted outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a impact valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if water were to run backwards, running through the pump from the basin...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the 3 day processing time here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are collected here every day.
Walking on the road all right, it's very fast.
We just want to avoid a little bit so that no one is voted just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone understands the whole staff who also work in the forwarding industry...of course here does not stop Corona.
Please do not evaluate as badly as the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to talk about these services, even if we say right now that... they're fucking heavy.
This is also very different regionally.
Be no one evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take the yellow to order with and without armrests?
Can you also order your legs in bright?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four more passengers made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard missile system of Blue Origin from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the about ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezos received the freshly-chosen astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the Nasa astronaut, who was flown into space in 1961, was named Blue Origin's rocket system (1923-1998), and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who had paid four other passengers for their tickets: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not report.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his bets and do everything himself.
She just flew along like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would prefer to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" missile system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness before the reusable object returned to the ground from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometres above earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy boss of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics charge Bezos and Blue Origin with largely promoting business with space tourism without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also in the laboratory I am not disturbed (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also thought before studying the subject of professional prospects at the time I decided to study and become a graduate.
At the moment, however, I am in doubt, especially depressing my professional prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you hear super career opportunities over and over again and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand you hear again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) What are you working for now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and I'm thinking 2022 might be going to drop my studies and make a training as a specialist computerist.
If you have experience there, you also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now that there's a post.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there are also those before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week, the Assumption of Mary was called "Ascent" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails that have to be out of front of the driveway, order here, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and can't be that?
Or because people want to do all the serious things in a shortened week as much as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully energized.
What's this self-satisfaction about holidays?
What do we have holidays for if we are not allowed to treat them properly?!
The stress probably did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite self-evidently so on it.
My question is simple: are we just like this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north, too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in its Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree on the feast by baking and basking with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But she still has a lot to do until the day of reflection: "For the first time I don't have any gifts, I have to start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of mouse and plumage renewal.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the damage to the feathers in the bird’s rearing is solely due to nutritional defects.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is essential for the formation of an impeccable spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are based on poor or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most vegetable feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or via soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it
Unfortunately still not functioning
DDR-Handwerksmodel Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Schleswig and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably stems from the remodelling proposal of the model railwayer ME Heft 11/1968, used with tracks and misaligned parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the tractor of heavy coal-carrying trains in the Scottish network, possibly the kit also comes from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally prepared
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG determined the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tact camp drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and subsequently found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a repair property.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The workability of all six locomotives was noted in the Dessau Reichsbahn improvement plant.
[4] As a result of the progressive re-electrification of the medium German network, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight trains, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 existing in larger quantities were preferred.
Only when the E 94 saw no further increase in the number of jobs could the E 95 reach the point of the reprocessing.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the station Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own orbital plan mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complex control of locomotives proved to be difficult.
Thus, it was more common that shooters would stick to switch operations.
Then the concubine on this locomotive with hammer and wooden cable had to release the shooter again during the ride.
Damages to the motors were more frequent and resulted in months-long failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new building locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to abandon old locomotives and most of the splitter holes, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one more time, which would have led to a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's position.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid 1969, they were the last to follow the E 95 01, which was granted the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has never been used.
All locomotives were broken down until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future E 77 10 museum locomotive as a soft heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 as a museum locomotive was worthy.
In 1979 the first external work of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it to a car show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is cared for.
Since 1995 employees of the traditional group Bw Halle P have been working on the operational work of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time as an exhibition at Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external painting, with the transformers being checked and five motors being operational.
- The locomotives were in use on the Schlesian mountain railway and the branching side lines until 1945, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig as a medium German network.
The main area of application was first of all the country of Sicily.
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary to rework the locomotive in its own work, dusted, with playing tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small-series company ZSCHSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can show labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The central beam is kept by two feet.. sufferer these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is kept by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I'll get new ones.
When will they be sent away?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right form of the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing they do is meet their purpose.
They're not flat on me.
Could I get these?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two slightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has arisen in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reported to have been hospitalized on Sunday with slight smoke poisonings.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume intentional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the further investigations.
But it's coming a lot later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs.
To discourage fake news - Biontech-CEO releases vaccination photo
Uğur Łahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech chief Uğur Łahin had so far not publicly expressed himself on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to tell him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Łahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the corona virus.
In the social media there was misinformation that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Oahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For several months friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging from a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, often fuelled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can only be difficult to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Oahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video arose in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle himself explained.
"I am currently not permitted by law to get the vaccine myself," said Iahin at the time.
There was a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritisation has long been lifted - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in Nordrhein-Westfalen the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralysed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in Nordrhein-Westfalen had to get out without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 people were hit by fire in several municipalities.
The provider Westnet reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units were in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firemen and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered shelters in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the interested parties for their patience and for their help.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Division in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take place for a few days, as the Western network technicians were initially able to put some lines back into operation only provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company data.
Flow flow back
The fire broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m., according to Westnet in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt switch station.
There would be a need for extensive cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is standing again.
Since Saturday 18h, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually moved from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m. also had the electricity that was most recently affected by the failure.
Over 80 manufacturers of Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens care about older or single people in their neighborhood and report to local fire station houses when assistance is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power units, the main focus was on the inhabitants of Altenheimen.
Moreover, according to authorities, temporary care places in schools have been set up for those people who have not been able to take care of themselves or who need the power-dependent medical equipment or depend on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
This is the day's ceiling #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount that base on the table top.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of that.
We wanted those with tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them together and thus shorten them.
Can you help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back because otherwise she is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased to receive a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Let's do it like that!
Do you send me the return receipt by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG# prior to purchase.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost insolent.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riber wins
The German Nordic combinationrs Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are sprinted at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
Once again, the duo had to give itself to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riber, who had already started the race with great advantage after ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made new and use version 4.5...
could have been that they have heard of problems more often
Got directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty to report to customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can she help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To make the color order even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly close to stroke.
Easily overlap the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quickly wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark might shine later.
Metal tones and metallic colours end up with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it may come to unsightly metal-screpers when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models reach the original true appearance through the decals or decals.
From sovereign signs on airplanes to ship names to germinations and markings for car models: The Decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components can still be reached well.
An aircraft cockpit can be bonded easily or easily before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as shaving, pins and toothpicks are in sticking time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each decal needed individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slide images, because you wet their backs with water briefly until the carrier paper gets dark through the wets.
Then you just move the picture a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding position on the model (which you also wet before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper off sideways.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is right before you push it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, kneeling or even tearing.
Soak off excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log on and reload the book and look for the place until where I have read it.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in three single packages with me.
OK, thank you very much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get it back without problems?
Child request treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We have been in childish desire treatment for some time now when it comes to accounting with the PKV, it suddenly takes place across.
The series after:
We had requested the children's wishes in advance at the PKV and got the promise about 3 attempts.
The tests were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was charged with PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (successless) attempts, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again requested the acquisition of the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After some further attempts (we have done more tests than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to repay 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the General Terms and Conditions "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment need no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have to point out in the commitments that at one birth the further attempts are taking place?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed ovaries) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how best to reach them again
All right.
We won't order anything with them.
When they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They're welcome to pass this on to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was prompted and now tell me that I have to send this thing back.
I don't think I can do anything to make me feel completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the repayment was made and I still have not received any repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair shall not be used normally.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
No matter what, the warranty of 24 months is valid.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I'm going to cut the closet down and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
Applying these products with additional stools we can unfortunately not find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no foundation from a major film studio or private investor.
In the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give up soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
Half victory against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to policy expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not continue to resolve the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Science and Policy Foundation (SWP).
This floating state - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
The relationship with people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there was an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to be able to prevail when a Member State comes to the head to do its thing", like current Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
Furthermore, the EU pays a further price for its border policy with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle on asylum policy will be difficult, as the line on border protection, border protection and border protection has been strengthened.
New attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have now once again tried to reach Belarus on Polish territory.
55 migrants had been arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
In the event of the incident, the Polish officials had been thrown by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be provided medically by a military doctor.
A total of 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of having attracted her to Minsk with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reported that there were border sections in the press.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has put its market power in the balance sheet and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also had to take domestic policy costs into account.
Belarus's society would probably not be determined that the security device would regularly lock thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finals
In the view of Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have committed two regular breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an opposition.
The silver arrows assume two regular breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safe-car phase when he is supposed to have been illegally overtaken.
A second opposition was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
After Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had been overtaken by Lewis Hamilton on the last lap in Mercedes and had finished his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken driving cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
Thank you for the support

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
In the context of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord" author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her doorstep.
I left the contact form yesterday to return an article, but I did not receive an e-mail confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your knocked chat and falsely delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix, and not all of us from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# night table and a return label.

But just because he says he's not an antisemit means nothing.
That's like when an abdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
It will not be yours to admit it.
But Colleague constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to dissociate, you should just leave it complete.
Yeah, well, then you're just as serious as Colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
For my sakes, a God has brought the whole thing into motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science only softens nonsense.
And with that, you're a science enemy and no more serious to take like Colleague
In order to maintain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specifically aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying and colour flawless glass to the edge zone.
Often, lumbars are marked with magnifications.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to make optimal use of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see the instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even in the case of impact loops.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflex coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations in the sale of pines.
Once, even without his partner, a man should have returned home because both could not agree.
Every year he plants well 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
It always makes fun of the pre-Christmas, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I am gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate that accordingly!
We do not need to have any discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And therefore both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher", which by far doesn't sound as delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems to build a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbits up to a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which broadcasts the wifi, no longer arrives at the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes (i.e. use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. from the other module).
This leads to the Internet with the new fiber optic connection now on the first floor even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar major losses.
Could anyone explain to me why glass fiber is "losing" so much internet speed over the power line?
And is LAN really the one solution?
It would be extremely difficult to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really despairing, so I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
If you had thought that the girocons would have been quiet for the first time, you'd be fooled.
While many banks have used autumn to confirm the increases in fees of the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the amount of allowances for negative interest continues to decline.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the amount of free money and even quartered for the day money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only to customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros at Giro and Investment accounts and to 25 0.000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still in force, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the amount of free money to two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an amount of EUR 25,000 or less according to Verivox Internet portal figures.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: However, there is still a legal discussion with the consumer centres, which in the first instance have even been entitled to this regulation before the Landgericht Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions should perhaps make provision - in case the upper authorities also have to declare negative interest rates inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made 2021 with the "Friends" reunity and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they give themselves a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
The fact that you fly the hearts of the female and male fans alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just wrong with luck - and she's still looking for great love.
And the baby wish removed from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she became a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Stays hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and wiped the sweat off the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight band touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsports-king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the 2007 World Championship win in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came to the stage 103 times. dpa
Friedrich fetchs 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I figured this out, I had to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it until Cortina 2026," said the double-Olympiasier from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg race.
Only on Saturday did he resist the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something to the material setting and went out a bigger advantage on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he stood in front of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier became third.
"We took greater risks today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to the fifth place this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer of the FC Bad Feilnbach landed four in the first race at number eight.
"If I knew what he'd do differently, I'd do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third victory in the two-way.
After it was only enough for fourth place in Monobob the day before, she raced for World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with Anschieberin Deborah Levi.
Two-Bob-Olympia winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first Podestplatz in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first place in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were okay today," said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not just a move, but there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was annoyed a little about the not completely flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't redeem why I finally asked for it.
Through Corona I had quite different problems last year and never time for it.
And now it's said he's gone that's really annoyed me.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order again, as it is currently reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the falsely delivered would.
But we would like the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged

Just this day, just this week, just till XY...
Hi dear great girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write, and maybe it's one thing or another...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - apart from my dog not yelling or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken a burn 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also had emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we have chosen a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him take a shower (because hand is in the association wg burning).
In addition, he is cooled and we currently see less (1-2x week) what makes me very much with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just got a stomach hurt, I cooked for him, and now he's in his cuddle and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is still homework on us, which of course we divide.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is quite well adjusted, I'm half well treated and well done.
Not well, but I'm getting right and I'm almost symptomatic.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should prepare at least a little.
And next week I'll have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what's coming in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then weekend is.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Just to the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just till weekend.
Just till...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental clues because otherwise I'll pack that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you are?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't put that into words at all.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that has a lot to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find pleasures here...
I certainly wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have received my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two times, then.
But she was not confirmed.
Sometimes something completely different: I found in school at that time that many religious teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christianly and I always believed in something like this.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What then leads you to want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope you're asking isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write in English that I also understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd give up.
It's okay, thanks.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello, dear people.
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
For one thing, modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it in any way in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself I mean.
I think the transition is also the soldier's graveyard.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that tells you something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept only on the belly from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child is far more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around, not cuddly animals, going in and watching more often, but not a minute's surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it's asleep.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it get up from the stomach?
Or is it with the face forward directly in the mattress?
That's what you can derive from whether everything's okay.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband came to the world, it was going to be, like, going and putting the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stampkunde" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the closet.
I would like to contact you as soon as possible.
The cabinet cannot be used at the moment.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this station is now under all the seeds.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big bedding tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" internet transmitter.
Quote Arno: One wants to be "no running Litfass Column".
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
They apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A crogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How do you think all this is good?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I'm asking for a back call, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defectively.
Body break through damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in abdominal pain or just for cuddling – My little heat friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherish core cushions are a traditional home for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and re-dispensate again.
The removable inside cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if they don't feel well.
The cherry core cushion with reference is suitable only for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for non-typical smell, stock or fire spots and immediately dispose of them if available.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating from the cover before!
Heat up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (notes of the microwave manufacturer!)
After heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion in the cover.
In the first heatings, light moisture formation may occur at the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Follow the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for fitness for babies (max. 43 °C) at your armpit!
Do not use pillows in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, blood bruising and open wounds, and in people with reduced pain.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disease and pregnancy, please contact a doctor prior to use.
If sewing has opened and loose cores leave, remove the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents associated with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so I still need to work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Wrong display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plug-in power supply.
As a result, I expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here either.
You guys have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment with it?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series will present itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack, yet provide quick access to the photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally over the lid valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already been proven by the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal clasp hook in the clasp with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has created different "filling positions" in this respect: there are 4 anchor beams, stablely destroyed, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
Clasp closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second possibility is also fundamentally different from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid valve, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wander through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the daily fitness of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In everyday backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more down below) and thus store both of them separately – and access them independently through the two lateral openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the main right corner, while the everyday things stay safely in the left backpack half and do not come in between.
Comfortable, easy-to-use straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also entirely made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email of her support.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I'll give you a bigger order, but anyway, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send it back.
And that the past year was different from what I thought I couldn't know and I just couldn't solve it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, who appreciate reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (bore and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are suitable for certain discs and samples.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created which is aimed at the characteristics of the original assembly with the balance of the disc.
The well-made discs thus ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake gap.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered lightly broking in the water at the southern end of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the country's fastest growing and flourishing cities.
Areas were set up, tents opened, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrupt)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, driving horses together, and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to exceed your pioneer colleagues to avoid going with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You select your actions simultaneously, you need to budget your resources and build a tableau which is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual style of play with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California acquired official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it will get a lock!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players carry out alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The prizer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the prizer has moved five times, thus covering every location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from a robbery of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolving lights and the bandits are superior in numbers, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is made.
The player with the most winning points wins!

The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a violent educational debate.
Former patient: Whether or not there are serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never, be our parents and other responsible ones, about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the framework for the child as big as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brother, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the removal of the test requirement for triple vaccinations
At its next meeting, the Ministers for Health of the countries want to decide on a national removal of the test requirement for triple vaccinations.
"We countries quickly need clarity as to whether and when, for three times the vaccinations, the test requirement can be omitted," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The withdrawal of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional impant appeal," said Holechek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on this subject on Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back.
How am I doing best?

Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page at the computer goes.
I've updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe as *Awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under complete anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most common thing is to hear sounds/voices, more rarely to see pictures and most rarely to see pain.
Important for this topic: Kaiser cuts are operations associated with an increased rate of Awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia for the protection of the child until the aberration.
Prior episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during anaesthesia examination.
Certain anaesthesia methods such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment by me does describe Awareness correctly, however had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Have read her comment incorrectly.
But the chair is broken.
The 20€ unfortunately don't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if at least they take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair in private.
We're losing a lot of money, too.
I already sent you an email that you did not answer.
Again the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they deliver only in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I need to cancel the order, since I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I won't call you?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older."
The shaking diarium of a slow farewell to the world, led by the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I've been witnessing my thanks for life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wood pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
You are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year is not collected
New York for the first time win MLS Championship

Rouding Tips & Tricks
I had here a week ago many great tips for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I've come to taste and want to cook New Year's Eve Roulade for the first time.
Tomorrow, I'll set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I'll get it.
IEs is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18 January that the refund was effected.
But to this day the money has not entered my home.
Would you please check there?
Where there are still Christmas breads in the Lübeck room
For many people goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten a poultry yet?
Now it's about time.
We'll tell you where you get another Christmas bread in the Lübeck room.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level and the cutting content of your sounds on the one hand.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and the distortion.
Further above, it sounded that even a power reserve can be made available with the POWER LEVEL controller if it goes loud.
The entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when you use a headphone or direct recordings, you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voting device.
If you donate a VFS5 foot switch in addition, you can also easily access the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effects blocks, and "tapping" the speed of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX will take another step into the future!
But had this been the case with others.
Is there any way to send the lamp back to you?
Since she hangs too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the comedian?
Do we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If I can't, I'd be happy with a deposit or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need will then be a little bit.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were planned as part of the delivery.
I would like to install the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worthwhile
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the revitalisation of the International Atomic Energy Agreement are progressing according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics to be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first there was no agreement on the issues to be discussed.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalisation of the agreement continued after almost a week's interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on-site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence throughout Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was located at the Corona incidence on Sunday over the 1000 mark.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence throughout Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence had fallen slightly in Thüringen, but had also been above the value of 1000.
Within one day, 2242 new infections with the Sars-Cov-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported in Thuringia.
200 patients with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overburdened for weeks and hardly come after with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick to the package and place it at the post office, was it?
I don't have to click/date/complete anything here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, 8 euro return fee is a naughtiness.
It's time for change
###MBundestag are greet me, I am in the plenary room in the heart of Europe in a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not existent.
We came into a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it like?
For the most part, this is simply related to dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression has increasingly been that many here really still have Bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked which wants to keep it alive.
The incitement came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found one, simply said, of shards.
After some writing down and down, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we appear abroad in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a lot, but that's not bad, and we've got the discord in the end.
If you have pleasure and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp screen from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/kloppy for this and is not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day-cover #PRS_ORG#, is there also the oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up soon.
And I'm asking you to let that happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, probably also rarely eats meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal torture.
That is why I decided to become a vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was disheartened, then she defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh was coming from and one could be reduced as vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly put in a corner as a Vegan and that conflicts arise without putting it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception in accordance with § 312d BGB.
Do not remove your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am not on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my returns on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, it can't be changed either.
Can I have an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45.000 euros grant from the country
Recently, Rheinland-Pälzische Innenminister Roger Lebenntz presented a grant notice of EUR 45,000 for the new aircraft car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle car is used by the diver season Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you can count on increasing efforts: the boom of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations have synchronized, removed, and the app does NOT have worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you first for standing up for the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also weapons bearers in the executive, I don't want to go into that!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the State servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, in the special uniform and weaponry of weapons, people should also be magically attracted to the right of conservatives, and it should be clear to everyone that, of course, these people are difficult to deal with the living reality, because, of course, you have a lot of Germans with migration backgrounds, women and homosexuals (and thus I do not mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less to not at all but quite normal men and women whom you do not notice if they do not tell you) and also to these people and I have to rely on them, because in doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But even these marginal groups represent themselves even if it sounds strange for me to have a conservative attitude, speak proudly of Germany and feel less caught up by excessive leftist politics, even if this policy seems to be working for it or if it means to make them right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, because of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-hazarding plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that police and soldiers who have often been engaged abroad often start to standardize because of negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certainly even right-wing colleagues meet who have a strong exchange of views.
Nevertheless, what I think is well combated, and also with political education and education is countered to the whole!
Germany is so much ensnared internationally and this is also quite so my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the wood are two deep candles filled with some yellow
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Orphaned by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been working a thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am independent, very little free time), but for my life I have been getting it more badly than right to keep my household permanently clean and clean.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean.
But it is never so "that anyone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not better, but it bothers me somewhere, but most of the time household simply loses against work and unhappiness.
The kitchen is still cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get better with child?
We don't have anything yet to do with it, and this question has been taking me longer.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as long as no visit comes and e.g. always there is fresh clothing and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with child or do you stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the area of software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I am increasingly aware that this profession is not the right thing for me, which is why I have been thinking for some time now about starting a new job and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (EPPS).
That means that I have no self-esteem and am so shy.
I have no problem talking to people on an objective level, but it is very difficult for me to have easy conversations and I have been told more often that I am not working (which I think has already been better).
Can I become such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, the search advice or family assistance.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really the way I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The EPPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to object to my code ("if again simplest things cracked") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know for myself how this is going"/"I think it's with my stupid questions from work"/"he really has to think me less mediated" etc.).
I'm probably going to have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it on the spot.
But you got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for collection
What do they mean, give back, please!
When I have downloaded a book to #PRS_ORG#, the message does not authorize your #PRS_ORG#
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed disintegrates the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastro-intestinal tract and builds out of them its own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of the feathers.
The plumage formation in the nestling and the plumage formation in the musculoskeletal bird are extremely complex and the animal's overall organism is particularly demanding.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding cycle.
Following this rapid administration of NEKTON-Bio, a return to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be made.

1 g NEKTON-Bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/weed food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A brushed spoon (inline) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON can be given at the beginning until the approach of re-formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the re-formation of the plumage is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologise, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair go broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hi, I sent an e-mail on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement of a municipal employee in opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be found on our property.
So filed a case for the community.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also walnut is not part of the statutes.
However, in the statutes walnut is explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I need to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a deposit or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that out?
Express message: heavy traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a major traffic accident occurred at St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the press alarm of the police is currently reporting (14:03 a.m.), a passenger car has come into the counter traffic during overtaking.
There's been injury.
I understand.
All right, thank you so much for being so easy!
Council and ideas on further professional life
Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is relatively good, because my dear head is shattering everything you can think of.
Before I get here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - so of you.
I'm just making the ref as a cross-country beginner.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call here nothing more precise).
But the whole thing was too boring for me, and I've been looking for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I ended up with the Magisterium and I was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are clearly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job listings".
And it's only half a year around.
At the time of the painting, I have always decided to continue and at least end the ref, after which I can still swing.
But just now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
Now there are vacations, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was my weekend and my party evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter at all at the moment.
Now the family party is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also bother me.
In principle it is fun and from the outside the Ref also works well with regard to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body endures before it closes completely - if it doesn't do it right now.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of the working life like this - especially if I read some of the contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, because where I was appreciated, I could take free time if I needed them, and the work was kind of boring, but was paid for it properly and together in a team what worked out and not as a single fighter like that now is the case.
But then I wonder if in a year I did not get back to the same place as now and was dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kind of crazy, but maybe you've come out as an outsider's advice or ideas, like I'm out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably does not lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the whining undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its launch in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has been constantly developing, which has, among other things, led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit that perfectly simulates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Also these amps contain, of course, the multistage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only sprinkle.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with Modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a new VOX Valvetronix series boost – with more dynamics and more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists are found here in search of a maximum amount of sound.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the end stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, represents the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counts of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually mirrored and foldable velcro parts it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits into the backpack naturally depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with an onset lens, two to three alternating lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-related things.
With the Everyday Backpack 20L, drone pilots also make an optimal choice, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the almost three months since the start of the outbreak, the lava streams on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa at 84 days.
There is no reliable data on earlier outbreaks.
Although the activity of the nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has fallen somewhat in recent days, volcanologists have not ventured to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowing down.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, the state TV station RTVE.
million-height damage
In the almost three months since the start of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava destroyed almost 2900 residences and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage was estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
It was particularly affected by the immensely important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and who were already in the crisis before the volcanic outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is at the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the tingling tension of a little seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of gift, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social treaty of natural peoples", can be avoided and re-filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christian Child Became From Nikolaus
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Prior to that, gifts were presented on Nikolaustag in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift the custom, popular in Germany, emerged to fill the boots, especially the children with gifts.
Protestants met this custom because they reject mediators between God and humans as "sacred worship".
For these reasons, they are opposed to the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child out of Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the gift was shifted to the Christmas evening.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely anymore, it is only annoyed that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period similar to the use of Martinssingen and Martin's move.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have proved a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, a cheerful cuddly mare has the question of who is now bringing gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the region in question whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, to which in time some peculiarities have been assigned.
This includes, for example, his white noise beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh drawn by reindeers and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, which should have led them the way to the Jesus Child.
In Scandinavia fable beings sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia paternal frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christian child is responsible for the handing over of the gifts.

Police are shooting suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped little later by officials.
There were shots and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police didn't come from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp blends harmoniously into every bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is easily set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spits.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Exposure time max. 10 h
- The robust plastic version can be used all year round in the outdoors.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatened objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in colour.
»Smart Stone«, on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in equal to six different shades of color).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturalally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself day by day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He is also doing well in the neighborhood of bigger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to claim thanks to his size.
Great preparatory work can be saved: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require supply or batteries.
Put the 'lightstone' in any place hidden by the sun.
Two provided earth skewers ensure a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module conceals »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, together with his battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dusk dawns, »Smart Stone« begins to shine on its own; in what color you decide for yourself: Six attractive colors of light – alongside daylight white – are your choice.
The switch-off is also done automatically as soon as the battery charging level has dropped to a specified minimum or it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.
I've done that several times before. It doesn't work.
Too bad, I would like to continue ordering with you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, then I will not order any more on principle.
If you think differently, let me know.
Otherwise, this was the last contact today.

The engine control of the LokSound 5 was again fundamentally improved.
A variable PWM clock frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz provides a super quiet operation especially for bell anchor engines – the typical "bramming" belongs to the past.
The load control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "autotune" function allows the decoder to be automatically measured to the engine.
The LokSound 5 decoder delivers enough juice with up to 1.5A motor current even for older engines.

Pill problem
Hello, my wife's people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I was forced to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to leave this again because I have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two years of break I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosion-like pimples and these everywhere.
As far as I was concerned, but it was quite a burden on me and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of break, the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without germination is my cosmetics already, but maybe there is what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, my female doctor didn't take me so seriously and the skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone:n who has read the novel!
Yes, the sweet skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time rest, then large-scale little braid and the acne theme.
I have also tried anything possible in the course of chr. disease and have remained dependent on sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that hormoneell is simply the worm in it, but if you have a construction site like me everywhere, you also prefer not to go looking for what else goes wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague Semina o. e.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work and get to the phone, and all of a sudden everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
But there is him in general in large
because it is available in large black

110 kV earth cable is being newly built 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The planned decision by the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This is now reported by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a mast of the transmission line.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipping number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is?
A nice start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest and the whole sides are put on, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The commode stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# terms
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment
Thank you for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The originating value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, so the question at #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning of education (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems to plan time-efficiently my teaching in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the schoolbook and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy b/w for free in school (which is annoying for Earth).
I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors, and in my case every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already chosen a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to complete the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G rule about the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or healed are allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales collapses.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations corrupt the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
In the case of transactions with non-dayly needs, sales losses were to be lamented, criticised HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions therefore lost almost one third of their pre-crisis rates in the last week.
It runs well only in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the Chief Executive.
"2G while shopping doesn't bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staffing.
The band system had to be approved throughout the country, he demanded.
After that each customer had to be controlled only once on 2G (vaccinated or healed) and had access to all transactions with the obtained volume on that day.
In addition, in retail trade - as in public transport at the 3G-rule (vaccinated, healed or tested) - sampling should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were at least 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, the revenues were around 90 percent.
These figures will now safely fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the Centers are attempting to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called volume solution where "the visitors can, for example, at a central location in the center once deliver their 2G proof and then enter all shops - equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel - unobstructed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filler to be castrated.
That looks ugly.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and glued it to it.
How do I go for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities for adjusting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The irradiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can light large surfaces at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in difficult-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage space, simply press one of the memory keys and complete.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when new switch on the familiar situation is restored - very practical in studio work when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with the same integrated - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight over the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can go directly to your phototativ.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by means of fasteners on both sides.
It was noted that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a side joint is included in the delivery.
Great is also a bag included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy, without any problems.
Shame, I've been given them and she's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a torturous comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in series of victoryless Hessen were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga-pleite.
But then the SGE turned up, and within a good hour the frustration over a full season start from the soul and won forios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke out a "Paul-Lob, to every single one who was with us".
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters who were still behind their expectations at the age of nine.
Patrik Schick had guided the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continues.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
The morale of his teammates was also emphasized by Christopher Lenz, who had been able to stand on the square for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus with him for the next tasks, but also sees itself well in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also players live highly professional.
Now you want to "go ahead step by step and stay modest" and "do the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
The next one is already on Wednesday during the English week an away game with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o'clock, Sky) is on the program.
I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me immediately again or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and place the order again?
Unfortunately, I would say that I will not order again because it has taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women shudder with hanging heads and empty eyes from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection in the 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers took a low defeat and in the quarter finals now has to come against Spain host.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must be different from Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semifinals, a significant increase must be made against the World Cup second of 2019 on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German advertising player in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was the backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted backroom player Xenia Smits and demanded, "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not on the height
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team with the pipe was not up-to-date.
Misjections and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4-resistance after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-stamp.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game was running early at 3:10, after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschcke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter final, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time did the DHB selection get a little better in the game and reach at least five goals until the break.
The little hope for a pick-up after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greens sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-imposed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates during the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer achieve an increase in performance and went off the parquet as a clear loser.
DACH-Adventskalender Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
In the context of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have met the Nicholas Day and take this as an occasion to dedicate to us family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas Eve and Christmas holidays.
How was that at home at the time?
How about your partner\*in?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What's the best thing for the kids?
Boot cleaning?
Bake?
Tree decorations?
Is music being performed?
Is the Santa Claus, the Christkind, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do, everyone gives in and around Christmas effort to have it as beautiful as possible as family.
Whether these are solid traditions, or even something else every year: tell us how your family went or how it went!
please send me some transaction number... or anything else that could help with it.
Transfer confirmation... etc.
I would like to present a voucher code
as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that what's going on with them?
The title is available, I work as a vaccinationist in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it will then partly continue in vaccination centres for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are personally related (e.g., "I take medicine X, this is with vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility is the education for vaccination, the indication (persons are entitled to vaccination according to corona vaccination regulations and no reasons against them), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (me have never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have one, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but they cannot (must?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an amberger, the BR television programme "We in Bavaria" has provided for intense reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" remained undecided by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go fast."
That, heard the people from the TV moderator, was totally wrong.
On which the man from Amberg reported the solution, and thus probably also with many upper Palatinatees caused amazement.
"The Skinler," the audience heard, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, surveyed by Bavarian TV for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical above-pastic term, derived somehow from the more well-known word "holdern".
What closed a gap in education - probably also with some who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy any more books in 2 weeks.
The following error message always comes after confirmation: opens - parting wirt wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice at the racing wheel- really so pan-safe?
This morning I woke up full of action because I wanted to train at least a little bit to prepare my bike tour in the next week.
Said, done, and I drove my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitters on the track.
Zack, booze, and my tires didn't want to go through the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real opportunity to get my spare coat and replacement hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around with half the bad mood and take the first best train home.
Then I didn't think it was that bad, but maybe it's better if I do it again before the bike tour with the change of tire.
But now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would get this problem very unpleasant more often.
Now it was really not bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike to 2:00 p.m. 120km!) and who also called it a suboptimal because he has played with them for several years.
But if I think I have to make another change of tire when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad mood :D
Now I got into the conversation with an older man at the platform, who was wondering why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they were supposed to be inflatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incomprehensible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I think I have 25x622 at the moment on the race bike.
There are also (seems?) the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me with other tires on a racing bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to recommend my absolute! lay knowledge rather the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and good regards!
Car tossing against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was hit by his car on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten for unexplained reason against a middle island and then hit the opposite road, as the police reported.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then dragged against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and brought to surrounding hospitals.
yes we have deleted all books all the new authorized and loaded new books

After the release of our new High End wideband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would get young people again.
SOLO 15 is called the new Spössling and is visually reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly with to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in which the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but it is intended to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is a considerable adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was tuned with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally common for widebands to optimize the over-frequencys strongly increasing grouping.
The SOLO 15 is exactly geared to the hearing area and convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone range can easily be rotated outwards and the sound image can be designed warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy that seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes in the construction process.
For example, if one wants to veneer the case, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the building market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the appropriate location to be able to carry out the cable there without problems.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opens in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used at a later stage.
Backside, this opening should be fitted with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw-up points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture 'Detail Phase'.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued to these.
The three stiffenings should also be used and bonded.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the thickness of the material if required, for example, if you want to use finished lines from the building market instead of producing them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circle saw or a forest drill, the openings of the bass reflex tube are facilitated, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall.
Then you use a round mill to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base can also be rounded off with it.
After that, the footboard is firmly bonded with the foot of the case and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the drawing and pre- Drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (blowing/blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and unbroken cable is pushed into the foot through the 8 mm bore through the foot until the terminal opening and leaves it standing out about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is brought to the speaker opening and lets it hang out loosely there as well.
The frequency gap is prepared and used below.
The design of the frequency range, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency-soft is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening is sealed inside the box, which is not yet fully closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and so close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and bolted with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and let it be delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> At last we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per turn, so that we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
