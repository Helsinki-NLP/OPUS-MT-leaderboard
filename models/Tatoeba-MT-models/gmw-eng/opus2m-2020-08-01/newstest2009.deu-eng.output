The Prague Stock Exchange falls into the minus at the end of the business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ's shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange joined the break-in from Monday when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case was experienced on Tuesday by the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to make up for some of the losses, thus reducing the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the Chinese stock market movement in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8 percent, while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the there index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said Joseph Yam, head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, although belonging to China, determines its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong move at the same level as those in the United States.
The US legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush’s view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost seven percent, and a similar breakdown was recorded most recently in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any evidence that the draft would not come through in the House of Deputies, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concessions: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators reached a breakthrough in discussing the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid to the American financial system to an amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory.
The members of the Congress have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The financial system support plan will be negotiated in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the president of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, said this to the Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, different information could probably be voted on on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, "disillusionment" results because of the complicated mechanisms, how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to their words, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the Government Fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which put financial firms in serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're the target," said Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to the words of the democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators have tried to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This means that investors should be reassured before transactions on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a Congress decision could affect the business on Monday.
However, it is not yet quite clear when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any clarity as to whether the negotiations could still fail in the last minute.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount for aid to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, the Congress can block the disbursement of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush is positive about progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can overrule his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained, based on the ability to obtain finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate on Monday," says Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and "estimates the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, announced that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of discounts and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to be responsible for the supervision of the fund.
This is to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates with a help for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly cost of the debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"That's because you don't know what mechanism and at which price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek said to the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive in Marek's view.
"It is very important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the adoption is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Duell on knife cutting: MP3 player against phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can yet make a phone call.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Despite everything, there are enough reasons why you should lay down an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
It's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason either.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream at least of such a one.
So this is also simplified with the music on trips, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but also a pink-floyd fan will be difficult to use headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The lives of the batteries are also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn't even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the simsen, it can play music and videos, both recorded, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And when you add the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelf hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the easiest) are much more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you are still making calls from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for security - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of continuous operation off once charged.
Another problem exists if you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, and not every mobile phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a memory medium, but only a few card readers are done without reducing the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players you do not need any special software except exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players create a music library themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can use more
When selecting a specific device, you should particularly check the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If for you music is especially backdrop and you only hear it every day, for example, in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which can almost every cell phone.
You also do not have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 all create, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most of the devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the respective pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself for why one should lay down a music handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is usually limited only to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sale of music (since it is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will continue to dominate the music industry.
Most of the cell phones carry them.
If you want to listen to something, grab your phone in your jacket pocket while the player forgets to be at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless accompaniment.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music handys will be in the price for many.
The cheapest costs usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are present.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest - player - can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operating with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an erratic mobile internet and a subsequent horrent bill for data transmissions.
Which device should now be grasped
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But beware.
The basic models usually only support maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you will not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, rather take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes to that of a single MP3 player.
The most widespread is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will come to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe it won't wait for long.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers work to the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on it on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the ČTū Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price of text here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the final steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone providers, text messages from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight break.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to argue that there is a lot of competition in the Czech market.
This is often the responsibility of the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past had often said that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, he would probably hardly find any more frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a clear price reduction, to which the classic mobile operators had to respond.
Before the entry into the market of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for long.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and thus ascending to the five largest provider of the country.
Behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually make their way out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to put on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and whom they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar approach could be taken in the Czech Republic, as in Poland.
The press spokesperson of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubted this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, without chance, the mobile phone providers mean
However, it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile phone provider conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobileking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
It will be more likely to enter the market of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a phone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Their interest in starting a virtual mobile phone provider has long been shown by the group GTS Nova, which wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only landline telecommunications services, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already achieved progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl's press spokesperson.
Maybe better times now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has a great deal of specificity over other markets.
So far, no subject has yet addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other providers also point to the specificities of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build."
And she adds: "By the end of the year, a virtual provider will hardly appear in the T-Mobile network.
At this moment, we must have a concrete offer to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses his attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the best from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider was more competitive, this would lead to lower prices and thus also lead to a decrease in profits.
So why make market entry easier for such a competitor?
That the providers can pull on a strand when it comes to something also demonstrates the long back and forth around the creation of U:fon.
The most powerful pressure towards ČTū was from the company T-Mobile when U:fon was on the market.
This also demonstrates the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and in particular its services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of ČTū, which unfortunately in Czech - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It shall have the exclusive responsibility to protect economic competition (UOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem of its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
Until now, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by suppliers' representatives.
This is more than worrying by an authority representing consumer interests and, inter alia, to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "For abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not one of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost already touching consistency of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same fuel price at the gas stations is certainly only chance and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate a competitive action, and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so neither does it have the corresponding increased responsibility for its action on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority," stated Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by ČTū, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different perspective - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the entry into the market of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for his network.
This means that he necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not go along with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the above-mentioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The aberration of responsibility to ČTū is then a rather common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act has not succeeded in extending the competence of ČTū to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS only have to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking at it.
First of all, the operation of some pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unobserved.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
These are usually companies operating in the multilevel marketing sector.
Private mobile telephone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts as a classic company customer to the operator, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar re-sales.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the respective society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
It is quite unlikely, however, that this is not the case with those responsible for mobile phone providers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not lead to any neglecting profits, at the same time they are not affected by the actual official marketing, unlike the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of customers.
Furthermore, they must accept that the SIM card is not running on their name in their phone, so they cannot have it fully like the normal customers of the mobile phone providers."
Even that would have to happen at least strangely to ČTū.
There is also a further question for the ÚOHS.
Before such an approach, mobile operators close their eyes, why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It must be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of providers, they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been pointed out several times in the text, the entry into the market of virtual providers resulted in a significant price decline in the various services.
Practically in all countries where virtual providers have developed, the classic providers have tried to prevent their development practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which in no way tried to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, were particularly involved in these moments.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves all over the case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot clear up the impression that there is more than no clarity in the competences in these cases.
But let's not throw the flint in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be back in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to refusing (discrimination) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will not at last make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem to my homeland on the occasion of the Czech statehood.
The hymn was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The song was written by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech radio that he had chosen for the solo versions singers with young, representative voices that are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear diction so that you understand the text well so that a harmony arises," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj appeared for the first time in 1834 on stage of the theatre in the originally Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound
The Prague transport companies also transport on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday October 1st, 2008 will enter the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus, which will carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or one-year coupon (permanent from 1 January 2009) at the same time as they can play on their chip card, in the information centres and branches of the transport operations at the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobellisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"There is also a switch with trained staff available to travellers at these points, which advises interested parties on the internet and also puts the coupon on the map," said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the opencard, which are mounted in some subway vaults.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminding of ticket users, the passengers may have noticed them at the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the coupon previously purchased is self-evident.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which especially the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian region reach the capital.
"In the trains that belong to the Prague integrated traffic, the train-accompanied readers have readers to check the validity of the coupons for time and time," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid. This organization sets out the schedules for the Prague transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout at the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown by the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked position at the side of the cash desk.
The driver thus controls the validity of the displayed coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the displayed coupons, it is no easier than to ask the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon is valid can return to the auto-service machines where the coupons are displayed on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the integration of the Bohemian forest into the United States.
This can be seen from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a desire, some groups of SudetenGermans should have turned to the US President in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive, which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter the Germans of Krumau ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudettengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberators," it says in a letter that is signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudees lies at heart".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans suspect - in knowledge of the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian forest for the present and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you have spoken to a foreign state that has tried to suppress and eliminate minorities and has simply contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," read the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposed to be the fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he were to initiate a referendum in Bohemianwaldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naïve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, he paints a good picture of the then expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to realize that one would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them agreed to such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
In the war he was used as a Budweiser German in the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoners of war camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," says Chalupa.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war were expected to expel him from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotion-charged campaign is aimed at drivers
Most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
Similarly, the emotion-loaded media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday, can be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš Łebíček promises to drive drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to take the drivers off the wheel from too fast driving and alcohol.
And they also remind themselves of being attracted before arrival.
The campaign wants to talk mainly to young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers in the conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are on a label in capital letters.
And in a blood slide the word "pay" stands.
This means that one can pay inconsistency to one moment with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normally pictures with dramatic pictures of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of fatalities on Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and whip for the drivers
"The motto of sugar bread and whips is valid for the drivers.
Sugar bread means that when they drive red for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Kořán Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, it is less effective to draw the drivers' attention to a danger.
"If you create a static table that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surrounding area, and the riders will no longer perceive it," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert has expressed his support for the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if one could make peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for this.
This he emphasized in an interview printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We maintain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to assign to the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to abandon a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister's words, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bear and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he continued.
Remove from the Golan heights
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria only and only on the basis of a deduction from the Golan Heights," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they will have to give to terrorism of the (Shibian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know, in a long-distance bus the walking is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the student agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers can walk on and off the bus during the journey.
"If we want to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty - two - year - old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the truck driver who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at that moment in all the accident next to the driver, on the least secure place in the car, although she had two more places available.
But a bus can also have an accident at the moment or slow down sharply, where the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with standing positions after the vehicle's letter.
If this is not provided for on the bus, passengers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standings; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not agree to the movement of travellers first.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet during the ride if they have their seats," he said.
The law does not know any steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the concept of vehicle attendants, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Hanzelka clearly adds.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem later.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing spaces in the product registration.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing spaces and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing positions and higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without standing spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP specialist in road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the Stewards movement on board a bus.
"In the event of a liquid mode, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it's not certain when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can hit the head."
"But if a bus gets sharp, then of course also the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and he also believes that this problem is not fully solved from the perspective of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not regard her profession as risky even after the accident.
"But once I get the impression that the Steward's profession is risky, I'm going to delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travelers as they get on board.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his bus. His company, however, operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have any stewardesses, against which we defend ourselves from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a liner bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was ill.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand without flashing and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two seats had been sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but it expects a financial compensation from the debtor.
A change of law?
Not in View
A more accurate regulation of the Stewards movement on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the ride," says Expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the Stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the employment protection authorities.
Düsseldorfer Hoffen rests on Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the house does not lack great words.
Through a combination of units of the Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurt Deka bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, it is stated in the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB broke into such a business a "competence block" with a sustainable yield power.
In any case, such a link could be the decisive source of further alliances in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
The WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute, which the North Rhine-Westphalian Government has just recently made clear, the time has come to find a future solution.
A connection between the Deka bank, which Sparkasse customers know for their investment funds, and the WestLB has been talking for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas informed at the end of August on the presentation of the half-year figures, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no meaning.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half borne by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbands, has commissioned the Board of Directors to hold talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The discussions have, of course, just begun at the financial square.
The Deka Bank, which together with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first to talk about consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked like the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, from this tributary it became nothing.
When the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's participation in them.
The two other houses did not then find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been games of thought about a connection between the Deka bank and the Landesbanken.
Günther Merl, CEO of the Helaba, had, however, recently expressed himself against plan games about a meeting with his house.
However, regardless of what seems to mature, it seems that a collapse of the various houses in the public sector is in need.
After the Landtagswahl in Bavaria is over, a connection between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could first be established.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, you will gradually expect the partners to do so.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has managed the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved in the Helaba with 85 percent, proposed a bar at the beginning of the year to join the West LB.
At all events, the Nord LB remained.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only the one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl, the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future of the Landesbanken, had not been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be decommissioned, but it is not desirable to do so.
Thus, in the letter of the Management Board there, it is said that a "total solution" for the house would definitely be sought.
As with the association of individual units with the Deca bank, it will still be shown.
The second weekend of meadows is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena as his girlfriend is with us, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built beard and proves to the about 200 October festival travelers what deep tones can produce its throat.
Elena gives Luca a hit first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will start this evening at 23.45 a.m., arrival expected 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved for the Italians in particular, on a bus travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat of fursitate lining and a glasses with wide silver irons, belong to the buses.
They've been driving to the October festival for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 22.30 a.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 euros costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brides faithful to the Bavarian purity bid, health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brenennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers will sleep.
Well, they're gonna need their powers.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are also several other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 just before Munich, which will take another break.
When Marco's group finally arrives at half past seven in the early morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco gives a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On it is left "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviagggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's called running," Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget to drink.
"The security officers show that we behave well!
Once you leave the squares, they will be gone!"
Third: "Today's evening dot half eleven find again here!" Understand?
And we're on our way.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as a signpost to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for the withdrawal.
It is the second weekend of meadows, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; the talk is about 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tent. Ten percent of all visitors are expected to arrive extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians in front of British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies take first place.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Insomnia nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasized Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also intertwined that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis-like developments.
Because this is what happened on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion credits from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulences in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The mortgage real estate only has to pay the part it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is the loss of the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has granted money, the state financier had been extremely refinanced in the short term - which is now no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's cash reserve was reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio was also slightly reduced from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial operations fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, the revenue from ascribed debt and certain securities and the dissolution of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher revenues from refunds from post-disbursement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the tax regulations and from the business management of Group companies, the profit-to-return ratio had been reduced by around 16 percent.
Following his privatisation in 1990, the former state-funded financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which were then distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of money in classical state finance, Depfa had then increased its commitment to infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make amortizations that will have a "essential material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
It had already been shortened by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since Depfa took over.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market than other institutions, as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely reduced, as the banks hear their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part - about 50 billion euros - of Depfa's loan portfolio for short-term funding annually.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for a foreseeable period of time and the company is "protected by the influence of the currently largely incompetent international money markets".
It can be heard from other sources that, thanks to the funds, the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be ruled out.
After the hearing after the bank was insolvency on the late Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue could not calm the moods.
The stock price breaks in by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
While priority debt is hardly moving, the rates of subordinated bonds are more clearly reflected.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the durations beyond 2009 are concerned.
It seems that hypo-real-estate bonds were previously a speculative investment alternative, and their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the marked intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the acquisition of the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less favoured commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to assume a timely repayment of pensions.
Or, however, what hardly dares anyone at the moment to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports overrun with the sub-stateization, only a legitimate hope has now become due to the likelihood of security.
In particular, long-term believers should make a few sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
In any event, short-term investors can use a final line to make a loss premium for future remuneration tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to kick: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before the school way, I had Bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone. Fortunately, I didn't pass.
The start of the class seems to be not as strict as with us at home in Lower Saxony.
The students are troubling in from eight o'clock until around twenty before nine a short meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was ready to introduce myself.
I'm not even the guy who likes to talk to people, nor is I in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, including blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I've been in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At the moment, I was very glad that I had started learning the language just two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all suffocated, squatted and wacked and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'necessary, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me has grinned quite wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was really pumped.
All talked and tickled and asked me holes in the belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then in the break, all of their Bentos unwinded.
My mother had made such a lunch box for me - this is a little different from the tedious German bread of breaks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
I don't usually have a pale shimmer, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It says that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then constructs particularly artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the rest snack.
That's what I read in my Manga comics.
I'm kind of excited to see if I can watch this.
'Why is Japan?', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I've always said,
"Because I'm fascinated now."
After all, I've been reading mangas for years.
And in order to understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a flaw for tradition, customs and customs.
And you put great value on that here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I didn't feel lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check if they feel the same thing if they behave similar to us?
For several years, the Internet journal " Edge" has published contributions by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think are true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without I or anyone else having been able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter impervious terrain because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, and some scientists conclude that this is a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with the human consciousness almost always include the side prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much higher in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the pre-frontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, one could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably differed greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analysed based on our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be scientifically accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualisation.
What results from the sensations?
I remind them that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fight" is the mental state in which we find ourselves, when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) reveals memory.
Thus, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which distinguish primates and especially people.
Related to linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling arise because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and the brain strains, similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in intermittent sensations.
In theory, I can't disagree with that, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels this way in both cases: But how can one verify whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
A shake flees in danger whether she too feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equal to life.
Although the neural comparison is further helpful: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if one could prove this to man: How did one want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?) have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of us (because the human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level is reflected here, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I sense, I do not know if they exist.
It may be thought that this is shortsighted, but I prefer to move ahead rather than run against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts behind.
It may even reduce the number of EM levels from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first leagueists had been sentenced to a forced descent in the last season alone, after all, the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Embarrassed Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her lost Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He foams - and beats back.
Late rose war with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unsightly fight with each other - all over the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, said for the first time for the reasons for the failure of marriage: "I had been unfaithful for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has only brought them to life after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - told the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband clearly failed: "It's a terrible thing," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "for the time being, Meg chews and closes the story of our relationship again and again."
It is also "unfortunate" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "remembered publicly of the pain and upheavals that mean divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently been the father of Twins.
And so close his intrusions with the tabling: "My life goes on anyway.
I guess I'm lucky to have a wonderful family that works well."
Prices for air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were even cheaper than 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After years of increase in prices on the hotel market, many of the nights of stay have already been discounted.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities were still increasing by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, prices from April to June were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The trend in Paris and Rome was most evident, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a reason American Express sees the weak dollar price that has led to a "decreasing travel desire of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the trend also showed up:
As a result of the kerosene development, on average, travellers in the economic class had to pay 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights were even more expensive than 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for tickets in the economic class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in the Business and First Class were much lower.
In Germany, prices broke down even more than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, the study even halved the prices.
On the one hand, the company explains that the reason for the price decrease is the declining economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market is fragile.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the removal of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had failed in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV will become a table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went persuasive about his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin walk of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the lost actors.
And so his request also found hearing in responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted the thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
His command is said to be similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation failed.
"There wasn't everything nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) owes the Hamburgers to the Mladen Petric's headball hit (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
The audiences already celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the Arena, and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class primus.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to order this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate certificate is more likely to represent the unpredictability of the league than the domination of his HSV.
The team with its late committed accesses - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goal-shooter Petric and the Jansen, who had been expelled from the FC Bayern - finds themselves slow, but still cannot shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the vote
On Wall Street, fear is going around.
First news of the failure of the rescue package made the Dow Jones break in at times by 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in his history one day.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer was listed with a minimum of about five percent in the minus of 10,579 meters.
The Nasdaq technology market was 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
The biggest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs bank amounted to almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Grand Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
Under the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum is to be paid out not at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option certificates from financial companies which could be redeemed if price developments were to be made in order to reduce the burden on the State's bank.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downside
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the USA do not solve the investor’s doubts.
The stock price of the Deutsche Großbank Hypo Real Estate falls and tears down the Dax.
The US index Dow Jones loses the state despite the planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deeply torn the German Stock Index (Dax) into the minus.
Despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks, the share of the Munich real estate financier lost three quarters of its value, the Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets went to their knees worldwide.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar rescue package could not be enough to revitalize the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points during the first trading hour.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.

Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Sins
For years a mysterious phenomenon in research has been causing inconsistency: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" space probe flew through space.
Because of quickly freezed fuel lines, you are threatening the death of the cold.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes where they receive additional swing in the gravity field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sun probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent the way they would expect it to be according to the old-fashioned gravity law.
Rather, irregularities occur at speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is evident from it that an attraction occurs, whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter makes up at least one fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists in Egypt are to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom money.
Six hostages are said to have been killed in a shooting before release.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are already under way.
Again and again Germans have come to the sight of Kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists, who are towed in the Sahara, are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well up and in safety, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already scheduled to be on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting continues to be unclear before the hostages were released: therefore, according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and had arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German mediator, the release of hostages is delayed because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The long-standing abuse of her stepfather led to a woman's killing, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years of imprisonment after he had committed eight cases of sexual abuse.
The criminal court in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle died in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he retreated to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who worked for a large part of her time volunteerly for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse she had been committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an zealous surfer and cyclist since 2006, had been "emotionalally dead" and had given up her life since 2006
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a confession letter, which ended up like this: "I used to bind her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This inconvenient story ends with the victim's suicide.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would end in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged with charges
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be done internally with the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be mentioned, is charged according to paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Procuratorate recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could be in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank cost more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" for companies and their members to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans have been removed.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged each year to the 700 financial enterprises that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it held, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to buy 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upturn are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records existed in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members of potentially significant costs."
Interests due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010 interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pences per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five Pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the increase in prices in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied security deposit
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused security deposit regarding the charge to have extorted 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government first give her full freedom.
The correspondents say that, although their suspension has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear within the framework of their release whether it will continue to be able to remain on its own if it returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she must not be granted a deposit because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Her lawyers apply that she needs a deposit to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, said an Awami Alliance Party Chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-backed transitional government had taken over power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, deny all charges.
Fears for the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of people carrying out vaccinations.
BskyB loses action in the case of ITV
BskyB lost its claim against the competition commission’s decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV channel.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the ITV station.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of the share of ITV from BskyB raised doubts about the ITV's independence, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communication Office ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he wanted to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. U.S.
The U.S. attorney-general has commissioned a special agent to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, which criticized the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and former Advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist investigator Nora Dannehy will now clarify whether the officials questioned during the investigation have betrayed the investigators in order to hinder justice.
Serious accusations including criminal actions have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a specialist mediator with the power to force the witnesses to make a statement was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice deposed nine U.S. prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the released prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican Congress members, while others refused to investigate the accusations of election fraud of the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are responsible for investigating and persecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be discontinued for political reasons.
The then head of the State Secretary General Alberto Gonzales, who was under fire because of the dismissals, was in office in the final effect.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the Inspector General critically addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, "delegating" his leadership role and showing himself in the process "exceptionally disinterested"
Other officials, including former Chief Advisor of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honoured
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured during the "Q Award" award ceremony for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold prize in London next week during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" cites the nominations for awarding this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in 1979 as a single in the United Kingdom and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later, he became aware that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main traffic roads, avenues, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-term locals it is difficult to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to North between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than after an active transit road.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the building block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for protecting and constructing the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council's Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, says Susan Stetzer, the district authorities in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue belonging to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street was newly paved and was set up, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this fallen alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said that it was actually the city's wish to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm Philip Minthorne owned was split between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the Extinct City"), has published a part of the discussion of the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows, and rainhouses past flying weekly newspapers".
With a few exceptions, the street has looked just as recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the road, not far from the door leading earlier to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of classified newspapers.
Some passersby said they would rarely have thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished up a little.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Discussion on bilingual training: education in English-speaking environments
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific assistant in California studies and senior director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's suggestions on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of afro-American and hispanic students successfully completing the school is lower than with white students" - which is true.
In order to complete this distance, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition phase in training for those who learn English first.
However, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing the distance in school performances.
Take as an example Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were considered good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
School Sixh Street focuses on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach after which the education takes place in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point that Obama should pay attention to, says school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach focuses on the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical education.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual training, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one could enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large number of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national associations of images have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and its own consistent support for bilingual training make predictions of Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing on the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently triviated the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the distance, he should take careful account of educational models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
Oil price falls around the economy as a result of renewed fears
On Monday, the price of oil has fallen sharply as a result of the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil dates on the New York trading market fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the freight markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences on Wall Street and strong vortices in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prizes reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, this month they fell to almost $90 per barrel to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the biggest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from complete.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
In a communication to investors, analysts of Deutsche Bank wrote that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the freight markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank’s analysts have corrected their oil consumption expectations by 20% due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and their forecast for the 2009 oil and gas price has been reduced.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been in the jets jersey for the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned an ineffective game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like it before," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon at which her developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, which once slipped out as an external defender and the other once 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make any special effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the jets reconquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points that the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the insanity, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reaching one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Exploited Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to make the 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least a World Championship title or a world record on every route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left out the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which may have been exaggerated afterwards, that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed long distances, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes over the past 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won the result 2:06:05 in 1998 in Berlin.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his guard two weeks ago and therefore could not train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back in rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for overly orchestrating his racing races, avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if this were a track race, and setting world records about the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the tempomakers had left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made its last start to separate from Kwambai, who arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
With women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems that were described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her run by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to rip out, but after 30 kilometers she overtook.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became Second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
Pride and the streets in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growths of the recreational parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glistening, loud and gigantic drift, lies a quiet city where pride and the complications of African American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first fully black town in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquets, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which it has made a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the German writer project at the time of depression – is in many ways a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, rich and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what is going on."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many here are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and parish member of the city's oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a stronghold of literature and on the other hand an example of the black culture of the rural south, sometimes condemned and sometimes praised, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on the hat.
And so right did the concerns about Eatonville's image actually start with Zora, as all of them call Hurston.
She presented to the world her home city in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech as well as Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Besides the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares for, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Widwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all kinds and what-even fits hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
They still remember Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston got into the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and clothed with pants, in a city that today looks something on its honorable dress style.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he was rocking in his chair, on a back terrace overlooking the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There was no big commemorative celebration in Eatonville, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood her contribution in the world or her heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston, published in 2003.
The turnaround came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western outskirts.
The proposal was presented when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred to the community.
"At that time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision against the school council "respecting insulting rather than my race" against Brown.
Today residents say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group concentration in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and they hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"They didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap present," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have overcome prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the resurgence of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was to be found in the bookshelfs, making it a part of the American literature canon again.
The long-distance project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what could destroy the district with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
Some years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track long-distance road revived the city, accelerated the whole at top speed, aroused real civil pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more guests, such as Rachel Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (named after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando can it sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior authorisation and some things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and represented by black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstandingd.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew larger, a higher degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better nor as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mingled as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is about to return to Eatonville College to work in the city administration or at the police who, according to him, might use some help.
And even the young people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York have daily the worst horror work day since the fall of 1929.
Suppliers still push the metal tea scales along sidewalks with loud foldings and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still roam between apartments, how human pack animals are loaded with around 50 t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast bowls on the citizens' climbings and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 hours a week.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the world's downfall.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people standing snake.
Not at the cash desks to collect or pay money, but at the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license", was for the same reason as I was a snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they were commuting, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had removed money from so-called drifts (a little bit of a building savings bank similar to that of cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, saying that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went to bankruptcy management and last Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, was Wagovia, another bank that owns savings assets worth $440 billion, in search of a saving buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shop workers brought the bares in front of me to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired running financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese parent market, with so much familiarity, referred to Lehman Brothers, the pleite bank, and its outrageous CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge of my living block around the 50 years, has come from our usual entertainment topics on Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I don't go in any more."
Muslim tombs disgraced during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaam's interest, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, stretched through with a red line.
The police accuses right-wing extremists of the damage to the grave at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend of the extreme right-wing party's significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an action organized, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said they were "too deeply shaken" about the news of the grave damage that took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria, after the country slipped right in the last parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties who received almost 30% of the votes, advocated a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign, and some of their constituencies were criticised by opponents.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headcloths and burkas and even announced his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which say that the extreme rights of the most politically powerful block are in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Lock on travel abroad for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star, who has been sentenced to child sexual abuse, has been prohibited from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges put up a six-month barrier after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel via France to Spain.
The Kent police were granted a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday, after presenting evidence to the judges of gliding pre-punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Amtgericht in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
One speaker from the Court of Justice said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police asked Kent at Ashford's court to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The police in Kent said she wouldn't discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokesman from Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the chief concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimise any risk that may exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused entry and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers insisted that he return to Great Britain.
Finally, on August 22nd, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Cork went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to demand that he register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Minister of the Interior Jacqui Smith is calmed down and satisfied that Glitter was stopped to travel to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character, Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up the concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are strange for the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expressive strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatres on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the programme of the month of photography of Flamenco,`reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is increasing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people'`anyone can be human, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to retain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me in creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the greatest flamenco master with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, created images reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, was and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Known personalities in Flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebriiano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, I like to take pictures of the people, get to know them, and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or encounter people, people you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today called 'Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is 'a great cow'.
He does not yet know what the action of the novel takes place and what it is all about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to continue to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is concerned with is 'a toll' and 'everything points out that he would not have to write the novel'.
'If I had been sunk, I wouldn't have done it, but I'm going to do it and hope to end the novel sometime,' he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and who gave their voice to most of those present, is compared to the old edition of 'Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen in the Theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was created, who wants to experience from 'exceptional adventure', from 'rejoicing at reading' and from 'more than before'; how he writes and 'disziplin preserves' in order to complete 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how it has influenced his vocation, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas, and which 'memorial images' it is the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American novelist acknowledged that there is 'no way' to measure and how one can know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is 'affects' and 'to disperse people more', so I asked the writers 'not to leave light' and 'to take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play: bullfight festivals were partly lost.
After the announced bull fighters found that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bullfight festival with which the feast was to be completed in Pozoblanco was set on yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfight festival.
Thus the feast was exposed to inconstant weather, so two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfight festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring arena.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had more to do with galloping than with his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he fought so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Amiñon (Álava).
Two police called on the drivers of the car to stop, so they fled.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the drivers who was 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the transport police officers of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the Armiñon city area.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometers. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee a country road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to the precise laboratory analysis and to the weighting of the bundles to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the 'double' mark was not in line with the license number given in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for for forgery of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was brought to a police station for hearing. He will be presented to the arrester in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effects of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she was trying to get out of her parking gap in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesperson of the California traffic police reported to 'People' magazine.
The witness told in detail that after 16:30 pm Locklear pushed through gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forward out of the parking gap, and when she drove backwards, she took several times at her sunglasses.'
A little later, the witness, who at first had probably not seen the actress, saw Locklear stopped on a nearby street and left the car.
The witness was the one who notified the emergency service because she had 'anxiously lived around Locklear'.
When the police marched, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street, blocking traffic.
'She seemed to be unorientational', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to make a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of officials result, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and brought to a local arrest by 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital after treatment, where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian United Left Association be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and representatives of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the Town Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to take responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out the way the party has to deal with that which has so far been a councillor in the city council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the regulatory violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that the formation of 'a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Herobook of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' presents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for shooting.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired at the works of the famous novelist, today explained Carci in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and will later be shown on the station Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, great fan of Galdós literature, assures that thanks to this film, his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to film a commemorative film for the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the Madrid autonomous community for shooting, is provided by Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'witnessed Spain', who chose the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been brought back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not expect the funding as with `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as at `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script could not be shot with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in 'Volver a empezar', helped through his usual working methods: he turned to the stage to the actors with whom one must first try before one starts to shoot and for those who did not cast, he appeared 'humiliating' and giving respect, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide help in theater and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many of the actors he meets in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates present in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés', nor, finally, the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'At the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you notice that it's only for success, and now you're satisfied when you've produced a movie', Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville honors a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother, Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women to fight for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and was committed to the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the period between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she introduced this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We don't try to tell about her life without preserving her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area', she says.
The production is based on two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerto abiera'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who, in exception, wanted to work with one of her former students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also counts with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in which he always fell in love.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in as distant places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
'I wanted to recall her, because I think she's one of the women who has a huge influence on a certain era and whose works no longer know any more and therefore she's less appreciated', Bayón claims.
The show takes place today at 20:30 at the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an atmosphere to perform planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the `Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize of Literature and the death of the two.
Thus, 'the Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the Museum of the House of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and is presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The USA can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then ruling idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all of America to Newman with his enthusiastic performance and followed her.
Look what it took her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retreated in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, that was a big blow for everyone.
'What one feels at times is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the biggest dredgings of his life.'
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerate.
As 'father' of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, in which the downhearted self-esteem of the Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to preserve dignity.
If only a few people remain in this hard time without virtue, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as profits: from the foundation, which committed itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, which died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to stand up to a deadly diet.
A wide wave of surprise hits to take home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of all of us has left," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today trust to try to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high demands on justice, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and then married Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful to him, although there were certainly many possibilities there were not to be.
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'From all the great roles he played, he was not so proud as to those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and the philanthropist,' they say.
The streets in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called a perfect street, and according to my assessment, she was the worst street with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, so that would clearly not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
I don't think so.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like these are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started, and we had not left our backpacks behind, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, it seemed that it was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow, some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip I have got, I can already think that the output has been falsely stamped.
Of course, if I were to be asked for a perfect street, I would never think of this road.
So I think we're still dreaming of a city well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and the human interaction, an essential element of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company).The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people in the room are who they are and even remember how they were dressed, can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It may also include those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that talks with her, and that no company employee is.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things it can focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, they spoke very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. People, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just one finding when you consider that Microsoft in Windows versions added some function and 'Extras'.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing in importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many skillfully pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt. I bring a small example of this.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the relaxation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshment drink machine is a sign attached: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints out a please to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, were using it for networking on the network.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear in the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to simultaneously bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso put it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well built priest.
When we begin to list the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waistbanded.
The English-languages call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. Legend tells that the name formation is connected to sport and is derived from Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' all excels because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) which these t-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company is not just focusing on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and cashmere, Cotton pants, T-shirts with strips, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very attractive.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is petrific, but full of joy of life.
Currently, the siblings Gruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, relocated her residence there and also made the presentation of the most important awards in fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penéloppe and I designed for Mango, and also I visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentinos honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, I too are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I'm happy to go through a city and watch women dressed like they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to grow around in the wardrobes of my aunt and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at the samples to look at the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real role of the performer.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and her professionalism.
Recently you've become 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old I feel good.
I find the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was little, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm a mother, because that's what my body demands and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss out on that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I'm going to give my child great happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and were filmed last year.
That is exactly what it is and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and wants everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A few days ago, you were on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection for Mango have been auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about them. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they are not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers who can be withdrawn due to the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authorities order that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installed in his car this system that forbids him to start the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholic, the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the General Public Prosecutor's Office. According to their data, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialise the driver, which is why he receives a course for the re-education of the transport behaviour.
In addition to the Advocate General, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of the Automobiles will also participate in it.
According to statistics, between 30-75 % of drivers who were shown to be subject to alcohol influence more than once.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents car start when the driver has made alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is determined which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65 % of the regular infringements already in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to launch this behaviour before it became a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented by ordinary means, and yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The equipment is still available in the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Deputies will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 p.m., the time provided for the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Chihuahua de México DF Airport, landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the Prince and Prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but her rays still forced her to use her hand as a parasol to see the royal couple leaving the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very well, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, that's it. Very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who give off the salve of honor.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long hairs weighed by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps she was told that a thunderstorm in DF is expected.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter of Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
The Best Premium of Fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no very excellent fashion designer and Bonvivanten than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded a money prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened, which are linked to the fact that you would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by pain, because his brother died recently, pulled himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewelry from ELAH, which was breathtaking. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino to the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the mango house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of red shield without jackets, for Jacketts borrowed them to the ladies.
Monica Cruz, has hurryed to the shop and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and to dinner she wore a long black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she was excited, reminded of the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after arriving (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There are not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And even if there are few, all are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and problems of turning off the working world.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called '1001 possibilities to relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing houses.
If you think it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual disproves such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered as you stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Sleeping
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be startled, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speech in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ) the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (beds of night), speech sought in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency at which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite a opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleeping apnea or with stress).
What you can do is do a series of simple prevention measures:
Do not try to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choosing a quiet game for the child and avoiding stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
Relaxation methods can be used for nervous children who are recommended to relax to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
Once the speech occurs in sleep, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will remember nothing that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it shows fear of a pair of appearances, it is recommended to get advice or find out why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to carry out a hearing and to get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming about and why it says that they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhäusern ... finally
After a long thirst track, Illhäusern on the field is finally back on track for success.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous goals and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, during which the attackers had difficulty showing their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was just past the corner, Illhäusern was supposed to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded in alternately only fenderflick with a long shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with the first two goals fought by Riahi and Temporary, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Ill Houses by Marais, who was exactly right to take a ball again, which had been averted by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the Il-Hausian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which required his teammates to continue to play down in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems in an illustrious Elf, which only retreated a little in order to 'compress' their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball went very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of fishermen, who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to find himself in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, founded by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, 'the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies to become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected to be determined by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of nearly ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Quiberon peninsula was closed by a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from early morning in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish-coach did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who have not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not surrender in any way' and 'don't want to go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who pay no taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and also Sam Mendes agreed to the cinema legend and the dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its 2008 supply forecasts
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threat of recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world holds his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is hoping for much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider issuing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday issue, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering disbursing more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were set aside to him.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a large part of its business, beyond their international life insurance and their pension in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.
Among the assets from which AIG might separate itself, its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the reinsurance Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in the Private Equity, continues the FT.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG has to make quick sales to repay the loans granted to it by the Federal Reserve of 85 billion, also to the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Tomorrow Meeting
On Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks, the New York Stock Exchange reported a historic case of the courses: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Friday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had been recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final downturn figures, the index Nadag, mainly technology, has fallen by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widespread index Standard&Poors 500 has fallen by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the Bank's rescue plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which would once again allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been struck at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 against, the representatives refused the funds he had requested from financial secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here, a bad picture is being circulated, which is not capable of accepting a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come 'too late'.
'If the project is actually condemned to failure (...), it will be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, the Red Bank) and other central banks to get hold of the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more', warned Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, even more emphasizing the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that goes away, brings the ruin of a financial enterprise' in the United States 'with it'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy Wachovia's banking business through its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing not just an American but a global crisis, added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The revenues of the state funds within ten years have fallen from 3,632% to 3,827% Friday evening, and revenue within 30 years last night from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV game
On the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another one to find out who came out as a winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, the QGs announced their own victory in this TV game, which was to be persecuted by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite admirable, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat clearly makes the better figure.
With the undecided voters, that is, those to whom it now comes, Obama emerged as winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, clearly emphasizing the 'nativity' of his opponent regarding these issues which were the focus of this first television game.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president', he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being taken out of the version.
He put his ability in the foreground to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, on the other hand, Obama', against this weekend a democratic campaign, in which Republicans were accused of not having captured the full extent of the crisis that is on the 'American of the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama spoke yesterday about 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election event in North Karolina.
He did not even mention the words 'medium-sized' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a decisive turning point,' the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's government, compared 'good economic instincts' Obamas with Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After once again stressing that he would even manage to reduce the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, was his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates gave thought to the issues raised by the plan to save the financial market of more than 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) which was adopted by the Congress last night and which is extremely unpopular among the people.
'Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and opposition demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred White Russians have gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the constituencies in Minsk's marketplace to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't choose at all: 'What's useful if they do what they want with my voice anyway', says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to the foreign observers in order to resume the negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-significance of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the imposition of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the narration', lamented Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, for it is important who counts the votes, and in us this is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move into Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore responsible for interfering in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the electoral participation figures appear to be too high and that the extension of the voting power in advance (26% of the electorate of Minsk) has paves the way for any kind of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that one election took place,' asks the leader of social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
No one was in the constituencies.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those most likely to be in line with the government's views.'
The silence of the night again sinks over the October Square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves for their success.
Discussing - From blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of her founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross's blood donation service during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994 aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to develop guidelines to prevent a further catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to report, at the time several provinces set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for the administration of blood canneds in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec began her work, barely 38% of the people had confidence in the blood-conservation system in Quebec, remember Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Due to the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood preserves and through the work in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before she proudly emphasizes that in early 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'confidence is something extremely fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of human insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we called for one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, which, according to which exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proved without any doubt that this disease was transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has quite a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which enable the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST allowed to shorten the time of incubation between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not see this, was substantially reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmission of AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is in danger of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that you have to distribute 12 million blood preserves before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood canned each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case where HIV was transferred over a blood can.
I think one can feel comfortable these days, if one gets a blood transfusion or writes to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year on the island of Réunion did the Chikungunya virus appear, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted over the blood by insects.
We have to monitor continuously," Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Quebec also needs to provide sufficient supply.
The demand increases because the population is ageing.
As anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebec's blood donors. '
In doing so, every healthy person who is 18 years or older, who meets the criteria of fitness, can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because they are sick, for example, of AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from the blood donation for one year.
With this 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can't donate blood anymore.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep them and to get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in the blood donation,' Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood canned tissues, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public umbilical cords.
In the umbilical cord, once considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand a year.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year," Dr Décary continues, which describes this navel cord blood loss program as very popular.
Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinal
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle sounders at the second and decide to play the quarter final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio was, qualified for the semi-final round of the U.S.L.L.'s first league.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetiesth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without a goal for both the one and the other, the midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to set up Matt Jordan for the sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had introduced a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semifinal, Impact will be measured with the white caps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved to the semifinals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series are defined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unity formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Platanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a stormfire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Platanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.
'He was too fixed on it in the first half of the year, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause."
Charest is set on the north
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's General Assembly was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
'Move the course of our last large border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the general assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis, and followed the guidelines entirely.
During his lecture, a kind of painting mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources as during the electoral period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even though he had announced that his calendar of appointments was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister is supposed to have for Quebec, that of a 'new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has recently been mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the north was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention any date, any amount of investment or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most some prospects for what could be more worked on: mainly on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' is in our vicinity, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to clearly show that he is looking for a national founding dream.
Quebec grew very much through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given, I will take this attitude again on behalf of the government', he said.
Moreover, 'with climate change, we have to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the northwest passage, which will be manageable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the country, the natives, and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful to deal with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pectist MP of Ungava) have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land treasures) takes up an important place, has begun the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity for 'one to create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Nord plan will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister in his office.
'Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethinked to turn the challenges into new growth and development changes.
By the way, this was one of the always-increasing themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the taking over of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
'By Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about the lecture that reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew to determine the future,' Jean Charest explained.
On the other hand, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program 'Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Wasserkraftstaudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
'That remains among us, but I'm prepared to be there,' he told his party members, which caused those admirable storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet excluded the possibility of holding a election this autumn, which is possible from the law.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was full, mainly because of a mission by the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'the constitutional objectives', which were readily adopted: The PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications, and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reintroduced the policies for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would have done much more today', Mrs. Marois, on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today), judged Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea," said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who comes back from holiday today.
Letters - A depraved country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz'-minister (which irony) in the Harper cabinet it was last summer that allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its fellow countryman in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and leaves a child soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one to fall into a parody of justice to estimate the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian lawyers' association in particular are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it is not interested that after so many years of suffering, a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently experiencing a mysterious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
The time has come, therefore, when there is no more morals: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and arrest a Canadian citizen, according to the opinion of a head of government, who is to date only supported by the minority (after 14 October he may belong entirely to the minority...).
Many voters believe in finding their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has denied itself from what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this release, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, Vice General Director of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold-making society sought a defamation of more than six million against three authors and a small mediumless publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public-transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander, but over the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruin, who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and the editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
On the other hand, the tactics of these uneven struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a common settlement that makes the opposite mouth dead and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on and going on in many of the countries where Barrick's gold works, there are usually debates in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not the exchange of ideas.
It would therefore have been sufficient if the Gold Mine had disclosed its books and files and had opened a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought this question to light.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes out petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, and at the same time disregard the views of this public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world covers only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not - is that the public, who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does this above all because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag-complain (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a call to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she demands that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding, which are fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies in this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to deal with debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, unlike what she suggests, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified action.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the senior Congressmen, Republicans and democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion, to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, is still to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main content is: a better control of Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public funds used, new orders to limit the number of houses invested on the basis of late payment, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to managers of the supported companies.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Deputies, and representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,' said the Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
'This is the fundamental point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily life of Americans will be enormous', said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a further failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline, which had been agreed, was that market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations late, were more in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular those intended to enable the owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the managers of the companies rescued by the State.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibilities of certain persons, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television stations.
When asked on another station if he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
'The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by the placing of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (subprime) before it extended to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally resulted in a freezing of financial power and into the ruin of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican MPs was it that last week the first attempt to reach agreement failed.
Since the democrats accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of the companies in distress should only be secured by the government and not purchased, they believe that the dead end is to escape.
In order to complete the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added a decision that, if the government were to make losses with this programme within five years, it would be able to raise new taxes in order to save its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added, if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of a further 350 billion must be approved by the Congress in a further vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the case of profits and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the pledge procedures relating to the apartments bound by the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to set time limits for the repayment and the payments paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, more votes against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'Of course Washington doesn't understand us', said Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his voters.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to check out.'
The democratic parliamentarian Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called the "Caucus of Skeptics", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizewinners, have written us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be pressured, and to consider carefully what way to go', he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again given the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank announced BNP Paribas that it would refrain from buying up its competitor in great difficulty since losing 2 billion euros (U.S. dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.'
During this time, on the other side of the sleeve canal, the British government was just in the process of grudging another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the British Bank's branches and customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to state since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Was the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His fine feelings, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a great continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and an unarist mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extremely quality feature.
Because in him a whole country reflected itself in the self-made man, in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific war, who studied acting art in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who fought for the rights of the citizens, was also the driver who became second in the 24 hour race of Man's second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him the unknown facets of this mysterious, reticent, committed and hypersensitive star disappear, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers in Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of the memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with it.
Then again the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) pushes into memory, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory is awakened (1990) that is disturbed by his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age is disturbed by a wedding that not all fulfilled their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Dirty) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, after his death was re-recorded and the Newman became well-known in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the times, he was.
Still him.
In his lifetime, epochs unite.
The youth knows him especially from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brothers Coen in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who moved away early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he assessed his all too expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only flew for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, cowards, or desperate people, with whom he perfectly reflected his slide and reflected his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of fine feeling and sadness.
In the flood of honors that happened yesterday about Newman heross, his close friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said extremely: 'His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of abdrift Hollywood, goes there.
We have often seen him standing with the foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was quite tasteless, although we found it to be fun at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed to his foundation for children in distress.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman got involved in the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest sense and in the broadest sense.
What was produced at the billing factory of Supplement &amp; Co.?
On October 8th, the negotiations in criminal proceedings against János Supplies and his compliments begin.
In particular, the defendants are accused of participating in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent injury and business fraud, and other criminal offences, including document fraud.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds extracted from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often filled with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partially transferred to the cash offices of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly into individual private funds.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented in connection with tendering fees, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations either.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices have been falsified.
The invoice blocks were bought on the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that tour north of Lake Platte, to which István Lados was sent by Jáno's supplement.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumptions to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-management of Budapest later on.
These invoices are to have been manipulated by István Lados and his compliment, András Łri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the reports.
One of the goals of Lados' " Exploration Tour" was a beer shop.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by supplement and co in 2003, the gastronomy company is expected to host the ninety-headed group of the Biztos Pont Egyptesület association.
Now, however, the head of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the locality at once.
Another invoice, issued in summer 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The fantasy of the billing counterfeiters was apparently not set any limits as to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in which accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá, according to the prosecutor authority, did not appear at all.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas of hvg.hu reported, it was immediately clear to him that it was false documents when he was presented by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were misplaced on the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company should have accommodated a hundred people was also wrong, after they had a total of 11 rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
Also mentioned on the invoice, the restaurant has not been in operation for some time.
The huge billing falsifiers have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency, which they have taken into view, offers travel abroad exclusively, and thus they have indicated Hungary's travels on the cash payment account, which was also contradicted by the company's accounting practice.
Moreover, as was known in the course of the investigations, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was wrong on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Stiftung Jobb Jövőért, since the operation accounts for only 15 percent of VAT instead of 25 percent of VAT, and the employees only issued machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had undermined the billing forces was that in one case they had declared "warentransport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment consulting, the prosecutor reported.
Further flaws of form - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that invoices issued to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyptsulet and Biztos Pont could be exposed as fakes.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing director recommended that the invoices should never be issued.
Another "error" is the forgery of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was at the time (2001) just in resolution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyptesulet was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the invoices were not issued.
Consciously fake
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the foundation Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is also currently in liquidation, is also expected to have cooperated with the addition and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the Stiftung Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the Atlasz Egyptesulet and Vööösfenyő Egyptsulet with fake invoices of a total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to non-performing services.
However, there was equally little payment, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, which the interested parties have forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Cubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft, a Budapest based fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices on the sale of computer components for the total value of HUF of approximately 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as a buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian to which the company documents were also to be delivered by Ivan Cubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has agreed to issue invoices in the name of the GmbH. to the associations Atlas and Hoppá, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on Iván Cubatov's explicit wish.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which according to the accused was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his compliment, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's foundation documents, he has issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlas and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cuba should have issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The public prosecutor assumes that Cuba may have collected 10% of the amount of the invoice and VAT.
Cuba is said to have misused even the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were settled to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarszágért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but benefited from these amounts for purposes.
In order to cover this up, they have submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices of the Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were secured in the search of the Árpád Kemecsei office in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now expected by some defendants to have a confession on the way in which they have already been filed before the public prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main accused Jáno's award were to be a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already pledged to report extensively on everything, his confession was still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether he is prepared to take responsibility in return.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement now plays the "indulgence" after his requests had come upon deaf ears to ease the arrest and house arrest.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and who have not paid them are on their own, or are at least under house arrest, this possibility remains denied.
The psychology of oversupply - or why we are willing to pay more
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the auction bidder.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to beat themselves in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
At both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which the enemy's excess plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should cooperate against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product and subsequently made its efforts.
In addition, another group was promised 15 dollars of reward, in case they came out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which had also been lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the group "respecting the loss" were ready to use higher stakes than those in the control and/or the "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the behaviour observed at auctions has so far only been justified by the joy of winning or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved by the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at a hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various infectious liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to vaccination against viruses A and B anyway, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms in hepatitis A occur approximately two-three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
After that, yellowishness occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery may take up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from the far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated it may lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells secretly - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who have undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Rightly recognized, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus banishing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, held for the first time in 2004 of patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this virus-induced chronic liver inflammation, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show, religious faith acts like a kind of "delicacy" that should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent belief in God affects human pain, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks, while they studied a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was connected to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary's sight would create a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other paintings and was felt to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were either to look at the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "in security" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "anxious", and they felt "rest and peace".
During the consideration of the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that one could also produce similar effects with other, highly acting images also among the atheists, but one would just have to find the appropriate photo.
"We had to find an image that caused very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality and do it in many cases," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can say with fug and right: it can be found in the pockets of the people as well as above its heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their vacation, to which specialists they go, and what they are moving.
And still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he suggests: These would just overlook the essentials of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal of ordering "all information about this world".
Schmidt stated that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asking about Status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions such as "What shall I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet research the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and to use it later so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is based on the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "If you look at what I am doing" - some people are concerned about whether the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the company's representative, potential power that causes fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the striving for freedom, or the desire to resist the power that many Internet users face.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
One example of this was recently the approach against paedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "orkut" and also made it possible to identify pedophilia.
However, users who were concerned about personal rights were able to breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully tried to challenge the FBI: therefore, Google cannot be forced to provide information to the FBI on a secret request even in the future with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully issued 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users or their web and search term lists has been retained for two months retroactively.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate atmosphere by using Google's services, the company frustrates with the excuses due to the conservative companies.
In the meantime, the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and which includes enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes and provides its services for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has been focused especially in recent years, thanks to the term "web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, it says, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can at the same time manage his profile on several common portals - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect with each other via other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can conduct blogs that represent the latest photo galleries that are automatically located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: when looking at last night's party photos, the girlfriend will soon find out who her unfaithful friend was enjoying, or the employee will be released, because in his blog he is only too honest with his business leadership - one thing is certain: The term "private atmosphere" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he gives up - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who tries to keep something secret, or even to bypass the Google monopoly, can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that does access Google's search engine, but deliberately does not leave any traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas are threatening the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-moving services are not only preparing Microsoft but also other software developers' headaches.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the management of the group has rejected a protest of the employees entirely after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, and management also meant that the multi-services of the employees are too expensive. However, all this seems to be quite mild against Google’s even kneeling in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all the regime-critical hits, or those who violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group’s internal regulation is that in advance no new service will be applied, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again strongly reverse some of the events: While some think that Google’s book and magazine scanning or archiving project now assumes that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "Health" system, which allows for the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellian manner a future in which a person becomes alarmingly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now questioned two young people suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, reported the spokesman of the Borsod Police Commissioner on Tuesday.
The young people were skilled and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to the news agency MTI, these are two girls who defend freely.
Aid is threatened with a term of imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is urgently suspected of murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigations, it was found that the 23-year-old had owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor on a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the action from a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden from the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapons of action and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange sets purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech kroners, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered to purchase the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange for a hundred percent.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they had previously been excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15", Poland's offers include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In its comments on the increasingly increasing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves on Tuesday already spoke of the "second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the US President, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President was not even able to put his own party to the draft law behind him, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-heavy investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, the danger is that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "day display".
While some countries could still provide rescue packages to their currency institutions, they could save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are pleading, then neither further financial injections nor other emergency measures help.
In the long term, EU Member States should jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid to weak money institutions, the Vienna "Der Standard" reminds us. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers should now take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which now fights like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "saviours" would not have to bet with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to state in which case it would be reasonable to use taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired in the creation of new accident-avoiding systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C-type biomimetic system controlled by auto robots, a mini-car equipped with bees' properties, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a field of vision of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board, which immediately initiates the collision-preventing process.
The obstacle is recorded in second-break parts, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it wasn't, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most internal and vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they avoid other bees.
And that must be in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, it can only be two-dimensional, not up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While the bees here are infinitely open to many possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational motion, or the acceleration and brake.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh said it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to save it, or by using previous maneuvers to produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so that it is constantly using only a handful of KB memory.
There's no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan, will be in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sintered child
Now the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and target the purchase of bad loans from banks.
In the first passage half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, members of the Congress went through a multi-day debate to reach an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American House of Deputies, and said that the agreement must only be made on paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson concluded: The program will be effective and it will be efficient, but more must be done. According to Pelosi, it was not about saving Wall Street, but about breaking the row of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (mean European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not trigger a high-speed flight on the exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Deputies will first vote on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then the Senate will be in line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars should be spent at once for the purchase of lazy securities charged with loans.
A maximum of half of the 700 billion amount will be spent in a first tranche, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum will be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened, bad securities, and the President will decide on the additional USD 100 billion.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the Congress.
Within the meaning of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "poisonous" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the concerns and the companies pay the expected costs.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger money institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the chiefs of banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their executions, called salopp "golden handshake" in the overseas snake, to be shortened by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys as part of an auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the head of the bank who has been served is transferred to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively turn on to ensure that the manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not amended - the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains equity rights in participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank recovers.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers will recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, on both sides there were skeptics who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not in any way protect taxpayers' money, says California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven forward by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared with August 2007, by 12.9%.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than those in July 2008 and fell by 3.9% from the previous year's prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly in bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6%, with shoes rising by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
The price decline was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry are considered in the annual comparison, prices in crude oil processing have increased most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price decreases were observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The rate of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase was recorded in August on the investment goods sector (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sectors compared to the 2007 comparison period (16.8 percent).
In sectors producing consumer goods, a rate increase of 6.8 percent was observed, with investment goods falling by 1.4 percent.
Industry's export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared with the previous month, but fell by 3.9% in the year-on-year.
In comparison to the euro, the domestic currency was 1.7 percent weaker, to the dollar 7.1 percent weaker, and compared to the August 2007 price, it was 7.5 percent stronger compared to the euro, with the dollar even 15.9% stronger.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force by the 12th January, as the Foreign Minister declared before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in a timely manner abroad."
However, she also stressed that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, have pledged their support on Sunday for the 700 billion dollar rescue package for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the government congress and representatives announced that they had reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its edge thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was melted down.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion dollar package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages of consumer protection which he supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "obsolet".
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time (...) but nothing is definitely an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also presupposes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of executions for top managers - something he had insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas Obama was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the spokesman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Deputies would probably vote on the draft law already on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so comments "The Mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution Destroys Her Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionably hegemony of a state party
Because already ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, which for the first time since the fifties has been among the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation of the CSU in the Federal Republic has, for the most part, destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this already 40 years ago, but at the pace greatly appreciated it. However, without any effect, secularization, the success of education, the inflow of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willed.
It is striking that in recent weeks the classical groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a higher education degree.
Support for the CSU dropped to even less than 40 percent.
The press (depresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Zeitung reports in her "Who with whom? Party leaders holding back on coalition issues" articles on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussion in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to define themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the heads of the party hardly let their cards look.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partners.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the bowl-molder course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
However, Molterer responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he thought, if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed in-house by ÖVP.
BZÖ-chef Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are willing to take over government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which will be organised by the EU Presidency of the Council of France this year.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MP of the European People's Party, in particular, pointed out the education segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of rights that Roma children face, and this is also the main obstacle to their need for validity.
The High Level Conference was opened by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the Fidesz MEPs, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for a job, Roma would be driven out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have secondary education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investment in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these links become as broad as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the stronger his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and through income and turnover taxes, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the Members said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the deregulation process in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," said Járóka.
Since last year's Berlin Congress, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the preparation of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling at once, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the personal debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice will be decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party.
But the much-skinned duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
With this they want to correct the angry political group and the party base that demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bayernic tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "own-regulators" in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
While the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule as a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructurings, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Justice Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which leads to a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" exploratory talks.
One irony of fate is that with the list "Free voters" Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislative system, whose anti-stubble appearance first took advantage of the Huber-Beckstein Duo, in order to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far removed the threads from the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called September 28 the "bitter day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few toxic remarks towards CDU - he felt the CSU deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
Should the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at national level in 2005, not be put back on its feet with a joint power act, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a hazel out of her disappointment about the Fiasco, believes that the loss of terrain of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no Member of the opposition made it to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies in the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but OECD suspects illegalities in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
De Legislative of the 10 million resident state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, before yesterday’s elections, the opposing party under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time had already "renewed" his presidential mandate during the unfair elections and, thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, this time, would "let" some Members of the opposition in Parliament.
Therefore, the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned Boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia’s rising prices of natural gas imports, and for the reduction of price increases credit has even been received, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of gas pipelines leading through the country, to the Russians. Therefore, in the light of the opposition’s expectations, Ukraine was hoping to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which emphasis was rather on positive movements than on the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - which is why oppositionists should not be present in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see a improvement in the political system: political prisoners were set on a free footing, for example, and Minsk is even too small a confrontation with Moscow by continuing to deny the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, has considered both territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevitsch to our magazine.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to leave even one opposition in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of selling stones, but yet I see that more and more people support change, even the older ones" - Milinkevich said in allusion to the fact that not even the most supported shift of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time for the "social security" ordered to break the silence of a cemetery," says Milinkevitsch.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, said the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in deeds, and not the words." Therefore, the lack of opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be made before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From today on, the measure will come into force against those slaucomees who will first stamp off and then go on to drink coffee during working time.
The new Anti-Faullez Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Treatable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," Brunetta emphasises once again.
With the Chigi Palace, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Council of Ministers Bureau.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working time; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile in this regard: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles".
At a meeting of the Public Administration Committee (Scuola Superiore della Publica Amministone)
The Minister of Rome announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people are more present at work each year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their wage dynamics - the Minister said - have been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to work against the Brunetta decree in the context of the vocation supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with figures about lower cuts in work - the Consumer Centre writes - the people of 'active lazy' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered to declare war on the illegal standards of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) will fight for additional financial compensation for work-related disease; the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made, and other aspects of the renewal of the Minister will be challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain invalids throughout life.
For 2007, the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) data confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will spend the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming, data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to support the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion".
"An outraged "basta" has come up with this; understandable in the case of tragedies, which, measured in their order, trigger some vertebrae in the media and take part in the public. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it has to be strongly invested in education and information."
A particular importance is attached to the numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness-raising in school frameworks by young people who feed on the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not divert from its social seriousness. One must put into force and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Board of Directors, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us, forcing all institutions to work towards firm rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data of accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of accidents at work is far too high," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against them by various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already beginning at school."
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - as regards communication and the awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is needed towards a phenomenon which represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of the protection of victims of work accidents" and advocated the "absition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations decided on by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 player in charge: risk of hearing damage
Sound music over a long period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission says in a report today in Brussels, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report – as it says in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear music with portable music for at least five years per week for more than one hour per day risk the permanent loss of their hearing".
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, damage their hearing without knowing it irrevocably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – as it is said by the European Union – there is a clear risk of being too quick to act.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information a common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - the EU's Communication concludes - confirm that there is too much concern and that the European Commission, together with the other Members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could result from excessive noise.
You can limit these damage very much, in which you take on solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise suspension.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if the users of portable music equipment hear music only five hours a week (just as 89 decibels) so that the legal boundaries that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This therefore amounts to 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, in March it will be over, and in June it will be taken stock.
This is the process set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome". This morning the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all the political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemanno. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political representatives of the City and Municipal Council remain.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve again, as such a project must have a fixed deadline.
In June - according to the Lord Mayor - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Those who question the competence of the Commission, because their view of liability lacks, Alemanno answers: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period of time in view so that we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The mayor of Rome places great importance on clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think. It will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, much to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama is the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the economy of the U.S. and had relations with Islam (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more intense, especially now where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!".
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a big advantage.
In this case too, there are people who talk to the heart and not the head.
A Mississippi newspaper, located in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial book: only in the election hall will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here there is a mentality of the U.S., which has been kept hidden until last.
"Tell us what you want, then we'll decide for whom we're going to make our incense, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something that has never been heard before – only now where the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: what mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% have replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains a weak place for the majority of Bush.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked about the future by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express any concern about the information concerning those responsible because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arise through the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the paper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists say – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking considerably.
A clear but complicated pessimism is now fulfilling the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and Executive Seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web goes.
The most important publishing groups are heading the way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology, hoping "they will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack exists in American journalism today between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level only 23% are.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "readers", ant. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and internet operators, employers like it offer them a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editors get very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance payments.
As far as vacation is concerned, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often become "sick" over the course of the year.
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBET IN GREATAFERRATE
The President of the second Chamber of Penalties in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the real estate agent's application, which had asked him to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (to which the prosecutor had declared himself) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence indicting it.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's 700 billion dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the course of the Republican Party is disuniting more and more into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "the people in Washington" and the financial world and, above all, wins voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This just mentioned example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the USA, also throughout the West and perhaps beyond will be affected by these.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-afraid events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links with abroad and at the same time manage a huge amount of the assets of households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: that is, how it is to be done with the families concerned, which is also a huge mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears to be economically global, and politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have turned its back on itself and lost its right to speak: the elucidative evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, because of its division into various national and international conflicts, is unable to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States in the economic situation can save itself without any other help.
In addition to the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two conditions that are not too overvalued – in certain circumstances – which otherwise will not be able to use international organization and market in a similar way.
That new emphasis, which is placed on the national-state element, is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that is recently associated with a closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, when we were so convinced of having long since entered a networked total empire, into a realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of immaterial, that at once we need to see how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While these can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are linked to an extremely narrow piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another person who lives in an unprofitable, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief boost.
Whoever territory, who is government, who says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leadership, i.e. those of economy which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an impatience, an image of indifference, a feeling of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems that it is the conviction among many of the people that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority of them being more and more foreign and traditional.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a branched but powerful movement of depowering the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the unmediated transformation of the collective state of mind of the past time: beginning with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of rights in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding, and therefore less representative value regarding what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today and is even strengthened and driven from the financial crisis to over-dimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
However, keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The superstick that lets go up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the target.
With a adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the adhesive can be seen as a series of tubes arranged for a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic fairy tales that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sand paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "let it be removed from the wall without problems", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Department of Engineering at Dayton University.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
For example, to go up to walls like Spiderman? Maybe, but the researchers think of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical appliances, because the nano tubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the space area.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new glue type.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, cleans itself on a surface itself from the dust and thus always retains a perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness, above all in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of both packed and fresh fruit juices in combination with medication intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again gave an alarm: it is sufficient for a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs so that they are virtually eliminated and thus the health of the patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FAMILY – The same agency of the medicinal product had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mixture, and stressed the need to pay attention to what is being drunk in conjunction with means such as diazepan or metadon.
IT IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicinal products.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
The appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano, therefore states: "The results are usually passed on immediately to the various international manufacturers who are so free to modify the consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you read the package leaflet always and, if there are still uncertainties, do not hesitate to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," emphasises the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Economic Nobel Prize to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more crucial to the history of the USA than the attacks.
A prediction that did not receive a small amount of polemics in response and was held to the economist years later, but proved to be entirely correct today.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals disappeared from the public field in the context of Enron or Worldcom collapses," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "econom of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The date of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under free-lance and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some innovations: in addition to a revised and now more sparsely designed start menu, a reason for ensuring compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight were also opposed to the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while at the same time preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which expands the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by different users in more hands, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a fraction to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result will be made public.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download 3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if free movement of costs can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also particularly in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed in the big throw: after all, several public administration and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at removing Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of better-known access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Even coal tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case in the context of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who as a third-classified winner and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl by the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver, who was tested positively for Cera, the third-generation epoch. Previously, this was done with the Italians Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples are among those carried out in the last few weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
Now confirming the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epoch, and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian experts.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the stage behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEMA IMPLEMENTATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FREQUE: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up with reluctances.
Do this from Belpaese make a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young, from Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times call "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and job opportunities exist", yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is to be seen".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster eviction of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underscores the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the latest study of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits. Whole numbers of students lose their right to study as effectively as their families are unable to support them at this level" - according to the Sunia, Laura Marianai - "in these cities, the great demand from the students leads to a deforming of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorised rents.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures which lead to a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
On a closer look at the investigation, it turns out that Milan needs a dormitory in Brianza's quarter about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in Vittoria district.
A sleeping place in Florence costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Few deeper are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who escape outside can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room, the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, the Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities in which the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental, which is 25-30% above the average, is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinemas
The historical cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex kinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of excluding the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sal complexes in the periphery, means long-term death for the one-sal cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
Most of the historical places affected are full of memories, "It is like losing a friend with whom you have left a piece of road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which brought him 20 years ago the Oscar and the great price of Cannes. It is about the history of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the vast amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these tokens paid mostly the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This is evidenced by the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex kinos, because they are precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been recorded: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy is leading the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but the first thing is the preservation of the already existing one, because a hall in the city closes, not all of its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the lack of budget for the fund of the trade association remains clear: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros in the year would be necessary".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinemas, has decided to protect them by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures foreseen are tax advantages for cinema operators as well as advantages for the public in relation to local transport: it will be allowed to travel to the restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It's a delightful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and in addition, I will design new concepts.
But surely we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because finally the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the attorneyship of the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, arrested this morning for being in Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also taken into hand: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation sum of 10 million euros for the development in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm disrespects," the lawyers write, "had the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
"This made it possible for the Mafia group – according to the judges – to officially enter the town halls and to define the policy of public administration."
The President of the Calabrias Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "everything other than an exception is to encounter connections between local administrations and organized crime." "There are places in which the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such links are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July with which the Clan Piromalli police decapitated.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of their local offices had been deposed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle-Right Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He screamed scandal as the prefecture ordered the resolution of the council.
He was interested in the vice-president Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons. However, the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change of the A3 project.
From a hearing action in connection with the Dal Torrione case investigations, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around Piromalli – which has made the public administration's actions identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-distinguishing source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and only now does this seem to be understood by the major energy companies in the world.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and are also looking to occupate, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; not by chance, these studies have been considerably intensified since the first oil crisis.
As the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gasped, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now relying on marine energy generation.
"Chevron investigates these technologies," says the spokesperson of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the opportunity to work with us."
This is about the procurement of an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off Alaska's coast.
This is not an underestimable sign, especially considering that oil is still being promoted by the US in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not familiar with the details, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Further improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still under way, not least because the last doubts have not yet been resolved by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and also Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it takes technologies with far greater environmental impact.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected bows.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
It drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for the state permit. Part of the energy obtained could also serve military facilities.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a department store and a park latz with the help of underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest is presently worthy of the potential that lies in the tides.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
Tidal energy is what led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
