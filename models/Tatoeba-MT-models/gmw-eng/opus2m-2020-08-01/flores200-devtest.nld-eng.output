This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-coloured underside.
The find also gives insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but have other characteristics of feathers - such as penetrating.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to control the temperature or what it looked like. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this sample shows adult feathers and thus does not show the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the plumage of an adult and not the dung of a chick.

Four skiers from the women's group for the sitting slalom could not finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to place themselves during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were recovered by Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish woman's rapists were arrested and found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them got hurt.
However, the driver did suffer serious injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services were trying to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been sentenced to killing her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then.
She's in custody awaiting the charge and the trial, but the eyewitness report may be perplexed because her story has been published many times.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have labeled the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photographs, etc. of suspects.'
Crown Office has the overall leadership over prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements are made, at least until charges have been made.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted to do on the basis of the borders for the Middle East war in 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only prepared for a five-year presence.
Sagittariuss in the additional test for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest guards, because the test was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation had an extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swung into a nine-headed new presidential council (Provisional Electoral Council of CEP).
That's what Martelly has achieved in the last four years, five times a CEP.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of the former National Election Council, which is part of a package of measures so that new elections will be held in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that has taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported of defective iPods that get overheated, resulting in six fires and four people with slight burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) indicated that it was known for the 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called "not serious".
"Very sad," said the Ministry's response to the fact that Apple postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07.19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Calamities Management Office stated that no damage was reported at national level.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Filipino capital, a former Filipino policeman has hostageed Hong Kong tourists by busping.
With his M16 gun, Fernando Mendoza shot the tourists.
Several hostages have been put to safety and at least six fatal victims have been confirmed.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Philippine photographers.
Later the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine, following the example of his father.
He was trained as a obstetrician at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins conducted early birth studies in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the foetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Also fellow warriors paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons, as unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels indicated that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more weird... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled for the federal election of 2010, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic, with 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal elections campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that Australia should become a republic after the government of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of the participants in this survey supported this position, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last prince of Australia.
29 percent of respondents thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31% said that this should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three escafette matches during the Commonwealth, but his condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the drugs he needed to relieve his pain because they're banned at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematical and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on 25 January the largest known prime number at the moment.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets are created, and they especially want to know how the earth came into existence, given that it has been a long time since comets came into conflict with the earth.
Cuomo (53) was instigated earlier this year as governor and signed last month a law legalizing marriages between people of the same sex.
He called the gossips "political nonsense and chat."
It is speculated that in 2016 he wants to apply for the Presidency.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes according to the FAA, which could save millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It makes use of satellite-based technology, unlike older technology with earth radars, which allows air traffic controllers to better locate aircraft, and to provide pilots with clearer information.
There is no additional transport and there are no above ground trains at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on the site.
A possible lack of transport made it more likely that the game would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was on the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, thought that this process lasted much longer because the crawling of an indigenous Darwinvink, the Middle Land Basin, with an immigrated Cactus ground fin, the Española land fin, lasted longer.
Gold can be made into many forms. It can be rolled up in small forms.
It can be pulled into a narrow wire that can be rotated and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After being made very thin, it can be glued to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'enlightened manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You're already making an indicator using red carbon juice.
Then the colour of the carbon juice changes according to the acidity (acid to base or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value shall be indicated on the basis of the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders, wet your hands and clean them and make them a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of cover.
In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a wash-through toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewerage remains have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Moreover, there were already toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. Thus, in the era of the Romans, toilets were often part of a people's bath house, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Once the space satellite receives the call, it will be returned immediately.
The satellite is shot into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the earth distorts part of our light and image.
To run a satellite or telescope in space, you need to have a huge rocket that is over 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are cats of average size eating between that prey of average size, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as loose cats kept as pets) who hunt for larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niece, a special job that every cat has so that they will not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Forces consist of one to three adult males who are family of each other and also have as many as 30 females and cubs.
Women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A band of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that look surprisingly much like lions (but not other big cats), and which are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump long distances and has five times as much tensile strength as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger does not roar with full power like a lion. It's more like he's grunting a whole sense.
The favorite meal of ocelots is small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds as they can. The ocelot almost only hunts for animals that are much smaller than it is itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their scent ability to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling to the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark by night vision and move on very inconspicuously, hunting for prey by dealing with the surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is released from the large population from which they originate (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or by moving to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they are often located in a different environment than before.
In this new environment there are other raw materials and other enemies, so the new population needs to take a different look or adjust to cope with competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different from the appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Type formation is a non-avoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that inhales people and they absorb carbon dioxide that exhales people.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants extract their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothes are made of plants, we eat mainly plants, and without plants animals would not survive.
The Mosaic was at the top of the food chain of that time, and he had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other mosaics.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the sleeve, which means that nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but it's possible his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, big fish, other mosaics and maybe even his own companions.
There was nothing safe for the attacks in water parties; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were not a party for him.
Although most of their food would be trusted for us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual delicacies, including eversweeds, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
In addition, there was a difference; poor people and women were sitting on chairs during the meal, but rich men liked to have a banquet together where they were lying on their side during the meal.
Meals from ancient Roman times do not contain food that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Furthermore, no old Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians made all their gods a primary temple. This temple was seen as the own house of that god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods with the organization of ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room accessible only to priests.
Sometimes as part of the temples, towers were built in the form of pyramids, called zigguratten.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family was often out of place.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no big forests and therefore wood was enormously expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants. According to Norwegians, Erik de Rode was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way to the west, and gave it his name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes there at that time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the persons, the royal family, habits and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
Perhaps after the film National Treasure, you think there's a treasure card behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is based on a misconception, but something is written on the back, but it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776'. The text is at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (of 293⁄4 inches at 241⁄2 inches) was once rolled up for storage.
So it seems that the label has just been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were French who came to the side of the Germans in 1940 and thus with the enemy cried instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allieds invaded with Operation Dragoon South France.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated South France within just two weeks and then went on their way to Germany.
Civilisation is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means civil, the term civilization, which is related to the Latin Civilis, which then stands for citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A cultured civilization suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, 13 states under the articles of the Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
It lacked the power of the Congress to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judicial authority and for the execution of all decisions relied on state authorities who often did not want to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between States.
First, all states had to vote unanimously with the articles before they could be adjusted, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team together with the German team is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fights, rugby, bicycles, hockey, scooter hockey and F1 motor races.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of about 7,000 islands (with the largest island of Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is geographically often referred to as a 'island'
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when seamen from Europe carried along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the south-west of Taiwan as a base for failure, where the VOC started the indigenous cereal production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty crews (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Shimonoseki Convention, in which sovereignty over Taiwan is transferred to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Built up of three large constructions, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Frames.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better picture of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the renovation is still under way.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analogue film age.
These are produced to the present day, although it is especially the ratio of the image that took over the image sensor from the digital camera.
Strangely enough, 35 mm-film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The image ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would in that case be 3:2.
Many common classifications (e.g. GSP-like classifications) are equal to or a dense approach to this image ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is much misused and which many find ridiculous, is a simple directive which makes the image dynamic and yet obvious.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. This allows you to share the image vertically and horizontally in three (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has associated European states, despite language differences and differences in habits.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-embracing power influenced everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and that is why the church has funds.
The church has been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money has led many people to begin to doubt whether this principle was respected.
Great Britain launched a blockade at sea against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy turned out to be effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital provisions to military and civilians, but this blockade did preserve the generally accepted international law, which has been laid down in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed mines in international waters, so that ships in all parts of the ocean could no longer sail, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country’s unblemished undersea warfare.
During the 20th century, most citizens and nations had an attitude towards pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever taking place.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a bundle and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different periods of time; every phase of China or every ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the various dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han- and Jin-Dynasties.
At that time, intense wars took place between various nobles who fought around the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had great social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the notion that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
For all male applicants, post-revolution functions were to be achieved, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same applies to the army, the army ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the calibre of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class to revolution in other countries.
Mohammed was intensively concerned with overground issues, and often went for reflection to a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mount of Noer.
The cave itself, which has endured the tooth of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountain tops on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not at all easy to find. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful air and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little of this world to see or hear from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven world wonders still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and belongs to the countless large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased Pharaoh.
The Plateau of Giza or 'Piramides of Giza' in the Egyptian valley of the dead contains various pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sfinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built as a tribute to the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a niece or a square whose bottom is missing.
Above means you have to start at the point and push away the iron. Below means you have to start with the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the iron) and put on the iron stick.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal signs, but do not forget that the printed iron marks are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a group of market women were after the departure of the Death Bangue Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They went back to the French capital in a carriage surrounded by jueling and threatening gnats threatening the King’s pair.
Because of the actions of the crowd of people, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, someone in the crowd held the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles in front of the eyes of a death - spanking queen.
The costs of the U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism largely rested on the huge profits of the prolonged exploitation of the Philippines.
In order to understand the Templars, one needs to know what the context was that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages. These were followed again by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have these two general concepts: the development of technology follows a path which, for the most part, extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than those socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to road construction.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, which is why new methods of production are being developed so that the cost of ownership can be reduced.
The mass car ownership also causes a greater number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new health care techniques in order to be able to repair the human body.
Romance included a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romance, geography formed the individual and in time customs and cultures developed according to this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the present fashion capital.
It was known from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time Paris also took over the title of fashion capital of Constantinople.
The Gothic Fourth are timepieces in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the west were left with 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, there began to be a style of its own in Western Europe, one of the greatest developments being the result of the crusades: people began to use buttons to confirm their clothes.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is agriculture where sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture for the purpose of living is a simple system that is usually biological, using stored seed that comes from the eco-region, combined with alternating crops or other relatively simple techniques to optimize the yield.
In the past, most farmers used to work in self-sufficiency, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that equal persons who feel neglected are brought together by social standards, thus enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to by means of a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods of illustrating the importance of socialization was the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults by neglect, reluctance or willful abuse.
They are called "wolf children" or "wild children". Some wolf children have been imprisoned by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the serious mental or physical restriction of the child.
Unhandlable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were left or before they left.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived only in the wilderness.
A popular child who has not been raised by humans can show behavior that resembles the behavior of the child that has cared for (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Learning on a project basis needs to simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who have a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or start a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but the paper clip man of Microsoft Office is also.
There is virtual scaffolding that is built into the software that asks questions, provides memory support and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons why children get into foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, yet this happens.
We regard the nursing care system as a safe zone for these children.
It is intended that the nursing care will ensure a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In foster care, all the needs neglected in the former home must be met.
On the Internet, components of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The various characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivation aspects as 'personal involvement' and 'sustainable relationships' when they examined public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that take a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that no one can recognize a lie by watching only micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people can't understand that speech because of brain damage can accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation new genetic variation is added; by selection this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination vary between the two groups.
A primate with an digestive system that looks like man's can be on the savannah but difficult to extract the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found there.
Furthermore, it cannot have serious consequences: growth lagging, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The easier to find plant sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are for primates such as we are difficult to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) slightly digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solve their 'protein problem' in the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep break means you wake up with a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep within a short period of time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without immediately awakening.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room. In this way you have to get out of your bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, a lot of fluid drink before you go to sleep (and especially water or tea, a known diuretic).
The amount of inner calm that a person has over the amount of stress a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Each person is able to achieve satisfaction and total peace.
Everyone can lighten his or her mind, just your own stress and negativity are in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism is extended with the mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from the Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a imitation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini-yoga (light energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as a focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras activated and consciousness is brought into a enlightened state.
Since Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, a cooperation between the USSR and the US was established, and when the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to fight together.
The former allies stood opposite each other two years after the end of the war, which was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would take 40 years and there were battles with proxy armies taking place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the head of the bridge in Romania.
However, these plans were obsolete in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, which was contrary to the Peace of Riga, the Soviet Non-Agricultural Treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Ship freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the responsibility of the Navy to ensure that a country retains the possibility of transporting persons and goods, while the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods is properly hindered.
The US tried to get men and materials across the Atlantic from the British, and with this North Atlantic WOII campaign, this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic with the help of mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats have been domesticated for the first time in the Iranian Zagros Mountains some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and peoples began to keep them so that they could always easily come to her, flesh, milk and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks on a hill or other grassland. They were then guarded by goats, just as the more well-known sheep-herd is often a child or younger. Nowadays, the same way is kept.
Already in the 16th century, horse tracks were built in England.
Although horse tracks consisted of only a rail of planks, the horses had to walk faster and move on larger quantities than on the rather difficult roads of that time.
Cross beams were used quite early to keep the rails in their place. However, gradually one realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767 the first completely iron rails were built.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People began to walk upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, ran up less often.
Two-legged specializations were found in the Australian fossils of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and the Sahelanthropus was probably already on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement or even take action to ease some future suffering.
It is in many cases just like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we have to determine the cause of the problems and remove them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly changed the earth, and overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have worsened the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printery a few streets away. This draft was signed by the president of Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap Broadsides'.
John Nixon gave the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July and read to his troops in New York on 9 July. Another copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap-flights are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a dinosaur species still exists today, and we call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things of birds that still remind of a dinosaur.
On their feet are claws and scales, laying eggs and walking on their two back legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The manipulation of data encoded in binary numbers is the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be diagnosed directly.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
See the label for specific EHBO instructions for that precise poison.
This group of insects is formally called "wants" by entomologists.
This term is derived from an age-old agreement with bedwants, which are insects that can paralyze man very well.
Both red predators and bedwands are nested, they have adapted to live in the nest or the house of their host.
In the U.S., there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it the main neurological condition in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, the spinal cord and the eye nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice as much chance to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These sets can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
When adopted, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main objective of science, which is the directive for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experimentation; a test is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, raise questions and make observations, as a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because of the decline in Greek knowledge.
In physiological and behavioural perceptions of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Organic clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that pass through a cycle for a given period of time, even if there are no external signals for this.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses for implanting their own DNA in a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out, one of which marked the DNA in the phase with a radioactive phosphorus and the other marked the protein of the fag with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material concerned and the affected cells being germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary, and other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit nature areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
On the spot one can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to photography and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people go from small villages by car to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this huge carbon economy has no longer allowed the biosphere to be in a stable state, enabling human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries problems with water quality or falling bridges are rare in comparison.
Why is there so many complaints in transport systems, why is it going wrong daily? Are transport technicians simply inadequate? Or is it something more fundamental?
In the case of a traffic flow, the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points shall be considered and the interactions between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictable, which means that traffic flows have some consistency and that something can be said about this mathematically.
Links have been established between the three core characteristics to better reflect traffic resolution: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road construction facilities.
Insects began to fly as first animals. Thanks to their flight ability, they were able to find easier escapes from enemies and more efficient food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places for predators.
At present, only dragonflies can't collapse their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and longest river and transports more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and in some places has a width of six miles.
At least 20% of all the water flowing into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building stone pyramids continued to the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, who had been over a thousand years old.
There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population number.
It is the Italian language for official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most widely spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to anoint them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that all consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know about the four conditions of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they are going into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are included in the metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend for many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has decreased in status as newer writing methods have occurred and is used much less.
Today, messages are written on a computer screen without ever needing a point sharpener.
You can ask yourself what's going to happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes into the market.
The atom bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
As if you're pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and if the core is split up again, a part of the energy comes out.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at least or least.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the high plains.
There may be more marks on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could easily come to the surface there.
Content theories are aimed at discovering what moves people and what they address.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories, they want to examine the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors they influence to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are the need pyramid of Maslow and the Motivation Hygiene theory of Hertzberg.
In general, there are two ways of dealing when managers are going to lead their former colleagues, and in one way they are trying to act as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to take unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, to hold evaluation talks, to delegate and to address people's responsibilities.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms itself into an unmistakable individual. He or she gets the feeling of having to change everything the team has done up to now, and wants to make everything his own.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards in terms of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first contact point for their direct physical group.
Often they are more self-employed than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why should an organisation start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals for the implementation of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity are highlighted if all available resources are effectively used within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result of this is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organisation, management must stimulate a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with an approach based on the continuous model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the examination of cognition, which allows the research area to be reduced and more accurate data collected.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, traumas, wounds and tumours can affect behavior and can lead to changes in mental ability.
As there are more and more new technologies, we are getting to know more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This offers us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI reminds most people immediately of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks for which intelligent behaviour is required is under investigation for AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the possibility to answer diagnostics and customer questions and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this system for artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
A lot of excursions are planned for each class. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, to look inside an aquarium or to see beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their journey to the capital of the state, which is redesigned each year and of which earlier versions are kept online to serve as a recordbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but changes this quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve writing and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging ' students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
With good use, blogs can 'help students to develop analyticalally and to think critically; by actively discussing the Internet, students can take their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara waterfalls. In the north you will find the beautiful unspoiled Muskoka and more.
These things make Ontario typical Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Farther north, large areas are relatively sparsely populated, and part of these areas is even almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the field of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are linked to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also took the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, which was the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and north by the Sahel region.
Women: Women travellers are advised to say that they are married, whether or not they are true.
It also helps to make rings (not too pricey looking rings).
Women must take into account that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is customary to be followed, to be taken to the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and do not be afraid to stand your male (cultural differences do not speak well!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berberse fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish merchants who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan stuff, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other habes, but it is pure for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the spitting of the Nyiragongo volcano lava, and the city's streets, in particular the city centre, were under control.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma you have to check the state of affairs regarding the fighting going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the most affordable trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move to Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timebooktoe' is relatively poorly accessible and is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today Timbuktu is a pauped city, although the reputation of the city makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered world heritage because of desert storms.
It was one of the most important stops of the PBS exhibition Special marvels from Henry Louis Gates' African world.
The city is different from the other cities in the country because it has a more Arab look than an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs in the east along the border with Mozambique, in the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometres tall, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various species of wild animals are kept.
As an important attraction in South Africa, this park is the paradise of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily maintenance fees and access costs apply.
It may also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is considered by many tourists as the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up Hong Kong skyline is already compared to a glistening bar graph that becomes visible thanks to Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong you leave the island and head towards the water side of Kowloon across the island.
The vast majority of the Hong Kong island population lives very close to each other on winning land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists have settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, you can start right here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world, stretching from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengali interiors.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The section within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps — they also have a few of the last powerful pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans have a surface area of 3,850 km2, a third of which is peat and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a game reserve since 1966 and in the area are now estimated to be 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses leave the station on the border of the districts ( opposite the river). Most of them leave between 6.30 and 7.30 hours, especially in the direction of the east and Jakarta/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the regional buses are often booked.
In most districts, small Japanese Coaster buses drive that are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that runs across the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passageways with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge is the crossing height 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it was only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge is fully operational in September 2017, and the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most striking indigenous group. They lived in the region that is now East Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sufficiency farming.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, found their food by hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly called the great province of India, arose in the 16th century when Spanish colonists met the indigenous population.
A three-century colonization period followed among the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has been able to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December the largest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
There are also smaller tournaments and competitions here at other times in the year.
Check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for plowed matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). The value is about one British pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, in Stanley opposite the store FIC West. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted all over the islands and in Stanley you can also pay often with credit cards and American dollars.
In the remote islands, you probably can't pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance how to pay.
Change your money again before you leave the islands, because Falklandian currency is very difficult to exchange.
Montevideo is below the equator, so if it's summer, it's winter on the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropicals. In the summer months temperatures exceed +30°C.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind in combination with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains roughly the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but eventually wild animals are just wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep in the park at least 100 metres from bears and wolves, and 25 metres from all other wild animals.
Elands, bisons, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
Every year dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep an appropriate distance. These animals are big, wild and possibly dangerous, so they give up the space.
In addition, you should be aware of the fact that smells of bears and other wild animals attract, so avoid carrying or cooking scenting food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city of almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850, Apia was founded and it is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Great Britain did not want to leave the port, which later came to be known as the notorious pastry.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the Mau movement's independence struggle, the highest leader, Tupua Tamase Lealofi III, was killed at a non-violent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district extend from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where safe swimming can be done and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's port, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes busy and have on the coast a good offer of shops. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer has the name 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can simply be drunk safely, but bottled water is also easy to find if you do not trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are trips to the reef all year round and injuries resulting from these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube walls occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town or 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
Sharks do happen, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of people and would just swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they normally do not live in the ocean.
Pre-booking ensures peace of mind with the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can mostly book other accommodation forms via a travel agency, such as a campsite place.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold you reservation if you want to think a little longer about the offer or if you have to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so via the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those present at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you must be early to obtain a campsite near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main podia has ended, other parts of the festival site may be played until the late hours of music.
For families whose children are still young, there are special campsites at some festivals.
Watch your cabin when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise if you're too close.
Cruises to Sint-Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually engage in getting the most out of time and the money that guests spend. Frames and clocks are normally not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have special offers in the field of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, they are affected by the fact that they are able to judge and all gamblers are aware that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go high into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, take into account that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be enormously low.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little frustration and it runs differently from asphalt.
During snowstorms, snow can fall enough in a very short period of time to get stuck.
It can also be hindered by falling or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic.
The largest tourist attraction in Africa is safari, which is the highlight of their journey for many visitors.
The concept of safari refers in popular use to land travel to see the beautiful African wild animals, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a standard equipment makes a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, chetas and leopards, you need a binocular.
A walk safari (also called a forest walk or walk safari) means you walk for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some parts are played in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games took place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay has been announced, you can be in a penable situation.
Cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March the majority of coronavirus based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
It is expected that most of the tickets for events will cost between 2500 and 130,000. Normal tickets will cost around 17,000.
You can dry moist clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have a iron and ironing board available. You can borrow these items often, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear covered socks, you can also use a hairdryer if available.
Make sure that the substance does not become too hot (this allows the substance to shrink or, in extreme cases, to heat up).
You can clean water in different ways. Some ways are effective to counter specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to cook water for a minute, and in other areas water must be boiled for a few minutes.
Not every filter is just as effective. In case of doubt you can drink the best water from a closed bottle of a reliable company.
Travellers may be faced with animal plagues that are not present in their own country.
Pesticides can spoil food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from tax and excise duty.
Travellers who go to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a lot of money, when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through a secluded trail and that makes this route one major challenge.
You're not used to driving on country roads? Then keep your head on it. You'll find a lot of steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp turns.
The maximum speeds set are significantly lower than in earlier and successive areas — usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important here to stick to it than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have much more range here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry tastes fine and in Bavaria the pastry is quite rich and varied, just like the pastry of the southern neighbor, Austria.

If a rider is thrown off a horse but continues to hang with his foot in the barge, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders first wear boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, have safety shackles, which allows a riser to get rid of the saddle if this is pulled backward because a rider of the horse falls.
