One experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola deaths, but so far no drugs are clearly suitable for the treatment of existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, was initially promising in the field, but official studies showed that it had fewer benefits than it wanted in preventing people from dying.
ZMapp was a control in the PALM trial, so scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to this.
The U.S. Olympic Committee has the support of U.S. Gymnastics and understands that it is necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.
We adhere to the USOC’s statement that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to make meaningful changes to our organization rather than taking down certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent study that can provide more clarity on how abuse on this scale, so courageously described by the victims of Larry Nassar, could remain unnoticed for so long, and embraces all necessary and applicable changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to ensure that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and powerful environment through sporting turns and making other sports as safe as possible.

This proves not only the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the lining of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The finding also gives insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as retractions.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to regulate the temperature or how it looked. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen shows adult feathers and not the dowry of a chicken.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample had the feathers of an adult and not the donuts of a chick.

The completed work was primarily theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on Earth, which leads to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is around, in a kind of circle, and consists of a large amount of smaller particles.

What is consistent is that deep holes in the ground are," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Fla.
In France, voting hardly requires technology: voters enter a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that says which candidate they vote for.
Officials first check the identity of the elector, then the elector slides the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot box.
The process is relatively tightly enshrined in France’s electoral law.
Votes must be transparent since 1988 so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In the other match she took part in, the sitting Grand Slalom, she became tenth of the ladies, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi who finished as Dani.
Four skiers from the women’s group for the sitting slalom were unable to finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to place themselves during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya, five of the Swedish woman’s rapists have been arrested and found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending the prosecution and trial, but the eyewitness report may have been implied because her story has been published frequently.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos of suspects and so on.”
Crown Office has the overall management of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are made.
According to sources, the document refers to a settlement of disputes, something the Palestinians wanted on the basis of the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a holy city for both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years following the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only prepared for a five-year presence.
The shooters in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by foresters, which was followed up and their effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation had extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a nine-headed new provisional electoral council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the previous National Electoral Council, which is part of a package of measures to bring new elections to the country.
The commission was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests stemmed from the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious."
"Very regrettable," the ministry's response to the fact that Apple has postponed the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Office for Disaster Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage was reported nationally.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been taken to safety and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were previously released, including children and the elderly, and Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot down.
Liggins went to work in medicine and followed the example of his father.
Trained as a midwife, he went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins did research on early birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua said government investigators found two "black boxes" with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Co-wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Just as unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels stated that "Luna was just as weird as me... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Resignation Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the government of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of the participants in this poll supported this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last prince of Australia.
29% of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31% said that should never happen.
The Olympic gold medal winner swam the 100- and 200-metre freestyle and three relay matches during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question because of his complaints.
He could not take the medications he needed to alleviate his pain because they were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number currently known on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery at the beginning of February using different hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water that came to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to be able to gain insight into the way planets are formed. They especially want to know how the Earth was formed, given the fact that it has been a long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He called the gossips "political nonsense and gossip."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes, according to the FAA, which could save millions of tons of fuel a year for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies with ground radars, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and they can provide pilots with clearer information.
There is no extra transport and there are no aboveground trains at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on site.
A possible lack of transport increased the chances that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process lasted much longer because of the crossing of a native Darwin fin, the Middle fin, with an immigrated Cactus fin.
Gold can be processed into many shapes. It can be rolled up into small shapes.
It can be drawn in a narrow wire that can be turned and braided. It can also be forged or rolled in plates.
After it is made very thin, it can be glued to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'lighted manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You already make an indicator using red charcoal juice.
Then the color of the charcoal juice changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
Based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical, the pH value is indicated.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet that was connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, there were toilets in ancient China, Egypt and Persia, such as toilets in Roman times were often part of a people's bathhouse, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is sent back immediately.
The satellite has been shot into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's steam circuit distorts some of our light and image.
To power a satellite or telescope in space, you need to have a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing that the wheel has given us is an easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are catfish of average size between the prey of medium-sized food, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as stray cats that are kept as pets) that hunt large numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, hedgehogs and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has so that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are family of each other and also have up to thirty females and puppies.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that look surprisingly much like lions (but not like other large catfish), and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and have five times as much traction as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar with full power like a lion. It's more like he's roaring a whole sentence.
The favorite meal of ocelots are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds like that. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively on animals that are much smaller than he is himself.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their odor ability to hunt small animals (their prey), by smelling on the ground where they have been.
By night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very unobtrusively. Ocelots hunt prey by making themselves one with the surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) releases from the large population from which they originate (for example, by moving over a mountain chain or river, or if they are moved to another island, from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, other raw materials and other enemies are present, so the new population must start to prepare themselves differently or adapt to cope with competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants extract their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our houses and clothing are made of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain from that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws had more than 70 sticky teeth, plus an extra set in the sky, meaning nothing or nobody could escape him.
It is not certain, but it was possible that his tongue was forged. It ate turtles, large fish, other mossaurians and maybe even his own kindred.
In waters, nothing was safe from the attacks; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were not a party to him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual delicacies, including guinea pigs, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to hold a banquet together where they lay on their sides while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain food that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods; this temple was seen as the god’s own home.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a backyard that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes as part of the temples towers were built in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan and therefore timber was enormously expensive.
According to Norwegian legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on its way to the west and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, the individuals, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
After the film National Treasure, you might think that there is a treasure map behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is based on a misconception. There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original U.S. Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776'. The text is at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (from 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inch to 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inch) was rolled up for storage earlier.
It seems, therefore, that the designation has simply been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the fighting that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were the French who scuttled on the side of the Germans in 1940 and thus fought with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded South France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France within just two weeks, after which they set out for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilisation, which means civil, comes the term civilisation, related to the Latin civis, which then stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state; and that also defines in a certain way the size of society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a balanced spread.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the articles of the Confederacy formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
The Congress lacked the power to raise taxes because there was no national executive or judiciary power and relied on state authorities to enforce all decisions that often did not want to cooperate.
It also did not have the authority to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
At first, all states had to agree unanimously with the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest island), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often geographically referred to as a 'shelf island'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe drove along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself as a base in southwestern Taiwan, where the VOC approached the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, in which sovereignty over Taiwan was transferred to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Built of three major structures, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better picture of what they looked like before.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the renovation is still underway.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format at the end of the analog film era.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The image ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would in that case be 3:2.
Many common layouts (for example, APS-like layouts) are equal to or a close approach to this image ratio.
The third-party rule, which is widely abused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic and yet also clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, so you divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was on fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite language differences and differences in customs.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-pervading power had an impact on everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth must be used to fight suffering and poverty, and the church has funds available for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this ratio of power and money led to many people beginning to doubt whether this principle was being followed.
Britain launched a blockade at sea against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy turned out to be effective because it was no longer possible to provide vital supplies to military and civilians, but this blockade took away the generally accepted international law that was enshrined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters so that ships could no longer sail in entire parts of the ocean, which was even dangerous for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country’s unarmed undersea warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a close-up and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinct dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, this took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
At that time there were fierce wars between various nobles fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest to book. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the country belongs to its inhabitants instead of a single leader.
For all male applicants, post-revolution positions were available so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the army. The army ranks are no longer based on someone's class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class to revolution in other countries.
He often went for meditation to a cave that later became known as the Hira Cave in the Noer Mountains, where he was a member of the group.
The cave itself, which has endured the tooth of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Mohammed.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not at all easy to find. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful air and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of the numerous large pyramid structures in honor of a late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Gizeh Pyramids' in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the large sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a nucleus or square missing the bottom of it.
Above means you have to start at the point and push the iron rod away. Below means you have to start at the archer (the place where your hand holds the iron rod) and pull the iron rod.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal characters, but remember that the printed strings are there for a musical reason, so they usually need to be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a group of market women sat behind the departure of the dreaded Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They returned to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by jolly and threatening packets that threatened the King and Queen.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, someone in the crowd held the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles up in front of the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in connection with the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the population of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street on behalf of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested largely on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars one must know what was the context that gave rise to the formation of the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human fate is driven by an underlying logic that is linked to scientific laws and its appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a trajectory that largely extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ‘effects’ on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, which is why new production methods are being developed so that the cost of car ownership can be reduced.
Massive car ownership also causes a greater number of accidents on the road and this leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care in order to restore the human body.
Romanticism included a large part of cultural determinism, which was derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography formed the individual, and over time, customs and cultures arose as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than the laws imposed by arbitrary means.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It stood from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD known as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital of Constantinople.
The Gothic celebrated its high days in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the West were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture in which enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of life support is a simple system that is usually organic. It uses stored seeds that come from the ecoregion, and that is combined with changing crops or other relatively simple techniques to optimize the yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sustaining agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded people who feel neglected are brought together by social norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of societalization was the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, misconduct, or wilful abuse during adulthood.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the child's severe mental or physical limitations.
Non-negotiable children may have experienced serious child abuse or serious trauma before they were abandoned or before they left.
Others are said to have been brought up by animals, and some are said to have lived only in the wilderness.
A stray child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior that resembles the behavior of the animal that the child has cared for (within the physical limits), such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, for example, a teacher is a form of support, but Microsoft Office’s paper clipboard is that too.
There is virtual scaffolding that is built into the software that asks questions, offers memory backups, and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons why children get into foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they don’t care and where they can’t develop, but it does happen.
We consider the care system a safe zone for these children.
It is intended that nursing care ensures a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In nursing care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the Internet, parts of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as “personal involvement” and “persistent relationships” when they investigated public responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by paying attention only to micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President’s Speech how it is possible for people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage to accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, it is varied through separation and recombination between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system that resembles that of man on the savannah but can hardly get the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found there.
Furthermore, it cannot take into account serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition and eventually even death.
The easiest to find plant sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (bees, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our ancestors solve their “protein problem” in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall asleep again within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without waking up at once.
If you put your watch out in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way you have to get out of your bed to turn it out.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of fluid before going to bed (and then especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic).
The amount of inner calm that a person has is compared to the amount of stress that a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Each person is able to achieve satisfaction and total rest.
Everyone can lighten his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teachings of Buddhism. However, this form of Buddhism is extended with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and an imitation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (energy of enlightenment) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, cooperation was established between the USSR and the US. When the war was over, the conflicts between the system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies faced each other two years after the end of the war, which was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and fighting with proxy fighters took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence forces only held it until 17 September 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
These plans, however, were thwarted in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in conflict with the Peace of Riga, the multi-national and other Soviet-Polish counter-attack.
Freight transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the navy to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The U.S. tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean from the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII, this is one of the most notable recent examples.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic using mainly submarines.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain had probably fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the little ones were domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran for the first time some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to hold them so that they could always easily get to her, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grassland. They were then guarded by goat keepers, like the more familiar shepherd often a child or younger. Today, it is still kept in the same way.
As early as the 16th century, horse-drawn carriages were built in England.
Although horse-drawn carriageways consisted only of a rail of shelves, the horses had to walk more and more quickly and produce larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Crossbars were used early enough to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron dot on the top.
This quickly became the common practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were installed.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking straight two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) came up.
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, ran less often.
In fossils of the Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, two-legged specializations are found. The Sahelanthropus, by the way, may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, join an environmental movement, or even take action to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, it is just like a symptomatic treatment. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and get them out of the way.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly changed the earth drastically, and overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away, signed by Continental Congress President John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, these are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon held the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July and read to his troops in New York on 9 July, and another one arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap flyers are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still make you think of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and shovels, laying eggs and walking on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulation of data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately clear. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific EHBO instructions for that exact poison.
This group of insects is formally called "wants" by entomologists.
This term comes from a centuries-old agreement with bedbugs, which are insects that can very well parasitize on humans.
Both red predators and bed bugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in their host's nest or house.
In the U.S., there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological condition in both younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to give up their baby for adoption.
When adopting, parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
Yet it is more than just a trial; a trial is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, to place question marks, and to make observations, as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek diminished.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-providing oscillators that go through a cycle for a certain period of time, even if there are no external signals for this.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was marked with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are kiemic balances.
Only mutations in chemistry are hereditary, and other mutations can cause cells to die or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site, you can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people from small villages take the car to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village where they just come from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in touch with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this enormous carbon economy no longer makes the biosphere in a stable state, allowing human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsed bridges are relatively rare.
Why do so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong on a daily basis? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behaved reasonably predictable, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said here in the mathematical field.
Connections have been made between the three core properties to better reflect traffic handling: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
With the help of these relationships, the planning, design and operation of road engineering facilities is facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape enemies and find more efficient food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a larger number of small places for predators.
At the moment, only lizards and Mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the earth, and the sun as well (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and on a second longest river and transports more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
Almost 20% of all the water that flows through the rivers into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long, with water coming from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza remain unmatched in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then more than a thousand years old.
About 800 people live in Vatican City, the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the main language for the official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most widely spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper from antiquity, because they are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to delve into them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he has also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there are a trillion atoms in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful friend for many people when it was launched.
The pen is unfortunately reduced in status as newer writing methods have emerged and is used much less.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a point grinder.
You can ask yourself what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes out on the market.
The atomic bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like you're pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core is broken up again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall at least or least apart.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marshes on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could more easily come to the surface there.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow older.
With these theories, they want to investigate the reasons why certain people want to have certain things and what environmental factors they influence to do certain things well or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need pyramid and Hertzberg's Motivation-Hygiene theory.
In general, there are two trading methods that come up when managers start giving guidance about their former colleagues. In one trading method, they try to set themselves up as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate and address people on their responsibilities.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she gets the feeling of having to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards in terms of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly ‘invisible team’ (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity come to light when all available resources are effectively deployed within the functional departments of an organization.
The result is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organization, management must foster a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with a continuum model approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This allows the area of research to be narrowed and more accurate data can be collected.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As there are more and more new technologies, we are becoming more and more aware of the structures and processes in the brain.
This gives us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that allow us to gain more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI makes most people immediately think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The development of machines to automate tasks for which intelligent behavior is required is under investigation of AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students to view the artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a great way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and whose earlier versions are kept online to serve as placards.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often, their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve writing and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging 'students are also being forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning to far beyond the traditional school day.
With good use, blogs can "help students to develop analytically and critically; by actively engaging in discussion on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls, in the north you will find the beautiful untouched Muskoka and more.
This sort of thing makes Ontario in the eyes of outsiders typical Canadian.
Further north, large areas are fairly sparsely populated and part of these areas is even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the field of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also took with them the Islamic faith, after which it spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the hijacking route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north by the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether this is true or not.
It also helps to make rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should keep in mind that cultural differences can lead to behavior they see as intimidating and that it is customary to be followed, caught in the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don’t be afraid to stand your man (cultural differences don’t speak well!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, after an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish merchants who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other hats, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the Far East.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano spraying lava and became dormant most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside of Goma you should check the state of affairs regarding the fighting going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the most inexpensive trips for mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move to Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbook' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Today, Timboektoe is a ruined city, although the city’s reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS exhibition Special Miracles from the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab appearance than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs to the east along the border with Mozambique, to the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
19,500 square kilometers is the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wildlife species are kept.
As an important attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade horse of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily maintenance fees and access fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and that is considered by many tourists as the main place.
The large number of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has already been compared to a shimmering bar graph that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close together on conquered land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists have settled, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, then you can start right here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengali inland.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps — they also feature some of the last powerful pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is grassland and swampland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and there are now an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Axis herders in the area.
During the day there are buses departing from the station at the border of the districts (against the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30 hours, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, because the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses are comfortable and sturdy.
With shared taxis one can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guiana city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge is the pass height of 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 and the Brazilian customs offices are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area now East Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in self-sufficient agriculture.
In the province of Chaco, other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, lived, who found their food by hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly known as "the great province of India", was founded in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous people.
There followed a three-century period of colonization among the Spaniards.
Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
There are also smaller tournaments and competitions at other times of the year.
Check the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP). The value is about one British Pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
In the remote islands, you will probably not be able to pay with a credit card, but probably with the UK and US currency. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Exchange your money again before you leave the islands, because Falkland currencies are very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it’s summer there, it’s winter on the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures are calmly higher than <0x2B>30<0xC2><0xB0>C.
The winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains roughly the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately just wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep in the park at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
Elephants, bison, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they look.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom did not want to leave the port, which later became known as the infamous patting.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, came to an outgoing nonviolent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Great Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's Port, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer has the name 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can simply be drunk safely, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don’t trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate milk is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are all year round trips to the reef and injuries due to these trips to the reef are rare.
However, ask for expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube whales occur from October to April near beaches and river monasteries north of Town or 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans. Most of the sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the mouth of the river north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodation forms, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also keep you reservation if you want to think a little longer about the offer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or wish to make a change, you must do so through the travel agent instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on the spot and most visitors see this as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to acquire a camping spot near the music.
And remember this: even if the music on the main stage is over, music may be played on other parts of the festival grounds until the late hours.
For families whose children are still young, there are special campgrounds at some festivals.
Pay close attention to where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise. if you are too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from the visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually strive to get the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and bells are normally not present and the output is sometimes difficult to find.
They have normally spoken of special offers in the area of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, that affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it is hugely important to stay sober.
If you go into the mountains high up or drive over mountain passes, you have to keep in mind that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently than asphalt.
During snowstorms, there can be enough snow to get stuck in a very short period of time.
It can also be impeded by falling or exploding snow or because of condensation or ice on the vehicle’s windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and traffic is not impeded here.
The biggest tourist attractions in Africa are safaris, which for many visitors are the highlight of their trip.
The term safari refers in popular use to trips over land to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need a remote viewer, otherwise the chances are small that you will see them.
A walking safari (also called a ‘forest walk’ or ‘walk safari’) means that you walk several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics will run from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some parts will be played at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games have been held twice, the first time in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000. Normal tickets cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear stretch socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, screw up).
You can purify water in different ways. Some ways are effective to counteract specific risks.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas it is necessary to boil water for a few minutes.
Not every filter is as effective. In case of doubt, you can drink the best water from a closed bottle from a reliable company.
Travellers may be faced with animal plagues that do not exist in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from tax and excise duties.
Travelers who go to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through abandoned terrain and that makes this route one big challenge.
Are you not used to driving on road trips? Keep your head up. You will encounter many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp corners.
The set maximum speeds are noticeably lower than in previous and consecutive areas — usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and here it is even more important to stick to them than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have a lot more reach here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cake tastes good and in Bavaria the cake is reasonably rich and varied, just like the cake of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You will see a lot of fruit cakes. All year round, the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste great at a cup of strong coffee.

The Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching concept for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without further information, the term refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is available today throughout the archipelago and offers several simple herbal dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Steering hooks support the rider’s feet and hang downwards on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but they can also cause safety problems because the rider’s feet can get stuck in it.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but continues to hang with the foot in the climbing hook, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders first wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, have safety brackets. This allows a climbing bulge to get rid of the saddle if it is pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile. This is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock walls that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports where you go downhill, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slid down on a snow-covered downhill with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many lovers, who sometimes are also called 'ski bums', who plan whole holidays around skiing at a certain location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, skiing or skiing.
It’s not exactly the same, but it looks like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You will need a lot more rugged skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a walking route.
In good conditions, you can walk longer distances than walking, but it is rare for you to reach the speed of long-distance runs without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for a visa several times and undergo passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions in this area almost as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport check again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antique. Some tax offices give goods older than 100 years the definition of antique.
In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to label artisanal products as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass products.
Among the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi, keeping reindeer is an important form of life support. Also, the culture around trade is very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi were involved in large-scale reindeer farming. They entertained themselves with fishing, hunting and such things. Here reindeer were usually used as pulling animals.
Many S<0xC3><0xA1>mi work today in modern professions. In S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi area is tourism is an important source of income.

If a travel advice applies to the country you want to travel to, this can have consequences for your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is aimed at their own residents.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may be faced with situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions contain only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a volatile, general and extremely simplistic image compared to other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption, or the loss of human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Appearances and consequences of severe weather include heavy winds, hail, large amounts of rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterfalls and hurricanes.
Snow storms, ice storms and dust storms are among other examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks that severe weather conditions in their surroundings entail, as these may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be trained professionally.
A search for 'course in hostile environments' on the internet will probably give you the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues outlined here are normally discussed in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing games, a lot of EHBO and occasionally gun training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the proper documentation for the return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to provide passports on which no gender (X) is mentioned, or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Furthermore, searches at the security checks have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery may assume that they do not come through this scan with undamaged privacy and dignity.
Mui currents are the recurrent flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return stream is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths fall as a result of fatigue by trying to swim against the current, which could simply be impossible.
When you have escaped from the strong current, swimming back is so pissed.
Try to focus on a place where you will not be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you are noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a lesser ‘marriage feeling’), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes find it hard to adapt to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and returned thereafter, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits from your own culture.
Earlier when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
Usually, it is not expected that patience and understanding is needed for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You will see the pyramids in the dark and you will see them in silence before the show begins.
Often the sound of sellers and tourists is always audible here. The story of the light and sound is similar to that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception, where you’ll find the full-fledged crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, on the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula’s mountains cross into the plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations where there is no reception for mobile phones.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to stand outside with free view of the satellite in order to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can give you more information about how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people who are planning an interim year to travel and learn.
In particular, school leavers use this to take an interim year before university without adverse consequences for their education.
Often, enrolling for a degree abroad during an interim year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, college fees must be paid for enrollment for these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination to sail. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time, that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
For example, you can spend a few full days in the historic place and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only board a boat trip.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s just a lot of fear that other people have too.
If you know how planes work, this can help to remove a fear that arises from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
courier companies get a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, goods or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they ship things by air, it may take days for some routes to unload and get through customs.
Only if checked-in baggage could it be processed faster. According to the rules of the airlines, there must be an associated passenger and so are you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is by counting down a bag of money for this privilege (or better yet, by letting your employer do this).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
It usually doesn’t make sense to look for discounts for business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to count down a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable, and the airlines therefore charge appropriate costs for this.
Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u is the capital of Moldova, where the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but also the Russian language is very common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was plagued by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the United Nations.
Economic ties have re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in the Republic of Moldova.

Ordinary announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, ruthless and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can’t hurt to present your best foot in Paris and behave like someone who is ‘been elevated’ (well educated). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard outside of the Parisians disappears quickly when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech trees, sparren and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are particularly many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil species and the varying heights.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the eagle, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt over their knees and should be covered with shoulders.
You will usually get a wrapping cloth as a woman if you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you take your own copy, with delicious shrieking colors, the monk or nun who stands at the entrance will kindly welcome you.
On the other hand, men should wear trousers to a minimum above the knees.
You can also borrow them from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time after the end, so you may not feel comfortable with them. One size fits all for men!

A simple and popular dish for dinners, mainly during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever else is available to tasters, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Independent nouns, like you what you mean, always have a capital letter at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
In this way, you make a first name difference between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a standalone noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so the pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You have to pay most attention to the c and the g. Their pronunciation depends on the sound that follows.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means love, while caro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will teach you a lot about the grammar of Persian and will help you to ponder sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese here seems so much that you don’t have to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories have been neglected nowadays, and serve as museums or educational sights.
Light pollution was not as big a problem at the time as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, better accessible than today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the view of cherry blossom and this has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that is where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you need to suppress the tendency to remove even 'only one' species.
When you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be denied access to the garden immediately and without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the ‘high tropics’, but a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and powerful sun (when the sky is clear, this is less common).

Check to see if the bus you take Hebron is really going in and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, where the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Moreover, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians all over the world have adopted many traditions that belong to the holiday.
There is a tradition in which you stay the whole Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter wake is often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where the congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands have come here by swimming, flying or swimming.
Due to the long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the trip, making the giant turtle the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night takes place in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
