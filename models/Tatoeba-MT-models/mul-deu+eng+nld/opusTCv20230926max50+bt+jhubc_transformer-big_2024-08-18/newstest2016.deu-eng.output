Obama has welcomed Netanyahu.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises Israel’s ongoing settlement build-up and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
Obama’s proposed deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, which was partly deemed an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting had been rejected by him with reference to his upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a somewhat quoting voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his “sweet dog” was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was critiqued on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could make it go back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who was under the sign and he was the one who ever loved me."
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he had a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, knocked on the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that Lamb made the penitentiary emergency call sometime after.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police intercepted him.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and lecturers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprised 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a bit excited and nervous "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a bachelor’s degree for health reasons, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he re-entered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent’s home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education.
He graduated in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar for a few years.
He was the women's warmth at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there,” said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
“She was totally destroyed on the ground,” O’Stein said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 after Lamb ended his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There were no indications that something was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the late professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial service, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will be resumed on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to move our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss, although there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says it will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed at it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, while another 45,000 workers were hired during the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film, Back in Time.
The film begins, and I think I’m a simulated gait and an arm length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "undisputedly the biggest time travel film ever made."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only make violence and misery worse for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the Council’s five permanent member nations – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – on the sidelines of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers “make this situation insoluble.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in dealing with the crisis in Syria in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll scores that show that Donald Trump is being taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others took it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some are starting to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of the real estate mogul’s nomination.
Of course, it is too early in the election.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership was given to the ascendant Herman Cain, none of whom even won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s persistence and begin to let their dollars flow to smash him.
Here are some current survey scores that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul as positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were to be nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “angry” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, were the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is true in the nation’s first landmark state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, Quinnipiac said last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans get used to the idea.
If they put on their scholarly guard, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet after a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That’s a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ballot in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is distributed diffusely to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly cast their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapist" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in public discourse as of 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic way of expressing crucial Hispanic Americans will be kept away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now lack about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsourcing status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday poll that they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "very angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea Wad.
On the street, one square metre of a reet roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," the study says - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student bid in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top residences, however, one of the prices is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residences - with prices per square metre at dwindling heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, well-marked.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of the list.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A happy hit from Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Witch's Chest of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52/90<0x2B>2) and Götzes hit (89.) earning 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth success in the series is expected to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally bring the handle to Munich in the third round.
Müller received good help from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto on his 28th match in the Champions League to lead Bayern, which allowed a shot of the world champion to pass.
“We won’t underestimate them,” Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised ahead of the game at the Karaiskakis stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooming fans – and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed notion without glittering.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also came out.
But the Bavarians, unbeaten in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely ran to work in their offensive efforts, but often to be impeccable.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift on left-handed Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right hemisphere in the left upper gate.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion gave the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best chances in half one.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideae Brown hit Poland's header from the line (26.).
Then by direct shot, the goalkeeper paired Roberto with his knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to play the dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needle stitches.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, however, was abandoned.
For example, when he steered a shot of ideas over the latte (56.).
Recently Guardiola had a four-chain defender with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the frame, sat outside first.
The World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training, sports manager Matthias Sammer told "Sky": "Anyone who wants to make something else out of it, that's already evil".
Also on the first shift Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and 13 minutes later made everything clear, Müller put another one on by eleven meters.
Before the game, there were clashes in the stadium.
After a small group of partially mutilated Bavarian fans apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus in their spectator block with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and marched against the Munich supporters with strike sticks.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this is according to a Potsdamer long-term study.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk goes down quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evidenced by the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5 to 3.6 times higher risk of prematurely losing their teeth.
The researchers had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and tooth loss is due to more frequent inflammation of the gums in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take over ten years for the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIFE: "Smoking shortens life."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIFE said.
Previous research would have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from the Late Antiquity at Cologne River
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called floor monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological monument maintenance.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, archaeologists have now been found.
It was already known from text documents that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman is unlucky at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at about 1.40 am, the woman from the direction of the station building coming at the end of the railway staircase crossed the track and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By detecting the train, according to the Federal Police, she suffered the most serious injuries from it.
She was treated for medical treatment on the spot and was taken to a hospital by rescuers.
There is no information available to the investigating officer about the reason for the nightly crossing of the railways of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have learned acoustic perceptions.
Inquiry come residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Indications about the cause of the accident can be given at the 24-hour and free-of-charge hotline of the Federal Police at 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in TTIP dispute
To exacerbate the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitral tribunal system.
Accordingly, the disputed private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds significantly to more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government has announced its support.
TTIP is the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the same parts of the EU, the US and from third countries.
A second instance is also planned for the first time.
It would allow it to raise an objection to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work for an International Investment Court, according to her own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be resolved.
The Investor-State Arbitration Procedures (ISDS) demanded mainly by large corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitral tribunals are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can dispute damages at the expense of taxpayers, repeal national laws, or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In its initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact called the Commission's proposals inadequate.
It was criticised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German Economy Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account the essential points that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring in the reform.
The old system of private arbitral tribunals was from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the opportunities of complaints to the economy by way of too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
Whether the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) can be concluded remains unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, there should be a framework for the agreement by the end of this year.
This date is considered no longer sustainable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost caught up with Steven’s talk.
He tells stories based on different places, which he repeatedly records on the map, about which his minutiously and delicately arranged songs tell.
Where they were born and how it looks there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderful creative fool.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that harmoniously blend very close to the American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into great opulence at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a forged series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sacked in succession.
But already in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reducing Stevens' performance here.
Live enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois"), a masterpiece was released in 2005.
Overloaded with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album climbs into the American Billboard charts and is not missing from any of the year’s best influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic spare parts on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and hall.
Along with the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon star bands and large fluorescent stage encoding.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens tours Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark hamburger More!
He is currently presenting the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests now sit out in their chairs, the significantly more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play through the wide-enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus "throw away the plate basically".
First to add, Stevens thanks himself modestly, acoustically plays a few older songs, and finally denies himself with thousands of applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the prime minister's question time is expected with excitement
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at the prime minister’s hour of questioning and to start a relationship with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs closely.
He called for “less theater and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary hearing for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as she will be a member of the Shadow Cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national anthem’s singing at a commemoration celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention to himself.
A spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said he had "standed in respectful silence" and that he had acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independent” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn’s top team, calling for differences in economics, defense, and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also stacked within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn’s remarks on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing amendments to remove the whole idea of a restriction as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron, since he has been Tory’s boss, over the dispatch box in parliament over the past decade.
The Labour chairman, who has promised another policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s hour of questioning is too confrontational, and that he will stop both “fighting skills” and fighting with retaliation and has instead made the effort to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economics minister, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor and that he had addressed John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theater", which is often linked to the prime minister's questioning hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the prime minister’s questioning hour was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader’s verdict and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow parliamentarians, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': homeless teenagers trained as photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a cool hard place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound Rises Due to Accelerated Wage Growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply according to data showing an increase in wage growth in the UK, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and made estimates of the time of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and rose to 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a 20 % jump after receiving a takeover offer from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures matched all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – reported growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the miner said he had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt-cutting strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set his rating for the company's rating to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages endanger the expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a henfling with an oversized frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is spinning.
He knows Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the pole has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berliner Luxushotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: Here you live Idol, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If not at all.
She says, "Actually, my victoria should be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling her a dream."
Duty of school?
Wen juckt's?
Not the fans.
Not Bieber himself.
He's out anyway.
For the advertisements in the promotional break of the Superbowl, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company laundered many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And for every doll that looks like him and over the shopping table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a cup of coffee, you stand at the window.
More than 100 million is said to have been stolen.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida plaque brings Lebanese to potato field idea
Potatoes or doughnuts?
It goes both - in the potato field, developed by Oldenburger imbiss owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "Potatoes instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spoon.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, his shop has turned a grilled spice, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
“This is multiculture for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a use model.
As a result, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the spice contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash Launches Ground Resistance Campaign to Fight Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi uprising in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares for the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and event management, as well as e-marketing via social media.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and store owners selling leased tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler is conducting its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There’s a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will snatch around five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate revenues of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s turnover in the food and grocery business to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017, and by 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, resulting in operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and making a better choice for private customers.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to Australian tennis president Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is often referred to as the "Special Ks", came to light by Kyrgios’ infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati shortly thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, with Harrison exclaiming: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a spasm eluded a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was relentlessly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing that I'm pretty much up to about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was dragged into the dispute a little bit," Healy said.
He broke a beater when he lost due to a spasm in the U.S. Open, but he’s not the first player to break a beater out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and more mature young guy, and I think he deserves it.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man to return as a long-term solid component to the team."
“First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think that Nick very quickly managed the ascent, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He climbs in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism that he can get for it, but we're trying to support it for it, we're just trying to help him in it, we're trying to catch him
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and blocked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s-land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations have increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police.
Some reject food and water from protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy.
The ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in crowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take on a further 120,000 refugees, including some from the EU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damage to the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also set higher levels of prison sentences.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to formally approve the deployment of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, a state security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They get over it by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to penetrate there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, will receive support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates will support them.
But Clinton’s supporters are more persistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a major lead in women and moderates, but these lead have diminished.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton’s advantage over democratic voters under the age of 50 has fled, and she and Sanders are now on equal footing.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters in the pre-election polls nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republicans say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidency into the scales, 57 percent of Democratic voters want to see him in the run-up to the polls – even though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the forefront.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-fifty percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent in the past month.
Biden is by far a second on this measurement, but the percentage that considers him the "most selectable" has risen.
However, when asked what is more important about a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about the eligibility.
Like last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these constituents stands out as unacceptable in the pre-election.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on some of the important characteristics of voters in their party’s pre-election.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best cut off from the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think about him.
Democratic pre-election voters generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as ideologically consistent with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters in the pre-election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their views at all.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened even more.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month’s May, and 15 points less.
62% of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also view Trump as not being honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut the best in honesty.
A majority view Sanders as more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-election is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson backs up at nationwide poll close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now lack half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing hold.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, with support growing from 23% in the latest CBS poll conducted ahead of last month’s Fox News debate, to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, published last week, shows Carson’s rise in polls – landing with 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hues for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign run-in in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Although peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go into the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a Baruch college newling
Nearly two years after a student died during a schizophrenic ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York’s Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been loaded with eyes tied to a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to reach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache, then he died unconscious.
Members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, to get advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the welfare of the brotherhood basically above that of Michael Deng,” said Chief of Police Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly subjected to mute force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the fraternity's schizophrenia, with at least one student dying of the schizophrenia every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members need to be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with schizophrenic attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We don't just want to hold those involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - then we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates.
An increase in interest rates will come, and the rise will fluctuate, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long all this will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. central bank have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘fair money’,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month, anticipation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency that capital gains will be discarded 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” German bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market management is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates, quite flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to current gains at nuvets at a normal state of chess after 500 days.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the rise cycle and returns are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that it did not have before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the Fed’s interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question “whether it’s different this time around,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been looking for an interest rate hike from the Fed all year round, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing fluctuations in GDP and pre-recession highs very quickly after the onset of recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction once the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields falling closer between longer and shorter bonds, leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although “we’re still cautious about expecting higher returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded and volatility has increased – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from it as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet averaged 5 percentage points higher than firms with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percent) and 3 (percent).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings savers could see profits through higher returns, even if experts are of differing opinion on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MEP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the broadcaster for his "condemnation"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament, and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that private broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station is "dumbing" and increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like to use the word ‘damn’ — but it seems to turn into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else — these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you’re actually just mimicking what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC Director General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public enlightenment.
What I’m learning from Radio 3, I’m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music that’s really unrivalled.
“And Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needs to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for taking on commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he would like the company to "find a hit from our own home stable" if it launches an entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the payer for other entertainment formats.
Internet revenues rose the slowest in August, and Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month, there was the lowest result since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe that Black Friday slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000, with only a five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were intensifying three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that’s commuting in, and we’re probably going to see that growth is declining.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is cited as a reason for slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event, which will take place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average number of buyers swarmed around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers struggled over smuggling, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 expenses, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the city centre.
Muslims Bury Those Killed in Mecca Crane Accident - Bin Laden's Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse of some of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
The mourners, largely dressed in white, filled the track to pay their respects as the first of the dead embarked on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession took place at the Holy Place, where just days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beetles killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddh in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hadsch will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have left the crane’s arm standing when it was not in use.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crash of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddhish, which takes place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not make any statements about the collapse of de Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also taunted the group for not current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was kidnapped by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people were staying in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million Rial (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount of permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
As a result, another 200 screwfix stores targeting craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chef Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British are laying down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes.
If you can skilfully use a hammer or brush to slash walls, you seem to be a minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out homework jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the tree market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices has now been overhauled.
Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are predominant.
She said it was necessary to cope with the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this to a balance more strongly.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a leading British company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and chief financial officer.
Mrs. Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and revenues after the group shouldered the costs of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Regional Court of Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-chairman Aich/Dob had to be held responsible for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendants had crystallized that in the years 2006 to 2011, they used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was ruled out by the chairman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
The defence to the allegation of infidelity stated that at no time was there a property disadvantage to the association.
The sports officials had only compensated for the expenses and the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, derived from the debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (roughly 44,000 euros).
"At the time we faced the situation: shall we continue to lead the club or shall we close?" said one of the defendants, in the profession of large business auditor of the Finance Office.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We've put our life insurance in front of the bank," he said at the time of the acquisition.
It was agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, there can only be no debt made.
Furthermore, if financially appropriate, the reimbursement of the expenditure compensation was decided retroactively until 1991.
As a result, some of the expense compensation was paid out years later, that is, from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, there were also package and not detailed bookings, the former Obmann explained the operations.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the disbursements were not disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial reform, it was important that only the debt-free, according to the answer.
When one official began investigations into abuse of office in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
This was a rebuttal, the defendants said.
This securities account ran under the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
“Why?” asked the judge.
For a long time, the respondent did not know an answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damages".
Why damages?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because no damage had ever been done to the club.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "That's how you're all out of the cutter."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never paid a cent, he only paid mileage and diets.
On diets, he charged the club 1,000 euros per month, but the actual expenditure was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer stored after an operational inspection, in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second accused had also been charged with mileage.
All the repairs were made in cash, he had to drive from his residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the three-year staffing cuts, the computer giant will cut more jobs in the company’s breakdown.
Job postings at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer sector.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion) will be saved, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been underway for three years, has not yet been completed.
At the end of 2013/14, HP employed around 302,000 people.
Subsequently, the Hewlett-Packard stock declined 2.3 percent.
Palo Alto, California, is now splitting up with printers: this is how the computer and printer business should be consolidated into a new society – separate from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both shares are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo recently added.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Revenue fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
Revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job postings to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only lately responded to customers’ increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans provide for a total of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority Supports Anti-IS Training Mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in hostilities in Iraq would, however, be largely rejected: 54 percent opposed it, and 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other countries are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24% are against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is rejected by 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29% were not able to decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
At the center of the fair are connected, self-driving cars as well as electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days of press, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto “Connecting Mobility” on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA on Saturday.
The organizers of the car association VDA expect about 900,000 visitors as two years ago.
Röszke: violence eruption on Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water throws at the Serbian border near Röszke against several hundred displaced people.
Euronews correspondent D<0xC3><0xA1>niel Bozsik witnessed the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
A police line had been formed behind them, and a water thrower was standing behind the policemen.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
Officials initially used uninterrupted pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas has been poured into the direction of the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now retreated somewhat in anticipation.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman has been taken out of the zone.
The children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees were suffocating and suffering from shortness of breath.
Serbian police spokesmen also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. central bank
The world is watching as the U.S. central bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade or not.
A poll of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half, who were still last week's opinion that the Fed would do this, now thinks the Fed will hold on to a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to agree to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 a.m.
Deadly shooting at Delta State University leaves apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later on the day shot and killed his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" to him in the first murder and wanted to announce "he could do it unheard of on duty."
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number by 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and he also mentioned that there was a “sweet dog” in the house, but who “will not disturb anyone,” but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: “I’m so sorry I wanted to, I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was “no information, no evidence” for a “triangle relationship.”
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they had been married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said Prentiss was "absolutely best friends" with her daughter.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, ran on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lifeline states on the university’s website.
Stars Who Lost Their Bringer of Happiness
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also reportedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this surely demands its tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa to restructure the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major group building.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization.
150 of the world’s approximately 1000 executives will cost the company’s construction work.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and valuing Eurowings’ low-cost subsidiary.
The aim of the reorientation is to contribute about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million per year in revenue and cost synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team of Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr.
With the re-establishment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take on Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines signed under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of annual revenue of 30 billion euros.
New Negotiations with Pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Cockpit Pilots’ Association (VC), the negotiations are to resume after the legal strike on Thursday.
This was reported by the trade union.
The topic of the talks will be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible "in a year with a predicted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the pilots' transitional supply, the "Wings" savings concept is the background.
In the fight against competitors, Lufthansa is expected to store routes on the Eurowings Group’s low-cost line.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left-leaning defender to tears and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, it's very hard and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it will take six months, and he won’t play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an eleven-meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an eleven-meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's getting very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you know it almost from the outside.
Unless, of course, you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's 1971 environmental fable, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website, and continues: "fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
Everything good and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a description of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amidst the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree and to see a real tree.
As if that were not yet suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial from the m<0xC3><0xA6>d to the m<0xC3><0xA6>d to the m<0xC3><0xA6>d, and even the air is a t<0xC3><0xA6>d to the t<0xC3><0xA6>ff is a hore,
Although he does admit to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's action. Here he hears an unnamed boy, like the local environment, through the money-hungry, tree-falling wedge, splurge in the thneed-on-the-throwing-on-the-throwing-on-the-throw of the-throw of the-protest.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task has been delegated to a helper who has not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not provide any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with being excluded from England’s team, but it’s still tough
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the squad England chose for the tour, a replay of the 3-0 Test Series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an outspoken victory.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t wear scars from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth is removed from the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to dismiss Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best picks.
A long time ago, Lyth's career would have been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets another run for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his stance, even though he didn’t perform so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s primarily a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only charge that could be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – as Lyth was in top form – but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman that I highly appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very hard.
He must have at least the same chances as the one before him, but of course this depends on the team standings in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen next to Cook hit what would give an extra spin bowler and get four quicks popped up, and I don't mind.
I don’t see why a batsman can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred runs at once and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has impressed me very much as a young man.
People might look at his stats – 31 with the batter on average and 35 with the ball on average – and think it’s a point, but there aren’t a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor for the test matches could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with the above.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don’t have a problem with that for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit <0x3D> Britain’s exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy goes into a flurry by 2017
David Cameron’s unfinished renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fierce because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A friend of European diplomats recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own, are fed up with Britain’s own agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes they usually don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes for an outside-looking UK within the EU tent - "Let us not be alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where we don't care.
Germany’s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the exaggerated long-suffering such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine they’re going to rip a leg out to help the selfie brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK — something they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, while the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a ploy" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU skeptics are the press barons’ oligarchy, but they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the Ore Euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his insanity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fighting villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-indigenous people who own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly to her, but found that sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla is better to distribute bananas to distract him rather than be his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum whirlwind, because Blair had set the principle of the unenacted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who opened a door behind him.
The press has never forgiven him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back in Westminster on Monday – I told him he didn’t need to waste any more time on me – seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott Murdoch’s 80s strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in development - I would like to say it kindly.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye trend and the wild fields of Tory’s small Englishism can probably say yes to it.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when the trailfinder was struggling in it, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleague on television without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay “under all circumstances”—Benn’s expression—was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contestants and MPs after all reports on their clause meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the buzzing bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the swindle of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right to not give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for a self-evident, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguity about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the minor difference is a central dog.
As with his ambiguity about NATO – Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching an exit campaign – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of home for their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start of Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the “fundamental report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A leading article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extraordinarily windy base” on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said that the public expects that PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) in order to bring their opinions on the harms of various types of nicotine-containing products together.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEOs were previously reported to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also endorsed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said they received funds from an e-cigarette maker, but not the funding he was supposed to receive from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the board are not provided, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry funding on paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also took part in the meeting.
The group’s research “remarkably admits that there is a lack of “hard evidence for damage to most products on most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had already been responded to earlier.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Every second smoker dies from his or her addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By presenting clear evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
Former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, likely seen by a smaller audience, in fiercely controversial timelines against their rivals' most popular shows and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC unsuccessfully for six years during his time on Channel 4.
“I have problems with the idea that the BBC commissions or sends programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least give it to programs that others don’t do or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm to it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for TV series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what former Sky director Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you pretty much can't measure the audience, but they're fulfilling their duties, and they can argue if they've seen on their seemingly sacred missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion that have never gone to broadcasting fees, "Well, of course we've never seen those programs go."
You put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee, "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also made a statement before the committee on Tuesday, called on the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of the BBC's production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example of changing this to "inform, educate and educate" on public-law television broadcasters in Australia and Canada.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the proms, from which he said only a handful are shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The pulses work by turning on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers reading and writing brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that would give electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblasts and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass unhindered tissue and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertisements Shame on UK Arms Trade
Amnesty International anti-weapons exhibition video.
Horrible killer drones!
Knee-disrupting bone joints!
Streubombe!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest weapons trade fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to bring to light the British government’s willingness to bring weapons to London’s repressive regime in London’s International Centre.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of inbox keys, which are claimed to "get access to about a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements and note that they have to go outside to the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade plaques greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the Arms Fair – through an ExCeL calendar vacancy – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic dubious corporate advertising, but "by inflating with bright colors and animation it remains more sticky."
“They’ve done a fantastic job of helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an entry by the British government and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Weapon Fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors swirl fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS RS fired from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped combat head that delivers outstanding after-effects within the target."
Whatever it is, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have angered - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The admission to student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to black out: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues, and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and dress up their underwear.
Related: Don’t Think About Starting a Relationship at the University
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-space boom culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy I’ve used to interact with you.”
Try to feel when a comrade is exhausted from sociability – and send him an SMS instead of tapping.
Speaking of clapping: do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
Since you're starting college at the height of the back-many, knocking on people's doors to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the 1950s welcome "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something for you. So, and now please smile when I'm standing up to you a couple of women.
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friendships.
Your roommates feel obligated to entertain themselves and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to fall asleep when they clapp.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Of course, clawing chickens is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
Chances are they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying, and you have my sympathy – but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make a noise that prevents people from sleeping or from working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb, you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if it was okay for them to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They reacted to it with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she let her own music plaster, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be profoundly embarrassing if you held a roommate for your future spouse, ran to her, divorced again and then had to see her every day and perhaps coexist as she disguises all of her common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way – but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make some sense to your lower body.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unenclosed room, the boundary between an ulcer and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good punch is funny, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding - but never seduce someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not tack their belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
Detached houses for refugees, single-family, low-payers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds row houses for people who don’t have a lot of money in the central French corner valley.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single-parent mother and the low-earner."
“I’m showing you how to build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old says in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how quickly to create affordable living space: he builds in a project row houses for refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability.
Because people stay here in large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates the integration.
This is different if you put people in blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I will go back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
It's easy to see.
The construction lasted six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have successfully completed my project under construction law.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening damocles sword special construction and the parking regulations.
Ugly.
It is still under consideration that whoever creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is no room for this.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely wrong.
But don't you exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It’s true: we’ve had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can barely afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single-parent mother or the low-earner.
I will show you how to build even today cheaply and well.
That's what it is.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it’s ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation because they receive an error message that says that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm goes down or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That might mean deleting apps to create space — but Apple has made it more unlikely by slashing the update, and it will also be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could cause the update to stop.

Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg has only one motto left in the fight for the Formula 1 World Championship against his clear-leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second before the start in the decisive seven overseas races emphasized "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defender and two-time champion Hamilton.
The British have already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and are also taking the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence Singapore’s Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a thunder bell hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, increasing the membership to 19 players.
The new member is entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to the cure more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a member of the First Class Merit Cross and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has been supported by Gauselmann with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who are unable to make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent quests should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Headquarters is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and a new contact point has been opened at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city centre.
More specifically, at Staufenberg Square.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, from now on seniors and seekers will receive information on issues such as health insurance or health insurance services.
For years we have found with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also, not infrequently, many services of the cash registers are not used, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly yet understood," explained the new mistress Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the civil hospital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health and wellness courses.
To this end, the saludis were taken to the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
Offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for Prevention, Precaution and Rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters office in the city centre is seen by both managing directors especially in the demographic change.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, the Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration celebrations, the district office is also dedicated to the association in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation made a great contribution so that seniors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-tier leaguer Würzburger Kickers was not yet fixed due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October has now been set as a date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third-league FC Würzburger Kickers has now finally ended.
It will be played on Tuesday 6 October at 7 pm at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are pleased that we now know when the game will go on stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now-launched ticket pre-sale.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third-party league player.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games do have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg won in the final round of the last 16 teams in 2010 with victories at the district league 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB association cup 2016/2017.
The defending champion is third-league underdog SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the artist’s house said on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Kunsterhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after the Second World War at the Technical University of Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Viennese Hofburg and to transform the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park Penalty: Tim Wiese Accuses Policewoman with Money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been spotted in Bremen.
Once a footballer, Tim Wiese, a former national goalkeeper in Germany and a wrestler at Bremen and Hoffenheim.
30 kilograms of muscle mass, according to his own statement, has been added over the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not agree.
Wiese had his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a park-room keeper displaying a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the fine at her feet, as the "Image" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
“The matter is still in the test,” says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not weed will be displayed.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rainforest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the flowering of marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have ripped off the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghan
Police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday night, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, according to police, and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
Three people also stopped at the site of the gas station.
One of these men now yelled at the young man and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a broken nose and bleeded heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed out and quivered at the percussionist, he first let go of his victim.
The injured young man was now taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to their apartment and passed there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There, he was attacked again by the perpetrator and another male person.
With the help of a punch, the victim’s face and thighs were stabbed.
The injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only one vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second batsman was said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was wearing a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310,000
Silvia Müller-Gogoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeinde mayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still halfway with his successor in the coming months.
After a refurbishment phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, until then he will invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310,000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gonoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at Verdener Hospital and wants to get into practice next year as well.
“We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The couple liked the idea of operating their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany families over the years".
As an advantage, he also sees himself soon to be his own boss.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank Müller, the father of two families, grew up there, followed by his medical studies in Hanover, in several medical practices, as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as an Oberarzt in Sulingen, he was also appointed as the Chief Notary in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and volunteers in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Starting on September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as house doctors.
“The endoscopy is coming out,” says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a speaker room more.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50000 as part of a funding programme from the district (25,000 euros) as well as from the municipality of Samt (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued,” says Samtgemeinde Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, in the North German average practice there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is yet another home doctor’s practice.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller’s practice acquisition: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, those who attend Müller’s speaking class continue to look especially in familiar faces: takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their farewell an era ends in Asendorf, after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
“In the beginning we only had two rooms,” recalls Ursel Felstehausen.
A little bit of courage she already feels after a long time.
“But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely still see many patients often,” says the internist.
Her husband adds smilingly, "We have a 6000 square meter plot."
"I used to push myself before gardening, now it could be different".
The couple also has two grandchildren and loves to travel.
Croatia: "We're letting the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be lifted at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also do this “of course”.
The safety and security of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "clear signals are needed," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovene border.
It requires a controlled approach.
Croatia Considers "Korridor" - Slovenia Refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and, in some cases, to build corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not what Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar saw in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will instead intensify border surveillance - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to lock its borders for refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfill his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing on Tuesday night to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to seize her in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles constantly arrive with new refugees in the Croatian town of Tovarnik.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country is expected to have around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, were rerouted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denies that it is to instruct people to take certain routes: “We cannot, nor do we want to do this,” it said.
According to media reports, at least in the early morning, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, during the day more buses would be expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometers away.
“We heard that Hungary was allowed, so the police told us that we should go here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to continue traveling through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
As a result, the already predicted shift of the Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west route could now actually occur.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "full possibilities for border control".
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this group since 2007, and the EU partners have been giving the country a good testimonial ever since when it comes to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local sighting in Horgos: he considers the debate on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers rate migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aides have already begun distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not unsafe: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian War, still unencumbered minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been dispatched to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information seized, insider transactions were supposed to have been made in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over $100 million was recovered.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our country’s borders will eventually be captured,” the SEC said in a statement.
The proceedings against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizhilf Mannheim has been around for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
People handle their worries, some quick steps, some comfortably bouncing.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
Stop the city rails.
pulsating, splendid life in the beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large boards each with the headline "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospitaller drew attention to its 20-year existence and is confronted with mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospital Assistance is available to the passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grabs the creed and adds the phrase "can testify to my life", "can read", "run the camper through the United States", "stop the war" or "don't suffer long", others stay short, read, say phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.
Over and over again, small discussions develop at the edge about the action itself, about life, how to deal with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
“Only if I realize that for me at some point the end of this world will come, can I live responsibly,” says the director of the Deaconical Work Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospital Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and grief accompaniment is among the volunteers of the first hour.
Confronted by personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to be involved in the care of the deceased.
When the Ecumenical Hospizhilf sought Volunteers by call, she immediately contacted and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers—43 women and two men—accompanied by the victim and his family in private households, hospitals, nursing homes, and in the hospice of St. Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is well able to cope with her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
“I see life from another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of health insurance and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as the training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, other personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx Result Mixed, Financial Outlook for 2016 Decreased
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it would make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases of an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November.
The company said it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "brings solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx made $692 million, 6% more than in the previous year.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenue increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zack’s analysts surveyed expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping, which has stagnated revenue in its express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it’s time to raise the lead rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to take off from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
While most data from the economy show it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make precautionary Fed representatives anxious to amplify this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds — even if it’s only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself insures the financial market.
About half of economists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg have predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy would maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this point,” he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty as to when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year, despite complaints from Liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level seen by the Fed as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation was constantly below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of labor market tensions,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared a slowdown in China’s economy would shake global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, the market turmoil influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be pulling the trigger in this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US employee.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better under control.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts will be on the U.S. economy, and there is hardly any reliable data that describes developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “reinvent” its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Asset Management Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently unrelated to the fundamental economic data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its lead rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings “despite limited noticeable impacts on growth in the United States,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed rescinded these cuts.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability first during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
Recent turbulences are not coming close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into a situation where she’s afraid of rising interest rates because the markets are excited,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole mall makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the checkout desks and has various pick-up options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat shop is extensive, as is the fish shop - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even bake for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and gall, pork natural gut, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cashier.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small living aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support selfless asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, teaching is very different than at a proper school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research findings suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The city council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar installation.
The planning for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder Sportgelände is progressing step by step: at the most recent municipal meeting, the draft construction proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the board had decided, among other things, on a request for a construction law "exception" and "exemption" from the valid reconstruction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special shape with respect to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "sattle roof with non-middle first and roof overhang" is to be built.
Background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roof slope, which, for energetic reasons - unlike the construction plan prescribed - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
An "exemption" was therefore necessary because the renovation plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the roofing - with the Bernrieder Municipal Council generally moving more restrictively in respect of applications for exemptions.
However, the construction of the gymnasium is not a recurring project: "We are not creating a precedent", says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium building at the Sportzentrum is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from the school and broad sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Land Council Office for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital will be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of staff move from Peissenberg to Schongau.
This is according to the surprising plans of the district’s Hospital GmbH, which the county councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will be held next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to be employed at the hospital in Peissenberg.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with fishermen and the further existing Inner Station.
The rooms were there.
Employees who are unable to come to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
Employees should be informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who should take over the succession, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who declared himself ready to take over the management from 1 October and to move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "improvement" and an expansion of the offer in the area of "Inner Medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to manage both houses, will be closed permanently in Peißenberg until next year’s former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landratin Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board, has faced rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal government, is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," said Fischer about the quasi-relocation to the Lech, which was received "positively and very understandable" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house, where fisherman has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years, has not been there.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and birth control.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are requested at the Bergischen HC tonight (20.15 p.m.).
The Bundesliga table leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for overemphasis.
In the last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have some good luck there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by gunshots.
During the avalanche at a corn field near Pratau (county Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, police said.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was at first unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
16-Year-Old Missing from Rhineland-Palatinate Victim of Violence Crimes
A suspect has led police to the body of the 16-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman’s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, prosecutors and police said on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old man also arrested on Tuesday night is considered a suspect who confessed to the act and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit to an autumn party in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim’s personal belongings.
In the case of interrogations in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a suspected act against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to authorities, the detainee admitted in the police interrogation that the 16-year-old had been killed and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old is due to be presented to the inmate on Wednesday, while investigators charge him with death row.
Further investigations should be carried out to provide information on the specific circumstances of the act.
Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable home.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The social housing sector is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overcrowded in many major cities.
They are competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units will need to be built each year by 2020.
To this end comes a study commissioned by the Association "Social Housing Construction".
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer required to live in an asylum seeker’s home.
Many then stumble upon the housing market and line up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also highlights significant shortcomings in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that will increase from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were missing in the rolling areas, says Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals were forced to live in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed in the "Hotel Mama" involuntarily longer because of the flu on the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
In doing so, new incentives are intended to boost social housing construction.
Thus, the property tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidised apartments could be temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are required.
The support programme for refugee housing of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, with 184 million euros already more than half of the around 300 million euros available had been collected on Monday night.
Now the project could even be upgraded.
Refugees have free access: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
There is virtually no more transit to Hungary, as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the passage through Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to consult with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the collapse of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to get to Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian television station RTL reported.
The day before, Hungary had sealed its border for refugees.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the Serbian border with the EU’s neighbouring Croatia.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this, the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mining spacers should now quickly create a safe passageway.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 people.
Shortly before closing the gate on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian law cited the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime.
As a result, 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the southern border town of Szeged.
The convicts face prison sentences of up to five years and expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established "transit zones" at the border on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition in Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday, there were 40 more refugees in the area.
In practice, however, no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary’s view, Serbia is a “safe third country”.
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the “transit zone” in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Locksmiths were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border resort was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria only reaches a few refugees.
The country has also tightened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was halted in the morning on instructions from German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "beached" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing with suitcases at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted by train to Passau.
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the refugee flow, it was closed for them in Wernstein,” said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the beachside people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to nearby Passau.
Before, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with jause and drinks.
We just said we'll take you to Passau by car.
"That was obvious to us," Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N interview.
They were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
“We were very pleased,” said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday night in Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that train traffic to Germany had been stopped.
The regional train, however, was stopped at the Inn in Wernstein, near the border.
In Wernstein, cross-border is generally high in price.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, days before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is now sending thousands more to us is a logical result of a seemingly sacred policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the Röszke camp to build structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has highly formally and publicly put the Hungarian government’s position in the dungeon of National Socialism.
It is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic states in the border areas who suffer from this policy.
The refugees will also have to find that the “golden land” that they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing flows of refugees and the impending winter, to create humane conditions for asylum seekers.
And there will be an even greater one – maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has everything to do with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in Traiskirchen’s first reception centre has already been addressed by Konrad.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also without much turmoil, Konrad said, praising the organisational “mastery”.
The interior ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a "critical situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
To meet the number, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the country’s leaders.
These would have assured him that he would still create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also puts high expectations into the ORF action "Helping like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, we hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be that quartermasters have to adhere to a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the top lights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad argues with his experience that he is more successful in hosting.
I am an older gentleman who is not told the untruth without further ado.
Confidence is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier did not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase the number of employees to three to four.
My own neighborhood search has not been successful so far.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
The city of Linz plans not to open urban gymnasiums and other buildings such as the Tips-Arena and the Design Center for refugee accommodation.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the affected people can now be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in case of emergencies, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The mayor is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also contribute to this.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be closed"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Head of State Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The continued travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, the appropriate border checks are now in place.
There will no longer be any special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, the asylum seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is, for Pühringer, "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general restoration of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2,700 square meters) is to be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in start-up firms of the New Shipyard and later acquiring some.
From the very beginning S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which each belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal (FFG).
The building has been leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2,700 square meters in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opens second store in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are the focus.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to add a dog.
This project had to be postponed by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade in short: Finally, she has now received growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla store opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, now it is all about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time whether I should open another store," Breit says.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also inspired by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Linz area that sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been placed wide by her mother in the cradle.
I get the most when something develops and I can show new trends at feasible prices.
Why so many women find themselves embellished in the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert woman can not answer with final certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump’s Pale ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called Ineber.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for rioters.
Whether he expresses himself hostile to strangers, attacks journalists, or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy – the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is vigorously wobbling up the election campaign.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in the Phelpsian town of Kall, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabited place are over -twenty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Call City in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a movie about Trump.
And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
“I think they find it somewhat exciting, but they’re not so impressed in their cold-city style,” says Simone Wendel.
The native cold town girl has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous shooters, including Trump and the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to mind in “Kings of Kallstadt” (2014) – so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, there is also a tendency to believe that Trump is “already a bit of a big deal,” Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname that the cold city has in the vicinity, "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the hints, she says.
Trump is from the village of the Aneber.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold tomb in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He didn’t pick up Trump because he had once gone off without permission, the director of the Institute of Prussian History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film’s launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken apprehensively about Mexican immigrants to the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“As the one polterts, that’s not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was a born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American more distanced, "he's always so uplifting".
Do you think Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about cold city".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some cold townspeople, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
She felt better if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had said that at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "would he never have come there."
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says winemaker’s daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: “The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, also in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism.
There are already 20 "mountain climbing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it has not caused major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull succeeded in the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night’s result answered this with a clear “yes”.
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5:30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half 720,000.
Hot-seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second night of The Chase Australia will reassure Nine that Hot-Seat will eventually push itself at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to fly over McGuire’s show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Unveiling a secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was shrouded in great secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will be sure to announce whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before they became three out of two, you might have accidentally given a hint of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically omitted why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked “If not you, who should Woods get last rose?”, their answers could become the game spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay – apart from themselves – Wood’s best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah’s) and Sam’s energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I’ve been thinking about that throughout the show,” Jeavon’s Fellows said.
“Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground, it’s so much fun to be with her,” added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the home visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the One".
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game – I am now unreservedly attached to him,” she said.
And when asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the rest of the girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the U.S. — and there were many other teams sending inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a row as did the Aussie rugby league convert at his first point return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also into the ongoing game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly reinforced Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his crappy catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pats on a point restored in the first quarter of the game by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playing field after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
“It was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his origin debut in 2007 when a pass led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian field with gun violence.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters are demanding the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high refugee numbers.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn class in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis at Bavarian schools, if there are no new teachers appropriately for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to Aiwager", Koe told the school.
"We will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfraktion of the Free Voters will meet until Friday in the municipality of Unterfranken.
In fact, different main themes were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will override the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as they existed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
“That’s not how it goes, we have to go to the causes,” said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
That’s why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need federal-wide uniform standards of the federal states."
"Bayern is pushing off, others are not."
“We need to be more actionable.”
But national politics in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot test "Middle level plus" at 47 gymnasiums, in which an extension of the secondary level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it will take nine years to graduate again.
However, this does not go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 issue needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasiums that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Stronger Wall Street helps Dax jump in
The German stock market has closed with profits following an over-expanded, directionless and nervous trading cycle.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer onset of the US exchanges ensure a clear direction, which eventually drove the Dax up 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The MDax averaged 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
Technology-intensive TecDax rose 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.

Many stockholders expect that the markets will be in place until after the interest rate decision in the US and also at the big expiry on the futures exchanges on this Friday.
The discussion about the loads from the nuclear boom has pushed RWE’s stocks to a record low in the meantime and has also left deep traces at Eon.
According to Spiegel, German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in reserves.
The federal government denies the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but eventually lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose a further 3.22 percent at Dax peak.
According to a retailer, a positive report by the U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" came after the weekend.
Investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chipmaker.
In doing so, investments in future-proof wafer technologies and focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were put off again than in the previous year period, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The shares of the automakers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent, respectively.
Volkswagen's advances were taxed by 1.26 percent.
On the German pension market, the turnover yield of listed bonds fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index rose 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.

The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot into the air before retaliating on rubber floors.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It wasn’t immediately clear why the rubber shots used, which are known to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the latest in weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step toward a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers hastened the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators this week voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction site planned in the city
The property at Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000-square-meter area.
A mixture of trade, trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of about 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Jugendzentrum Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
We are waiting for the right offers, says the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The town of Emden had bought a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße, already a few months ago and let the building on it tear down.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for a holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Several contractors are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure retreat
For months, it was negotiated behind closed doors, drilled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Building", presented its plans to the public for the first time in the city development committee of the Emder Council on Monday night.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, who accuse the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went into the offensive from the system-building business management: "We do not yet have an answer to all the questions," he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The 10 to 12 million euro project has been under discussion for months now.
Violent reactions among seaside owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, seaside owner and member of the board of directors representing the interests of the contractors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant cloister that will surpass all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like several other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must come whole bus loads to make it count", says Schulz
However, what exactly happens on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we have to have a final concept,” said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Zwillings-Nachwuchs at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years old and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it says of the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian has kept them tightly attached to the body so far.
First, the "image" was reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verdean Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the weather experts in Miami added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our trip included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first donations collected globally will be doubled to $11 million, up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether lightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric sacral formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained approximately the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% fully resolved the disease and 28% partially resolved the disease.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes was fully resolved in only one percent compared with only about two percent in some cases.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9% to around 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and recorded a more complete 16% increase in weight compared to the gastrectomy group.
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, in obese people who underwent obesity surgery, about 29 percent were less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group,” without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient has his BMI between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they’ve accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard.”
Love Story Plays in the Hunsback
It is a topic that is currently gaining more attention in the arts: A young woman, unpopular and unappealing at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually We Are Not So" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to set a literary monument to her home.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
“It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts in tackling the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions to how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
In the end, we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the US’ violent reaction drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand sanitizers by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of intake of hand sanitizers in children under 12 years of age reported by poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children increasingly come to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them land on the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children intentionally drink disinfectants, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants just because of an inexpensive experience.
Adolescents have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children may be attracted to attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few sprays can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison call center at the University of Kansas Hospital, the Fox 4 transmitter in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn’t leave a sip of whisky around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and if children come to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprays of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was very scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant towels and to store hand sanitizers out of the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banished her from her room.
The police viewed the plan as a "talk" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was lightly injured in a collision on the crossroads between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving on the cross lane towards circular traffic industrial area and realized too late that two forward vehicles had stopped on circular traffic.
Subsequently, he jumped into the back of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a front-facing Ford Fiesta.
The vehicles involved in the accident were subject to property damage of about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.
Rumors: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that around again.
Hearts will fight SFA over accusations of Neilson, and Warburton will be cautious about January recommitments that could destroy the cadre’s unit
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points

Griffiths talks about disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was rejected spontaneously by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They’re talking about both teams and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of excitement in the old-fashioned games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10-man from Aberdeen, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
That’s how we feel, but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious in January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, suggesting he was peeking some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing re-entry and insists he doesn’t want to disturb the Ibrox cadre unit.
Brentford’s former chief executive said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players coming in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own team this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes, more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea stormer Michu, with Celtic in talks during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been battling with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts suspended on SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later revoked - Collum's third red card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he has said, insisting, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The unimproved Hibee was convicted after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding, "It's safe to say I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board of directors still have confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the downturn has to end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the guys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "unbeautiful".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, giving them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's eleven-meter in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have never won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it increases in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It was almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunks disrupted the process
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to put the disturbers in custody.
A breathalcohol test showed 0.89 promille in a 16-year-old.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 miles and was initially in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in an audience gallery in the Death Chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to be afraid.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants it, and you will get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have been better at formulating it,” but she still thinks that what I’m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had trouble with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it, even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the publicity work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go into all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a high probability that he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can’t claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for this.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man Convinced to Get Out of Canning River After Wet Police Hunt
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and shallow water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "slowly persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house-peace incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiated".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the trenches to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt bumper test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had abstained for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like grapes hanging too high."
“I meant nothing to say about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that it all comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk around raised heads, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don’t do that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I'm asked to - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," Moody said.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that’s the case, they should definitely cling to their noses because they failed in trying to cling to me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should this make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps made people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But now I’m at the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer’s frustration levels have built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led to him saying he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied sludge to the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
It was like that on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's flight
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and a subsequent driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver, the police said.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood by the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be indicted for driver’s flight and neglected assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims of ring-fighting
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' tackle as an "agenda setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "ring battles" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely-covered remark to the Storm team after his team had won the final against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two would not "go well out of Queensland".
Bellamy defended his team's tackle and said they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team gave him a confident vote, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It's coming up again and again - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about ringing when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed our defensive system or our techniques all year long, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has brought us the trend shift.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "dull" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of a piece of shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored higher than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are taking breaks and not points something exciting?
For me, these are the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the AAMI Park Pre-Final. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbs with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who could face a life sentence for his attempt to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled to Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-accused at the marina in the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-sustaining punishment for attempting to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that it could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has a clear relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 security deposit to reach his release.
"After reading the state-sanctioned statements of the two persons, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he hand over his Australian and Serbian passports, report daily to the police and adhere to an exit lockdown from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus breaks apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a collision with three trucks on motorway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment, police said.
The driver's house of the accident investigator completely broke apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked for over six hours until 2 p.m.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone as she slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address, and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did so as it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then "proposed to be a policeman to scare them off".
Attorney General Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a addiction - that he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unfamiliar person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then saw the inconsistent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused used computers and playstations to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty under the indictment to having taken indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, to having violated the orders on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court at a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
It was included in the register of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Smugglers move to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being seized outside the main checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, for fear of discovery and arrest, made people increasingly at smaller border crossings.
On the Austrian side, a spokesperson for the Federal Police said.
Since Tuesday, more than 1,000 refugees have been caught in the Passau and Rottal-Inn districts along the border river Inn.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dauwehre.
There, they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration.
At Munich’s main station, according to the Federal Police, there were again significantly more refugees than at the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the capital, a spokesman said this morning.
After reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropical Storm "Henry" in the southwest awaits
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The mighty low is the climax of the tropical storm "Henry", which in recent days has been pulled from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and storms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance with bees from 60 to 90 hour kilometres can be expected.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the carmakers at the IAA show their innovations.
In 2015, it is particularly important to note the movement of the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in high demand: around 28.1 percent of the new approvals, according to the Federal Office of Motor Vehicles (KBA) alone, fell to this segment in August.
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the dealers in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra is not going to be much more expensive.
Opel is making a debut below the biggest competitor VW Golf, starting at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder gasoline engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a fifth-door car.
The second variant will be followed in the spring by the Kombi, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA to new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and sporty GT version.
He will be on the market at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is new in the segment.
With the new model, Nissan wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti fits perfectly into the brand’s design line with its curved lines.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
There is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbocharged engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
The sale of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën downlight put their hands on the front: here the cooling grille was repainted and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was upgraded, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin brick: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of human dignity
The Federal Constitutional Court has granted rights to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel justice facility, who had been housed in a cell too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, detainees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the victims can even hope for money if they have been locked in the spaces that are too narrow for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area at the Berlin-Tegel justice facility between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now on the loose again, was moved to a larger cell.
It is true that his official incarceration lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges upheld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and referred the case back there for re-examination.
You see the human dignity of the man violated.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, it would be "a deterrent to the legal protection of the personality".
The Court of First Instance must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war.
In April, they did not appeal to a prisoner for damages because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
In addition, Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an inmate in a parallel case in November 2009 an unworthy accommodation.
The plaintiff was housed in a cell similar to the Karlsruhe case for 15 to 21 hours a day for over three months.
In recent weeks, Berlin’s prisons have also come to the headlines due to lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore again and again 23 hours, the aggression increases, even it is said to have come to beatings because of the tense situation.
According to the judiciary press office, 21 jobs in bricks are not occupied due to youth shortages, 19 are due to fall out in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do it, and we can do it".
What comes to Germany, the following overview provides.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
That’s almost twice the amount that has been built so far (250,000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond each year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million euros to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the Pestel Institute’s point of view: 80,000 social housing units would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, says Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While previously there was a ban on work for asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residency obligation, which restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, a majority of them have adopted the view that refugees should be allowed quicker access to the labour market, also due to the lack of skilled workers.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is the lack of German skills.
To date, there is not a sufficient range of general and vocational language courses available.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts.
In Thränhardt’s view, therefore, the construction of networks is the royal road to labour integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the kitas, an estimated ten to 15 percent: “For the de-rooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together first,” says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handzettel in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity – for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students without German skills are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffes of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Association estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception was Berlin so far, but now Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has given up his stance.
Student-volunteer refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicants’ Benefits Act when they begin their studies.
The latter generally do not get a baboon, since they do not fall under the circle of baboon-entitled persons.
Patience refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span will be shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, according to Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should receive Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association, which takes care of the newcomers professionally.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus, representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant it certain control options.
This also includes the willingness to take a firm stand against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to escalate such conflicts in Germany “have immediately succeeded in their right to stay here, in Germany,” he said on Bayerischer Rundfunk.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than a topic of the whole of society today.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, for almost a decade, an anti-discrimination body and a general law on gender equality.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal Opportunities for All: What migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have long demanded and to which international agreements such as the anti-racism convention Germany are committed must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As for man-power and capacity, we’re doing that,” he told the daily mirror.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system.
In order to avoid inconveniences, Montgomery requires all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
Subsequent payments could be settled with the Federal States.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to eat off so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits provided for by the Asylum Applicants’ Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly make the language barriers to create.
Even so far, the Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has proven that migrants are being clarified worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, interpreting costs would have to be taken over, she insists.
Many refugees would be helped, but also already with more general medical facilities in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people, there is HIV education.
However, with the partly other images of the disease, German doctors clearly come from their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasit seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, perhaps even relief is in sight by the refugees.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of refugees arriving in Germany are estimated by the Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer (BPtK) to be mentally ill: most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the TU Munich proves that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive in Germany traumatized.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rashes and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe scarcity, and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new stage "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to bring every age group into the realm of fascinating acrobatics, animal costumes and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites the maneuvers on the brick wash to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior manager.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current maneuvering.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important to us to get people out of their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” says the 27-year-old junior manager.
"Managen cocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", as director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus impresses with talented artists from all over the world.
Outstanding at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with jokes and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craftsmanship.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to take the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words, they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is meant to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertip feeling and joints.
Balancing with the single wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated by its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
“The animals belong to our family,” says Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misconduct in the attitude of circus animals is only all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also says, “If our animals are not well, we are not well either.”
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strip unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read out of the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn’t feel comfortable, it doesn’t want to get in the way either.
The most important thing is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on her zebroid Jumbo, a blend of a Shetland ponytail and a zebra stud, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
“But then, all of a sudden, our little jumbo was there,” Brigitte Probst says.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the maneuver, but for that it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There must be something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether it’s five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m.
On Sundays, the program starts at 11 and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are discounted.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe Speaks Wrong in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread across social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by allegations by MEPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and that they were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with calls.
Last month, they had exhausted him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their phones warning them to disrupt Mr Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The spokesperson said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job cut will lead to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who is expected to lead the unit after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses to support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that tightly-focused companies are delivering better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had severed the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that does not heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had previously suffered.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The Premier Injuries Ltd investigation records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have the most injury days to record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in injury rate will continue during the final season.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger will set a rotation within the team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are supposed to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players that need a little quick break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to go through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring on the judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
“This drive is huge,” Wenger said.
It has never worked with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I’m in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Men's Friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicides among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that when the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more profoundly.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of footballing in cozy armchairs, and Ross’s yearning for Rachel – all came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone service explained to me: "My listening role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase “I’m going to deal with it” has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it’s perceived as weakness when you’re talking openly about problems.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It presents very clearly the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend’s Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone at Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria will meet at his Champions League debut on Tuesday and help PSG pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took the lead when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory over Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion on the road, but after that they missed a number of occasions before finally increasing their lead, as Cavani in the 61st minute a header.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only seek qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2:0, to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed, even though there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven’t scored one or two more goals yet.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes after his injury, which was able to keep a 2–2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the Premier League on the weekend, but he was kicked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was named the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted why, when he walked into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense, before he passed away to Johan Wiland nicely in the long E.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed by Kevin Trapp's paws in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some miscarriages and bad finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who was beaten on no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then gave up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a shotgun, which was pushed past by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, with the Uruguayer achieving his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended all the thinking that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was finally recognized a goal.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was playing a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Hut off from Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which is hit by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt relief plan.
London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issuance of reference rights brought Glencore’s stock exchange trading on early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of its broader plans to settle about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares in value of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reached the city administration in Weimar after a long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The latest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and recapture President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively,” the statement said.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington in Seattle before moving on to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports cars borrowed and scrapped
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
Then came the evil awakening on the rainy highway.
At a company in Gotha, you can fulfill your dream and once borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
A 29-year-old man from Gotha County did the same.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was then over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the trench on a wet road and drove into the dashboard.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at 40,000 euros.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 changeover to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern apparently stood just a few years before the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Pokal winner, four times Champions League winners, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - Xavi's title list is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he had already stood before the 2008 European Championship before the departure from Barcelona.
"I was told that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing,” he says.
And so did FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
The change, however, did not occur.
And the leading man for it today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
“Pep told me that I wouldn’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi?
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, switched off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the King class triumph.
Matt Damon Plays Diversity in Filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project's selected screenplay.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it when you’re in the film and not when you’re in the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shockingly, with insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the actor's comments from The Martian were solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
“I would like to encourage people to think about — whoever the director will be — how they treat the character of harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a slut who is beaten by her white sucker.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their directing "could eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded before disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged lawmakers and authorities to field discriminatory practices against colored restraint.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter" (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a contestant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
The British completed the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, however, Caldiero completed this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had a life," Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
So suddenly .. like I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to complete the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's making any noise about it.
He's just as happy to have done what he's done.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers smuggle past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler, but played this game perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon retained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the pen, and that’s why I want to get very focused into the game.
Designed Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's been swinging the punch well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in the batting, looked significantly better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a color, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy crossed the wall, the only man he faced, in front of designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who escaped a two-run run to right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings, Wall scored an RBI double against Tigers closes Bruce Rondon, scoring 5-4.
The right-hander, however, outplayed Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was still unmoved, to kick off the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
“Obviously not the start I wanted,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable when I got off and felt like I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the Leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scoring a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"It was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relief right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Remarks: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez quit due to an injury to the shoulder.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder dislocation, is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris has been 1-1 on four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 due to a fracture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be sheltered in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people arriving in it will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It was estimated that 450 to 750 refugees would arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government presidium responsible for the inauguration.
Due to the large number of refugees, Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria a possibility.
"I believe that decisive reflection on military options for action cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He accused European states of “collective road-seeking.”
Four years ago, we were happy that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict lands crashing at our doorstep," he said on German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive intensification of international assistance on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls at the southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on Austrian television station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria either.
“No, that’s agreed,” she explained.
On the question of an agreement on which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks on this issue between the Director-General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, asked for a special summit next week.
On Sunday, Germany began transient border checks.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (22 September), the EU’s interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting.
In view of the strong refugee pressure in Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany wants to support the countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection are getting it too.
But those who do not have a stay perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "giant effort of force".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stranded on the Balkan route.
On Tuesday night, Hungary closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest that it would also block the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking evacuation routes over Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said about the planned new border crossing.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
According to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border in Turkey.
Spacecraft Cassini finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice cap of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
This concludes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
According to this, the moon easily wanders on its orbit around the ring planet.
This movement is small, but still too large for a constantly fixed celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that liquid water must be present under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn’s moon, spewing water vapor and ice particles and thus feeding Saturn’s so-called E-ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded back then.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama misses 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich had to give up offensive force Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had already complained about the pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced pause".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
“Of course we have to think now,” said Necat Aygün, sports director of the “Image” magazine, looking at the possible commitment of an uncompromising professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player will begin his career training.
Okotie was injured in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent head-to-head collision.
Contrary to his initial fears, he remained without a serious blessing.
No dietary fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often advised by them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Most importantly, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The color of the bowl alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The U.S. parcel service UPS will resume up to 95,000 relief for the Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are especially sought.
As early as last year, UPS had increased its staff by 95,000 relief for the holiday season.
Faced with the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking precautions since last year to be armed for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First dry storm, then marked cold front
In the coming night, the Föhn breaks through the valleys of the Alpine north side, as Meteo-Switzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night on Thursday, the fog blows partly with thunderstorms through the fog valleys.
After drying on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings heavy rainfall, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong southwest stream.
On the northern side of the Alps, the föhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
As a result, until Thursday morning, the föhn blows in the föhn valleys with bees ranging from 60 to 100 km/h, individually and especially in the Urnerland, sometimes with more than 100 km/h.
The fog can penetrate into the neighbouring central country, and on the mountains even hurricane bays of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy dryness provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to pile on the Alpine south slope.
There is rain here, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, in the south of the Alps over the next 48 hours, some of the rains are expected to exceed 100 litres per square meter, after heavy rains have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the dryer blows the air, following which a cold front rolls with heavy, partly whitish rain from west to east across Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the wind rises strongly to stormy, and temperatures drop significantly.
The following days will be in the autumn with 15 to 20 degrees in the north, while in the south it will be sunny and warmer on weekends with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of mayor Ignazio Marino, an unnamed place in the park on the Oppio hill was named after the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the "Piazza Martin Luthero" he is now regarded as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes for centuries as a minority could often only live in secret their faith.
With the square it will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months as a young Augustinian monk in Rome around the turn of the year 1510/11.
He perceived the city at that time as a common sin Babylon.
His negative impressions probably strengthened him, according to historians, in his later battle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the apostasy trade.
Hammer Artist Invested Three Years in Personal Interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which now appears with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "fun" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, it can seem quite dark.
For about three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books".
There are cycles that are devoted to topics such as the way of the cross, the plague, the commandments or our fathers.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible sites on the basis of the painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, which here formulates his very personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewellery ribbon has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows for a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrenhuter order.
"There was an upbringing with the pipestock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this up so that I may be able to bear myself with the Lord Father again."
His second concern was to make art more important again in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds is today characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being pushed out.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to be able to "infiltrate" the images, to be able to influence them, to discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Old Bible in the Otmar Old Foundation, that he was "always" a lover of Otmar Old Art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not pay attention to the full collection of the Bible, but chose the subjects important to him, also mysterious.
"This was not cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "Here it is about the images, the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the language of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will open on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX-Bahn nears
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, hill modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train it was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused devastation, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hills postponed, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First City Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to announce now in the Children and Youth Committee.
“I hope that something visible will happen this year,” she said.
It should then be started with the work at the former indoor swimming pool without "further memorial break".
DFB Intensifies Commitment to Refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga sets a clear signal on the weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany and ensures that politics is helping to cope with the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be our country's biggest challenge since reunification."
“No one can say that I have nothing to do with it, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It must be of interest to everyone to get this issue under control," DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At his annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'm next Wednesday at the Chancellor's Office and I'll meet Minister of State Mrs <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor there."
"The issue will certainly play a central role there," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
But the decisive moves must be made by politics.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“Over the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said at the outskirts of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian’s/Malta.
A number of federal officials also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are putting a clear sign if they will wear the inscription "We help - <0x23>refugeeswelcome" on the left shirt sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler told the "Image" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
"The refugee drama touches everyone, no one must see away."
"We can be federal football leagues, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim’s managing director Peter Rettig called it a “prominent sign of the league.”
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the UEFA European Qualification match against Hungary on Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community of German football".
It’s great that all 36 license associations started their own projects in their locations.
It’s also great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, lives in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000 each for the integration of refugees.
“The associations have already collected the entire amount for 2015,” Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
Bill McDermott, the CEO of Europe’s largest software group, has reportedly lost his left eye in a crash in early July.
In the crash on the staircase in his brother's home in the United States, he fell on a glass of water that he wore in his left hand after midnight, the "Economy Week" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he was powerless, then he got out on the street - that's what he told us last week," said Hasso Plattner, co-founder of WiWo.
But McDermott could do his job.
“At the beginning of October we will meet before the supervisory board meeting in Walldorf,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and was “fully able to work”.
McDermott announced in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software companies.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
“Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time,” McDermott told the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anybody can happen like this."
"It's important to get up again when you're down."
McLaren Replacement Pilot Magnussen Not Fighting
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said he suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He is therefore questioned at the night race in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reserve driver for the two main drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without a giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also miss the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach said: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his trunk on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all the Europa League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
It is also very likely that he will contest the second part.
The research statement by player Reus that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl believes it can be traced: "So Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance of taking the title."
Robotic Cars: Government Wants a Leading Role for Germany
Germany, according to the will of the federal government, should be technological pioneers in the change of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for, among other things, investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA Automesse of a "new age of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who will also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital listening radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being developed on motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to "do not impose additional liability risks on the driver", the federal government wants to "review the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The federal government also wants to advocate a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
Still, driverless vehicles on public roads are “first to be expected far after 2020”.
The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site is estimated by the study authors at around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic,” said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in case of accidents and the security of personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, Germans still see self-driving cars as sceptical – much more so than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute, commissioned by the testing organisation Dekra, on Wednesday concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe autonomous cars will be enforced in the next ten years, with 32 percent not expecting it to happen in 20 years, while 31 percent do not expect it to happen.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the United States 33 percent.
However, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the entire ride on all roads.
On the highway, at least 15 percent of the traffic could be imagined, in the mud 45%.
Almost one in four would not leave the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis-EM
According to the current state of play in the title fights from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision is due by 22 September at the latest.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf said during the European Championships in Düsseldorf.
At the time, Boll was on a flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, the downside is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said European singles champion Dimitri Ovtcharov.
Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
At the time, Timo was also missing, and we became European champions.
"We should orient ourselves to that," said the world ranking fifth.
England national footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis in the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger indicated a broken leg.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mix of a very large fashion show and a wax-figure gruel cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: window dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits, among other things – and by putting men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I’m the child terrible of skin couture because I have white hair.”
“It used to be bleached, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Bürgersteig auf die Laufsteg), which is to be seen on September 18th at the Art Hall of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a pleasure that the fashion designer has changed his initially repulsive attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because, "For me, an exhibition sounded a little bit after death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal, Canada, and at Paris Station.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly-overlooking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort has been made: for example, a stylist was engaged to styling the dolls.
14 tons of material have been shipped to Munich, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special charmer: a leather trousers outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old teddy is also on display in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first fashionable walking experiments.
As a child (he wasn’t a good student and bad at football) he wore his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, of course, I bought them.
For his first fashion show, he couldn’t afford the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plauener Spitze as a fashion niche
Previously, it was about the long embroidery machines and about ploughing to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers, who processed them further to, for example, ceilings and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of Plauen.
However, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen Spitze, fashion played a larger role, was then pushed by the home textile industry – and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional suits.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which draws on past style eras, represents an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Embroidery trade association together with nine other companies.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been broken.
There are almost no more private department stores and also the wholesale.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way yet.
The mass goods are now much cheaper manufactured in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
There are plenty of reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: “This also applies to the materials used.”
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Außenstelle of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
To counteract the competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
This creates a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
In some places, the machine sticks small balls.
Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before, I could not start with a traditional Plauener tip".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze – young and old,” says Reuters.
It also delivers to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a souvenir.
This is how I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning a new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not a remake, but a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical baby girl.
It is about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already fixed: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy to the world more broadly
The economy needs to open up more widely to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday of a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve strategies for business start-ups,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a governmental business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also ease controls on the powers transferred to companies and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide better services for them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to employ professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also took part in the meeting, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which is presenting a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: “Risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies are being passed on with full force to pregnant women and toddlers,” explains Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predators are already so heavily loaded with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold on the basis of the limit values still in force.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5% would remain unsold.
In return for this relief, the EU wants to increase limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this a “trick” because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already meet the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction manoeuvre that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal that is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause, especially in unborn, damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment says on its homepage, with regard to the applicable maximum values, that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is mainly brought into the environment by the burning of coal.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Greens-Bundestag Member of Parliament, Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanent and extensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
