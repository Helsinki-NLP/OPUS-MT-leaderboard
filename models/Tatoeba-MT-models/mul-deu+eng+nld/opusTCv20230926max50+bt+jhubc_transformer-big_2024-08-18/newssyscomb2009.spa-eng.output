Populist right win in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a noticeable weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People’s Party (OVP) has suffered strong and special losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is being seriously tampered with.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the populars who called for these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, Vice-Chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved already this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party’s presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and most approximate starting point of the election results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the Social Democrats would repeat the same thing in 1999.
For this development Haider clearly bets who already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India can be cooled
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally harvesting beetles cannot be solved, Czech-Indian relations could be cooled, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then yes, it would certainly come to this cooling," he noted after the meeting, which was organized on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was exempt from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises appealing to the Supreme Court and then pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by obtaining the convicted person “legal competent support,” the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already being achieved by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a horrific mistake to incarcerate and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received the promise from the Indian side that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it depicts Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small lost point in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes the complete one.
It governs this lofty and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the firm ground
Coastal countries have begun to fiercely dispute the new territories under the sea today.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called continental border which sometimes extends to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental shelf.
“Simplely, continental boundary means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often the limit of the two hundred nautical miles, i.e. pure economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The country's request to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the Continent Border should be submitted with scientific documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist assistance committee.
To date, the commission has processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have moved forward,” adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime domain.
However, New Zealand also got it - the seabed surface that the commission awarded last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in their study.
The profits that will be deducted from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually filing their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental border ends, the ocean floor region declared by the Treaty as a “common heritage of humanity” begins.
No nation has an exclusive position here.
The right of exploitation in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,” says director Mikulka emphatically, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the capacity to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatras.
“A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete sites containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the command of German special forces was in the place of action
To solve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
Thus, at the place of release were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, the aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation as well as experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted aid from Germany to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that moment didn't come," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible rescue payments.
Meanwhile, the healthy and saved people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, 5 tourists and the special forces have to return in Airbus from the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The first U.S. House of Representatives has scarcely failed a major $700 billion bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all the calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, the desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the grand package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, the Democratic negotiator, had asked deputies to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
“It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet absolutely happened,” he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concerns that the state bailout package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To allow the programme to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers register increasing number of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjunctivity the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more than in the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK Market Research Institute, reservations for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more than in 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed about bookings at 1200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakening dollar price, especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenses are "better computable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive deals, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so the volume of sales compared to last year rose again – although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, decreased.
My example of Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Spa, the beer in a liter jar and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes by designers.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom Bavarian traditional suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: as soon as we’re in the tent, the photographers have already rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos – it’s very flattering especially because I’m at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you make friends.
Cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian outfit to this day was still limited.
But after reaching the Prado de Teresa everything is not for that.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my forearm gets rare glances next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A monk draws my attention to my forearm that was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, the half is virgin, on the right side is compromised, behind is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm hugging from behind to the left.
"It's okay," he says laughing.
The others don’t care much about the subtle methods of flirting and wear hats where it is written “To drink to get dressed!” and show, without asking them, their bare ass.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistically is called Bob, he is from England and is also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which is pronounced with a very long "o".
He tells me after putting his glass of a liter of beer next to him that he just drank.
Put it right next to the fire mouth, most people think that’s a garbage bin.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and can not consume so much alcohol.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, groups of sanitaries run around the party site and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitary facilities appear every time in groups - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered pavements from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You don’t see who suffers from alcoholism and is on the walks.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t do it anymore,’ a health care worker gave me the answer answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of an accident identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey Expands Its Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey tried to become a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that’s what the guides say.
The building is set to hover the end of the platforms and carries in front of two towers, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vault locker has been overcome, there is no doubt as to what the grandeur of the company was that this was the most western door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a “latecomer” in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that was curing to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell below
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was a sabotage.
Since then, the station has been declining and has remained on the brink of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government maintains excellent good relations with Israel and Syria, with both Hamas and Fatah Palestinian factions, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went up to a bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadence of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus
It has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power pastries" where middle-class business managers in business suit - men and women - meet early in the morning to make a deal.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Costume, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask him, "could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "doesn't want to delay that election."
Next, he points out a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far had almost recited to me: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts go back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, for the most part, would be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt on which continent this fascinating country will have to claim.
Life to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (squeeze, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chorus.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 – we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxing, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical escalation, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by anyone – otherwise I’ve often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known warhorses around the world."
We will miss you very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25), he states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research fellowship...at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's, a master's and a doctorate degree."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 1951 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda's supersales
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample habitability, this new monovolume presents an even wider interior space.
To all this are added refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz features a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation was introduced on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter term than the employee by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, the country where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
It is in Japan that nearly a million units of jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends to allow this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 units of Jazz, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
In terms of the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in Honda sales has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a compact five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - that the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in society in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length reaches up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between axes up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
In addition to the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also increases.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the central fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the version with the engine 1.4, since the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Motors are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic achieves a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
This engine - which previously Jazz had 78 horsepower - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and an emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, it now has 100.
This 100 horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To move forward in the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Center at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important are the bee’s composite eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels at a right or larger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can’t be deflected up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require storing information or intuitive logic from previous manoeuvres, so it can run continuously with just a couple of dozens of KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about memory gigas, not even mega.”
This is the first step in developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan will introduce into the series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles in the way.
Tiemble Before Mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to do injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a gentle and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or the mess.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detail.
It’s more a site for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank to spend $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market price.
A week after discovering an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a yield of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the global operation would be based on a unit price of $29, or 28% above its current change.
Morgan Stanley's stock lost 6.79% to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic partnership is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said Juan Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he makes it pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces larger Wall Street names to adopt much more prudent behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for nearly $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s executive director, explained in Tokyo, “we thought the participation would have consisted only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, or at $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
A group spokeswoman, however, declined to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan had had to have eased his balance sheet a lot since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market quote fall by half while the cost of security against a risk of default on its debt rose.
This cost went down last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Re-establishing the republic around 21st-century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, for example from his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished as 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results referring to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, half of the votes and one vote had to be taken.
On Sunday, two polls on the exit of the polling stations and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, estimated at between 63 and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on Sunday night to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly " , he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians leading the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, to be held in full calm, according to the OAS observation mission, referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution entails an increase in the power of the State over the economy, preserving the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially through the extraction of oil by foreign companies and through currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good on arrival at 3:30 a.m. aboard a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no bailout was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell to the power of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since passed from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault the night before dawn.
"A firefight occurred, and they killed half of the kidnappers, the others have fled," the official said.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "blitz" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commands.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We have to recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our secret services, special forces men," he said without going into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six, including the Chadian chief and arresting two.
He also claimed that they were related to a rebel group from Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letras - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture has been held in the headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
It's better that way.
But one sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people gathered in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money lots of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and leaders throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The government of the Netherlands nationalizes a part of Fortis Bank.
The Dutch states - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalisation of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the American market: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution, which also has businesses in Hungary, with a total of 11.2 billion euros.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held high-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s head of economic competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the euro zone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that is occurring in several waves more than a year ago, so decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday morning, the three states will purchase approximately half (49 percent) of the Bank’s property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, including, in particular, insurance activities purchased last year from Dutch ABN Amr<0xC3><0xB3>.
Fortis’ actions began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of a crisis in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees, this bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current prices of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sudden drop in Fortis shares on the insecurity of the US market in connection with the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they didn’t have to worry, they won’t lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there was no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Zorro in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see data on the purchase of medication.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
“There are programs for the protection of personal data, which in all cases combines the use of the data of the recipes with the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the chickenman to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, the designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make depend on the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation from the customer’s health condition and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client for medical check-up and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the client’s diseases and health status.
For example, if you take consistently high doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in the blood is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Many versions of the program circulate, some even set a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to administration has little to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some drugs are multi-purpose, for example, certain substances serve both to treat headaches and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important increased risk factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient’s approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently compiled the results of laboratory tests, and by combining them with drug consumption data, they get more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that entitles the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the individual’s specific approval for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny its approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other mostly global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly on cooperation in nuclear energy.
While the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit started yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President, and Javier Solana, chief foreign policy representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, its trade exchange.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In this way, the existing twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally harmonised, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade treaty with the EU until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi only ranks ninth among the EU’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism—all forms of terrorism—and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urgent, although both sides had a great responsibility for their failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, just as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and production of greenhouse gases should decline by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to impede rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive commissions worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expected to host this edition of more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of goods and cultural activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government in the ceremony of the inauguration of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be a meeting with the press at the Room Struktur in the 5.0 pavilion of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of the publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's missing millionaire found a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett, the missing millionaire on September 3, 2007, were found flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on a 3,000-metre-high plateau in the Nevada Sierra area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
“The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it’s all about what Steve Fossett was flying over on the day of his disappearance,” he said in a press conference.
The commissioner said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) has reported that a squad of investigators has been sent a few hours after the sighting of the remains, who have identified the device: it is the very Bellanca 8kcab, scattered since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for three hours.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the confines of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of primitives.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world's spin in an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world turn by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for flying at 15,445 meters in height, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and certain angles.
This is, in short, Glk the latest born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the starhouse with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of innovation in this sector.
Proprietary for the content outside the traditional, will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that accompany the launch of the Glk SUV, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls from the next 17th of October.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that dominated the central shopping street of Milan, Avenida Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
Who are the Italian Hooligans?
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met with the rival's fans either.
The group is extracted from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (a few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-colored flags showing the militants’ city of origin: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
Inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fans, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the minister of the interior had already controlled them all: among what they had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or identified in the riots.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents the attendance of not only Italian stadiums but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't put any more foot in a stadium.
Luckily!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that others may be added to those few fifty.
“We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way,” the Interior Ministry said.
That’s why “well-open eyes” especially in view of Wednesday’s National game in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ..."
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was previously Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste Public Safety where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that has been shameful.
“I don’t make the sociologist – adds the observatory’s <0x23>1 – the crimes are attributed to the countries in which the fact occurs.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take that into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whispers in Mameli’s hymn: these too are not a crime, but if they allow, they are also not of education.”
