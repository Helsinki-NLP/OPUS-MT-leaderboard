Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters altitude, where many badauds had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners have a hard time finding the money needed to repair the decaying highway infrastructure, many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that sits above your car’s dashboard.
The planes, which record every mile driven by a motorist and pass on information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices to reshape the outdated funding system of major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning has suddenly sparked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you drive, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are not able to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental ride.
This is absolutely essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, the general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles traveled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do so.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay on the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage charge.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to city liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious climate warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Committee on Transport, said that he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay the mile.
“It’s not just a tax smuggling into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that are provided to them.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretary of Transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go in the path of payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
Several states and major cities, however, are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the most important experience in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with an appliance, drivers were worried that the government might follow their slightest facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and that sort of thing are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, ACLU Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily journeys and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now trying to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car drives, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California startup called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It was looking to break into the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she’s testing have liked the big-axis planners because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive ways and far less intrusive ways to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to distrustful citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide “pay-to-drive” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them,” said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners are wondering if the whole debate about mileage payment is not just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund’s bankruptcy by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-off or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so each pays its fair share.
“There’s no need to resort to radical surgery when you just need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listening
The English musician didn’t end up surprised this year.
Starting with The Next Day, which was released in January, he concocted a luxury re-release scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased releases.
Four have already emerged on the canvas.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still count on him to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Not surprisingly, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke is scheduled to re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will come in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously released clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and envelopes, a booklet to share his own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished ones already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on canvas.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a luminous ride that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer looks at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, by the way, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, enchanting, make you want to leave Earth.
In any case, Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man aboard a rocket, potential Martian...
He hides and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is not surprising that he thus has a hand mask in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, by the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All the wounded soldiers are receiving appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
The detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the "universality of service" rule of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to achieve re-eligibility period of 10.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to remain for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universality of the service rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine how wide it can give wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, severely wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted to Parliament last year indicated that out of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required service period to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesman for former fighters, Jim Karygiannis, on Wednesday called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to “this shameful practice.”
Disney Bets on Tablets to Launch An Animated Series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prefer tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its mobile and tablet app.
Its global launch on the Disney group's channels is not planned until 2014, the Disney Junior division said in a statement.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of Callie, the sheriff of a western American city where she rules the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This kind of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms,” he added.
A poll published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in mobile device use by young children in the U.S.: 38% of under 2-year-olds have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of under 8-year-olds, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden Is Ready to ‘Cooperate’ with Germany on U.S. Surveillance Issue
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to deny itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been severely strained as a result of complaints that the NSA had listened to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it should be taken advantage of.
German Green MP Ströbele posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged that the revelation of an inexplicable permanent surveillance system is of public utility.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers might well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the on-demand video service Netflix via their television in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus takes the step of its competitors, like Bell, even though the subsidiary of Cogeco does not yet have a precise date with regard to this new platform.
“You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers currently do not have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its speech to the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for <0xC3><0xA0> la carte services.
“It’s been about two and a half years now that we’ve been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will result in interesting recommendations.
“It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy in terms of television,” Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
In terms of results, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 <0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decrease compared to net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline through amortization costs associated with new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable distributor for $1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet service provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they saw a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
That is $1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of customers fluctuate like this.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very lively competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been spotted in cans of beef-based products, sold by two small, low-priced British retailers, the food hygiene agency said today.
Routine tests have revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained horse DNA at a rate of 1 to 5%.
"Because horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredients list, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that was coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
The traffic had returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines Plans to Pay for Hand Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on the descent of the plane.
The new hand luggage charges relate to the bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
The airlines began paying for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who were trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could in hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in those compartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry less stuff on board.
O’Malley said these new charges won’t really be used to raise money.
It is about making it clear to the most loyal Frontier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's check-in site and procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s hand luggage charges will not be charged before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often gossip about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines make paying expensive enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them have not been affected by the cost of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other carrier imposing such charges is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s hand luggage costs $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the unusual baggage charges imposed by the airline.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth tingling and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “the passengers were on board at the speed of lightning.”
Frontier also makes as Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other major airlines had followed suit.
Frontier’s decision to pay for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown, Denver, but her business is falling apart and she loses money.
Revenue fell 9% and its flight capacity dropped almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to straighten Frontier’s finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an “internal error” and not hackers for its site’s failure
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused its public site to crash for a few hours, and not hackers as some claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a Distributed Denial of Service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in jeopardy, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The NSA, formerly ultra-secret, at the time dubbed the "No Such Agency", has been under the spotlight and has been heavily criticized in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive programs of surveillance of communications at the national and foreign level, and has been leaking to the NSA.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked a lot of speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-City now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors in Montreal on Thursday, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of them, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, we met employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” says Delta Hotel’s Regional Director of Working Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned the building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," said Paul Arsenault, a holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched in the next two years.
According to Titan CEO, “Goodyear Amiens’s acquisition project starts with zero employees”
After throwing up the sponge in January for the partial takeover of Amiens-Nord’s promised Goodyear site, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tiremaker Titan, declares today ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant’s purchase plan in January, you’re back today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, referring to “so-called workers,” who “work three hours” a day, “foolish” unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-face.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the highest paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day while working eight hours in other countries is handicapped in France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the factory shutdown, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let’s imagine that Titan is buying the closed factory from Goodyear.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s current 1,200 employees.
So Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on starting allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the plan to buy the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we plan to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profits are down, as aircraft deliveries and orders are falling
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aeronautics and railroad manufacturer, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft nor information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule before next September.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the test aircraft only flew three times, and then the question arose whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to the forecasts and the stock price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his rating from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential of the stock market to rise in the next quarter or in the next two quarters.
“Although the drop in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far at 177. Potential buyers seem to be waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company’s claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At the moment, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders before commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was progressing according to schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground trials and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans in a different way.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and foresee an update period, and that’s what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the timetable for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slowness of flight tests – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, an unchanged figure compared to December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railroad manufacturer, said the division’s revenues had increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division's order book totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase compared to December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division suffered from some major contract performance issues.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board of directors, fell from 8.5 percent to $4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aeronautical manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, said on Thursday that its quarterly earnings fell by 10 percent.
Two 23- and 27-year-old archaeologists have been missing in a ditch under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned Friday from the Is<0xC3><0xA8>re Rescue Speleo.
They were spotted this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one agueri in practice and the other not, had left underground on Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We have not heard from them since then, the same source said.
“Spellologists should have come out around 5 a.m.,” said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Rescue Spell in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Rescue Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two archaeologists were located.
"This is another group of archaeologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Chambéry Alpine Hunters Battalion were found "depleted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, turned on their feet while waiting for the rescue, the prefecture said.
Powered, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German Journalists Invited to Escape Google and Yahoo
The German journalists’ union on Thursday called on its members to stop using Google and Yahoo’s online services in the aftermath of new revelations about the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using search engines and messaging from Google and Yahoo until further notice,” she said in a statement.
It is “scandalous” the Washington Post reports that the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have gathered masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
“The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union that claims 38,000 members.
Repainted fires: MP calls for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project of "reliefing" the poles of signalling lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday consisting of repainting 16 yellow and blue marking poles of the region.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all Brussels signalling lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamanding" the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Brussels people insanely in operations of relifting the signposts to the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of the Flemish capital," Mr. De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark yellow-blue-black the poles of Brussels.
According to the MP, there is now "no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brussels people deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who runs the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
“To remind you, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels population!” concludes De Bock.
the Pont-de-Buis portico dismantled
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of the tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was diverted into the aftermath.
The decision of dismantling, announced by the prefecture of the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Wednesday, was taken by the company Econov, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports in operation in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of microfibres or an in-ear headphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father had erased himself from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “visit” it.
There is no recipe, no manual for going through the wall of the invisible and finding his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that no longer leaves me, laid on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her empty body, clutched on this bed of hospital bed with ragged sheets.
Likewise, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the meager glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, through small daytime or nighttime appearances, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought which believed itself to be mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost my mother’s person but simply a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who incarnated that person, during her stay in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out," he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it back then.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I was sick...
He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I borrowed my body from him.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my intimacy.
It took a long time, and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it’s too late, just, there’s always one thing that keeps me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes some dreams take me to the contrary and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was lying out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he was smiling at me and happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean to me that he was sharing with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in telling this shared memory lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother was dying of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor that I was at the time.
However, I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I’m in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master in a large school, have not been, with the back, anodized choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades – before she reclaimed France at the time of independence.
The values she inculcated to me are always present, so I get to think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the level of generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes leaning on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, tears that unleash themselves, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time calmed the pain.
There was only the lack, this emptiness without an answer, this need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looking at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes lying on me, I see the incisions that aggravate his gaze, the smallness around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the front days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel its protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, so we gradually learn to smile, and pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when morale is a little reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult moments, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the way she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very much, absence cannot take you away from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008, due to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I was unable to attend his funeral and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I still wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It is soon thirty years since my husband passed away at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The immense punishment that then invaded me has, of course, attenuated but it is still close to me.
Very often it "lands" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that when I wake up I am even sadder to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was doing well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with a voice so real that I woke up jumping, anxious and I lit the bed lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we have been happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I come out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will expand as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it is spreading.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They branded banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide assistance.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation has been jailed.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed to the public.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Assesses
A major defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after compromising his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was dubbed “Bash” and considered by criminals as a “first-rate case,” was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed towards Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bartender dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to illegally obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m, as well as over <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed to the public.
Today, at the Liverpool courthouse, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm located in Blackburn, fell in disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators tracked down the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing the drug, at 60% pure, under the rubbish of the lawyer in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium of Ewood Park, a pregnant Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned to his home, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but refused to use cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a “legal privilege.”
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
In an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that it happened that clients would call him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called for major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “If someone needs to know that they shouldn’t violate the law, they’re a criminal lawyer.”
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying the drug to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the usual limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He prevented the investigation of the police as much as he could to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor her profession, but disrespected her.
He came too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, "Mr Ditta has gone from criminal lawyer to criminal himself since he started procuring drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backstory of the leading members of organized criminal groups who charged him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should adhere to the strictest integrity rules and create a climate of trust among the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of cocaine possession and now obstructing justice, witnessing his commitment to prosecute criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you in court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in the trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session about himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the corridor of death in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin to be back on stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of the Soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board Room of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton Reduces the Cost of Its Christmas Lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered in a coat of light: one could fry the hot blow in Menton with the bill of illumination.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is additionally regulated by taxpayers, and not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport Evacuated After Shooting <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened the fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
He would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the gunman.
The incident would have occurred at terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Soon police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five synets imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, cartoons containing a high dose of humor, allows teenagers to applaud classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d’art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now fills the Chicoutimi Pulperie.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apero lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the competition of the soprano coloration Marie-<0xC3><0x89>ve Munger.
It was a profitable activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of the bat.
Without delivering precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"The finances are in flux and we hope to continue until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a stage we will be going through in seven years," the director said.
“I would say even beyond,” added the CEO, Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, proliferation of threats, carrying weapons in a dangerous design, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
“The rapid responses of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,” Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for collective redress was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time in the oratory of Saint-Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first to Notre-Dame-des-Sneiges by his teacher the brother Sumis, then by his confessor, the father Bernard, at the oratory of Saint-Joseph, where he was born.
The first appeal was aimed at only three establishments, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us: “I was in such a place, can I register?” says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The particular feature of the collective appeal that has just been filed is to allow the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the Sainte-Croix Congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions in question closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal further stresses that the Congregation of Sainte-Croix and the Oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exercised and "exercised the moral, religious and psychological constraints" of the "superiorities".
These last charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Me <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage is carried out, i.e. the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Significant fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a business in Montreal’s LaSalle district on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The rescues were called around 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had occurred in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to master the brazier.
The fire caused "significant damage to the structure of the building," the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux, said.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty housing units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be accommodated temporarily, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical help to die in the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote for the principle of the Medical Assistance to Die in Quebec Bill.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to soothe their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Réseau des cares palliatives du Québec also rejects the bill on medical care to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes Vice President Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
They never ask us, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec’s bill is disorienting the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the lead.
For her part, the Liberal MP from Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan Press Is Angry About Controversial Media Law
“This is a terrifying country and it is legitimate to ask itself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the paper said, challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court “will always be partial because it is an extension of government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament,” he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have “the grip on the media.” The Standard, meanwhile, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had suffered a hard blow” and shook the bill calling it “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a set of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack carried out by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping mall last September.
Kenyan media angered the authorities by broadcasting footage of surveillance cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack robbed the so-called luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following a shield lift in the media.
Under the new bill, the media could be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “deleted” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and picking."
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission on Wages and restored their salaries to about 532,000 shillings per tax-exempt month—which are among the highest in the world.
A Difficult Year for Pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociétés (CSS) in Laval caused a lot of emotion to the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement departures, maternity leave or very short departures, the pharmacy department was found to be highly staff-deficient.
Nearly 30 percent of the staff needed was missing, making this financial year “very difficult,” according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time engaged pharmacist.
There was no recourse to troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
We have streamlined or reduced some of our activities inside the facility to keep things moving.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmacy residents] so that they come and stay here.
There's a contest of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improving the situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain had been fruitful, as the four pupils currently residing in Laval also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now, it’s much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Always Growing Needs
The situation, however, remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is still precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it’s okay.
In the last year, we've had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old model doesn’t start her career in cinema through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and January 8, 2014), captures the erotic memories of a four-year-old who has been addicted to sex since her teens.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her elder is striking: a toaster silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and of Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of the risk: the one who had not hesitated to put naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulfuric situations on a large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their pudding in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before fusing all the bodies digitally: above the belt is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses in their latest cuts, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A CGR room in Narbonne evacuated on Thursday night
Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following sneezing at the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility proceeded with the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters of a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke on the back of a tearful jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the management of the cinema has played the principle of precaution and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything went in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and customers regained the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in pumpkins on Thursday morning at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed into three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokeswoman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that it happened in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics were carried out by Quebec Border Service agents.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range ground-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new raid by the IDF on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to that of July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation of seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine Is Approaching Bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to face its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chance that it will be downgraded again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will guarantee enough foreign currencies to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities massively use to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, the agency is increasingly likely to see a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry at Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country’s economy had suffered its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has been demanding assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which in 2010 granted it a credit of $15.3 billion and has so far only unlocked $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following an unsuccessful new mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "severe external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", while also "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "there is no expectation of improvement in the short term".
“There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year,” the expert said, according to AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international conjuncture.
S&P also highlights the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions the release of opposition Yulia Timochenko.
“Signing the deal would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” S&P said, fearing “trade restrictions” on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
U.S. green light at Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objection from the U.S. authorities to their merger, bringing them closer to the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The merger brings the world’s second agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis, closer together.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry of the review deadline for the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, as envisaged by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups said in a statement.
They said they also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet many of the necessary conditions for the execution of the operation.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory approvals and approval from the shareholders of both groups,” they add.
Congolese army is chasing M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would hunt down M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of northern Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 is about to be beaten after being driven out of the Northeastern localities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it had been controlling since the insurrection began 20 months ago.
"We're going to prosecute M23 and collect it wherever it hides because it's criminals," FARDC spokesperson Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the resorts under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel’s political leader, said on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way alter his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape from the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was redesignated and the army moved on to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” says Congo business expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic – it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it, of military support for the M23, which was made up of former Congolese military mutinies.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, has invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation following the shells that fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the residents of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
“We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would one day be liberated by the military,” said a resident of Uganda.
"We lived in terror [of M23], we are traumatized," he added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus turned out to be negative, the health ministry said.
“The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.”
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being hit after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported on Friday a drop in its quarterly profits due to a drop in its refinery margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in retreat from the group's targets.
Its net profit for the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared with $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment spending increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a downward net profit on Thursday, despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
School Carriage: The Complaint Considered Admissible
From the start of the school year, the Sherbrooke Region School Commission (CSRS) charges a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for pupils receiving the two-residence school transport, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
“There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested,” explains Ms. Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
According to her, CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for an additional time to reflect.
“It’s always better to talk about it, to get together and to find solutions,” says Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu emergency
Faced with the flurry that has been carried out for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "defer the timetable for implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4".
An official request made "to run no risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed to not interfere with the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial guidelines, the closure should still be effective by that date.
Although, in APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
Starting on November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu emergencies will all have received instructions to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, emergency interns will leave room for five general medicine interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The Hotel-Dieu emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4," said Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, chairman of the APHP Medical Establishment Commission (CME), who supports the management project.
“On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means,” confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he said, arguing that SMUR vehicles are on-site on a permanent basis to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on the ground, he also said.
But it is up to the SRA to decide on the closure of the emergency services.
“Things are gradually going on,” Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for which, on November 4, “there will be no change in terms of service rendered.”
“The minister lied to us or we lied to her,” said Dr. Gérald Kierzek.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the campaign against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warning trigger" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
“If the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
But they are regularly suffocated.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at Lariboisi<0xC3><0xA8>re emergencies.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will otherwise have been strengthened.
Both ARS and APHP support the “new hospital model” that has been launched since October 7 and is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of a "permanent outpatient care".
“Where are we going if people are asked to self-diagnose,” asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom “the concept of non-serious emergency” is “dangerous” and marks a “medical regression”.
This is going to be the same as level 3 maternity hospitals.
People are not crazy, they are going to go where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change brackets, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser of Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again reminded on Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there will be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark his clear disagreement, emphasizes Bruno Julliard, his spokesperson.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of transfer to other hospitals.
Obama Ends IMF and World Bank Hearings
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to regain control of the NSA’s listening case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and the World Bank have been monitored by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the issue, a U.S. administration official responded: “The U.S. does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official, he said, had ordered Barack Obama to stop these practices in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one that ended the hearings at UN Headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has imposed new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat world poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began yesterday in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “exceed national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, while toasting them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt with the Portuguese word “we want security” before joining the crowd gathered on the Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been virtually daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangovers since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, backed initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Valley, Eni-Ana-Italy and Ana-Italy.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for the tensions.
The Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering the conflict, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that the deal was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don’t stop arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and Mozambique specialist.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott municipal elections due in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a diseased movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has been decreasing since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to get more votes in the elections.
Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disturbing lightning strikes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangups took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was mistakenly shy when asked if the Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened the government’s frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the leaders of the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultanane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” the author says.
The Legend of Thor might show that "brutal force does not weigh on subtle cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “far too violent, far too scandalous, and in some cases far too obscene to be taught at school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “thin selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “completely distract,” with messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
A fighter from the Hamas Armed Forces was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have said.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they fired an obus shot from an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA Espionage: U.S. Is ‘Too Far Away’, Kerry Admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in terms of espionage, admitted Secretary of State John Kerry, in Washington's first confession in full controversy with Europe about the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, it is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that it doesn't happen again in the future," Kerry said at a conference in London that he attended since Washington on October 31.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of the U.S. diplomacy has long justified intelligence and information gathering practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had since defunct numerous project attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware in advance of these projects,” the head of U.S. diplomacy said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we're trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the secretary of state, who had already expressed himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome, admitted.
He assured on Thursday night that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and that he was re-examining these practices so that no one felt wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, citing documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program dubbed "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the NSA's British counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the fibers used by the giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone, ranging from metadata on emails, text items, or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has intercepted massively data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to comment on it, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would be about "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would not be aimed at Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread on Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also sparked China's ire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his asset master, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club said in a statement.
PSG, the championship leader ahead of Monaco in the difference of goals, released the list of players retained for this 12th-day match, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of his left knee at the beginning of the month when he returned from his selection.
A Ceremony in Memory of the Cremated Dead
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the cremated dead in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Hall, will attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals on funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click on the above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book The Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, a philosopher and vice-chairman of the National Committee for Funeral Ethics, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also “symbolic violence”, which means the “delete of the singularity and distinctive signs” reduced to the “anonymity” of the ashes.
Why is what is readily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivize Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited attempts to appease it.
It is for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nerard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to envision for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the surrender of the ashes," Michaud-Nerard observes.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect him with others, to evoke him, to make sense of his death, to organize the farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of Father Lachaise, since 1998.
The masters of ceremonies are often people who have converted.
There are also some former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several memorial ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who were cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted online, to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation due to rats turns to the controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their ground floor apartment in the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Terres du Sud Habitat Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, according to Joël Canapa, the Director of the Office.
There have always been rats in the cities.
The degradation company carries out two passages per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been carried out.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats don't pull into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, degradation products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, one is not going to kill a child.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defends the family father who left his home to settle at the hotel.
We are soon out of stock and are expecting a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Ends Down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house ravaged by flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames broke out in a three-storey four-storey house located behind the cour du Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent at the time of the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
“So the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it’s buildings stuck here,” said France Loiselle, spokesman for Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has persisted over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners have emerged at Carolines, and had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of Stand Up for Heroes, a comedy and music evening for veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Bill Coswart and Jon Stewart will be present.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival went through non-traditional circuits, featuring for example shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a wired channel ("The League" on the theme of FXX's happily lascivious fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was featured on the Saturday Night Live show and was part of the cast of the Parks and Recreation series, but she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young voice actors (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The appointment takes place at the City Hotel, in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he went down a alley between two buildings and said to himself, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
Oil Price Continues to Fall and Approaches to $96 a Barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing China’s electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. crude for December delivery dropped from 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late-morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The plentiful supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to solidify after growth bounced back to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
The Brent crude, a reference for the international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Discussing the Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal in Texas has reinstated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a first-instance judge this week.
This judgement means that a law passed in July in that State and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal's ruling means that doctors who will practice IVGs will have to have an "admission privilege" from local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, under his or her status as a nursing member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state clinics because these clinics failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court of first instance had ruled on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to annul the first-instance ruling that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a strong return on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show on the date?
Some 10,000 candidates appeared at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored during this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide choice of herbal singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want performance, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few have found their account.
There are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court Blocks Decision on NYPD Control and Excavation Policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed her from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decision was suspended until the end of the appeal brought by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change its policy and the training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday regarding the request for suspension.
The appellate court said the judge should be dismissed from the case because she violated the judge’s code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men of Hispanic origin as part of their program of control and excavation.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy, training and oversight reform, and has ordered the implementation of a pilot program to test body-carrying cameras in the areas where the largest number of controls takes place.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and excavation have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and excavation system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks mainly involving black men of Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was initiated in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Supporters advocating changes to the NYPD’s surveillance and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, would be a waste of money, and would not solve the broader problem of pressured police forces after police personnel have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that it did not end the constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pay an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us they were going to tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for $100,000 fireworks, $4 to $5 million in land in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the elysée kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the chef climbed all the steps until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed an incalculable number of greats of this world in a quasi-anonymous that he only broke today, at the time of retirement, at 60.
The man with an open face, detachable skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!" says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Do not dislike the heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all gourmet," gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had “a slightly more developed appetite”.
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the lost pounds before the presidential campaign, has “no specific regime request.”
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the State dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch to the heart.
He said praises.
“The human side has come out,” he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been in the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Québec
A historic house built in 1850 was the looting of flames in Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-story building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three fire alarms at the fire department.
The fire was declared at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burnt house house housed four dwellings, but no tenant was on the premises at the time of the fire.
Damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis from a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese leaves out some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decoil you in his role as a degenerate trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a “Long Island Stock Exchange courier who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in an extensive corruption case on Wall Street.”
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort went up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that follows.
Without limits, man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of any kind are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that brought them together on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its installation too long.
It looks like the movie lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor-in-chief Andy Coulson reportedly used “telephonic piracy, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a snail on a link involving then-executive Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawby, her “beautiful special counsel.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, with hacking Pawby’s voice box and “permanently planting in front of his door,” but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people’s house hoping to surprise them, it’s the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they’re saying about it,” E said.
He said NotW was using three ways to investigate the issues: phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of phone piracy?
He says otherwise, but we say, “Of course we do.”
Rumors of a liaison involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawby, said she was told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, which recorded pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire’s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that involved Ms. Pawby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Ms. Pawby’s slightest facts and gestures.
In a voicemail he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having hacked the phone.
Barack Obama Receives Iraqi Prime Minister in the Face of Violence
The US president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking U.S. assistance in combating the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq had its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 were injured.
The United Nations is even higher with 979 killed and 1,902 injured.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new embrace as neighboring Syria is preying on a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead on the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fueled this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “world war” against Al Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be welcomed by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise of ending military engagement in this country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased meetings with the executive, and Congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he advocated for the international community to wage a “third world war” against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased assistance to Iraq in terms of security is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian politics".
They also demanded Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing Accuses Uyghur Group of Tiananmen Attack
China’s Homeland Security chief accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in central Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, eclipsed the crowd on the famous square of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of Homeland Security, accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, fueled by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing has been organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, his remarks being taken over by the Chinese news agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin and said his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained gasoline-filled containers and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a large survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests take care of gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States.
A spokeswoman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate manner to probe parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last fief of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, or a few hundred fighters, were cut off at an altitude of nearly 2,000 meters on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba, who was reached by phone at around 12:30 a.m., told AFP.
“The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit,” he added, “it seems that the DRC’s FARDC armed forces have pushed back the rebels a bit.”
According to the witness, wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had “passed the night” in Jomba before going to the front for a “scattering operation.”
We heard very clearly behind him crepitations fed with light weapons.
From Bunagana, the political fiftieth and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the UN Mission to Stabilize the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with the FARDCs "circling the residual M23 positions to delegate them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but has provided decisive intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-stocked with ammunition, were heading for the front line.
They were armed with Kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, civilian-assisted military personnel loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, in order to ensure the queue of another vehicle piling M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" under penalty of being disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December with no results at the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is only up to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signing," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the movement back to the DRC that had set off in the morning turned at midday.
“This morning we crossed over to go to our fields, but the military told us to back off,” Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
We have the impression that the shootings are getting closer to the population.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Musical comedy, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It’s a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's opera rock, most attempts would be avoided in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or The Miserables bore the aura of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes maneuver the titles as successful tubes.
The first one takes over, this Christmas, her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, “Beauty and the Beast” could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put themselves at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard-won.
How do French musicals evolve?
The supply has multiplied in number.
First, there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the wishes of the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Bastille Lovers.
Others make a fifteen-year-old leap back under the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
Then we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Spring Awakening" are hard to finance.
Do we have enough talented artists like singing, playing and dancing on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical performances in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The level of talent is as high as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre intended for adults and not for young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality and what it produces as ephemeral stars.
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the enthusiasm of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a province Zenith.
The mayonnaise went up in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning around 5:30 a.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car has been hit by a ghost driver, who is harmless to her.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9 a.m. at the scene of the accident, as long as the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause bottlenecks as the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be deflected by this outlet/inlet of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It has been closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares for new assault
Children are playing on a carbonized armor belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, on October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing for another assault on the last M23 rebel strongholds near Bunagana in eastern DRC on Friday.
The goal is to move the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on its own.
There will be only Runyonyi Hill left.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Fief political and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been cut off at an altitude of almost 2,000 meters on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by fighting the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three other people were injured, one of whom was severely evacuated by the FARDC, the witness cited by AFP added.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have given no account of the loss of human lives.
NSA Reveals Increasing Business Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany, at low altitude.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began revealing his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever provoked paranoia among companies over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that flooded the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the U.S. poses a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all of Mr. Snowden’s documents, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on trade secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the EU's lack of adequate computing and internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them.
“It’s not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of US espionage agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock to some companies who so far thought that China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members have renounced their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. data exploration program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you assure me that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed as part of the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are usually not inclined to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case it leaves the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long marred the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB stick at a trade show or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the automotive manufacturer Audi, says collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they can not be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV in Germany advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during their trips abroad due to the risk of affecting the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of having committed acts of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a Georgian teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son has been murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a mat rolled up in his high school gymnasium, think their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th stuck in a rug leaning behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
Investigators at Lowndes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family disputed the findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics and common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for their son’s death.
“They sent their son to school with a cardboard and we returned it to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he brings up elements of a nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video images contained clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC Issues Child Allergy Advice for Schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines released by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has climbed sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize teachers and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used branded auto-injector EpiPen – in order to be able to respond quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something is tingling on my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on the one hand is infuriating in public by convoking the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and on the other, prohibits the flight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on its board of Edward Snow?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other, a condemnation of the listeners of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be such a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks takes its toll on U.S. diplomacy’s analysis of political or other issues around the world, we do consider that, in the eyes of U.S. power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be outraged by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Is it possible to deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The introduction of powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been formally justified by the fight against terrorism for the past ten years.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on an almost daily basis, which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - it has already been said - Americans can give information to French people about other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to provide themselves with interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of the free access to access.
What are the risks of the U.S. degrading its image?
We've got to report them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies — and this has been the case recently — learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. service providers subject to U.S. law, and therefore to the grip of the NSA.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations initiated by media around the world, which contributes to sparking a debate on intelligence surveillance practices so far virtually non-existent, could push lawmakers, including the US, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children may choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register an “unspecified” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, bruised and stabbed.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual developmental disorders, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, and then wait and follow up on the child’s psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time or clearly challenging.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hair, breast and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and prejudice-driven crimes.
Young boys of the non-compliant gender now have camps that are specifically intended for them.
Australia and Nepal are already authorizing adults to register male, female or “third sex” sex on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized “neutral” after winning her appeals that allowed her to keep a “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this deeply Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school books.
The American Catholic Online website also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be assigned to babies at birth.
“The role of parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just about a decade ago, the medical community considered gender as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But now, there are many who question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment as he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He coined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as being male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a blunt circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and raising him like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “always repeat this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say, “[they] are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really tell if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones when she was 12 years old.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found was horrifying to him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to grow.
After learning the truth, he again became a man, following a testosterone treatment and having his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general manager of California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labelling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex appellation.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
The German law applies to the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at this age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammography radiologist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law will "responsible" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or foster mothers.
“The law leaves some latitude to parents so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a deadline before enrolling in “male” or “female”.
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what is needed,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels most comfortable – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta says his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote approaches to dissolve Silvio Berlusconi from his term.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the center-left leader said he had “closely intended” to continue ruling with his coalition until the next 2015 legislative elections.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Council President convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his resignation.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People for Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last his refusal to cede to the orders of Berlusconi who already wanted to overthrow the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the tragedy claimed to have responded to a call stating "multiple wounded".
"Law forces are on the spot," the airport said on its Twitter account, as TV footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed one person evacuated on a branch card, and a second person transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 at the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times states that teminauts 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in the Gaza Strip
Israeli tank shells killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant on Thursday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, health services sources said, according to Reuters.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the region as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar shelling.
The Israeli army has just referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's Campaign Considered to Drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest of secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and told Thursday night that close collaborators of the president had conducted “in-depth group work and end-2011 polls” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaigners and the White House, former White House Secretary-General Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice-President could have on the former Secretary-General's clerkship.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been blatantly kept inside the Chicago campaign headquarters and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were like, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley called the review “concert,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial when voting.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on surveys and discussion groups unless they are seriously considering taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of any change, the former secretary-general admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama did not know that Biden's expulsion from the presidential list was being considered.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first fluorescent ice based on honey.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent collation.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on honeycombs and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, as the ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something incredible but we’re just starting out in terms of production, and 2g of that stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at pH-neutral.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice begins to shine.
We’ve been testing it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice I have created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
The company at Charlie’s experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of honey synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist passed away last Sunday, at the age of 71.
“He died on Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands as a musician cracking the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the last few years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the great joy of living that he had.”
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013 : In Figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more energetic.
In the last two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I certainly won’t do it again this year.
But the statistics show that I'm the galley sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I’m looking forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men in Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't glide.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, succulents, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go on candy hunts in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, not tell stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet come to clear.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you pissing on that your friends put on Facebook and that you can’t take off and on which a guy you like leaves a good style.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Luckily for us, the “chicken baby trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these potatoes and didn’t have to sit inside.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that gently float on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a “bad bank” structure with <0xC2><0xA3>38 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% within the next two years and hopes to have fully cleared it within three years.
RBS also said it would file a provision for the depreciation of additional dubious claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a write-up related to the formation of the canton structure.
RBS also clarified that this internal restructuring would release <0xC2><0xA3>10 to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion of capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow to draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of meddling in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, take care of the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer and for the UK,” said Ross McEwan, the new CEO.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has baquet seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options are improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The fans of rallies that join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are truly pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of the raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters went down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from a certain death.
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve him safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's Denholme, West Yorkshire, career to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career after a serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with sharp eyesight walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Department ransacked the site and came down as a reminder to save Ruby by using an animal shed to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical aid specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It’s amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical aid specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get out of it.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was driven to the veterinarian for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified watching the rescue.
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and she had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were exhausted.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a chorister on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dredged me when I was 18.
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he “definitely denied making progress to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question Turkmen Islamist movement
"Backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the head of Chinese security told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after Monday’s attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominant region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gasoline cans against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and killed 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car.
The Etim, which declares to be fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among Al Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Breaking Europe Gives Scots a Choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to be able to join the EU.
And that's what we hear about passport control stories in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde’s journal indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and this was to be foreseen).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend a great deal of their time circumventing their formal rules when it comes to them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so ancient that it is now stuck: I heard for the first time the rumor that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet one interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a dead end.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties that oppose the EU or who are campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and brought out the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the carcass weighing on national economies through membership in the single currency, has led many people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that are experiencing excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system weighs on its members favorable exchange rates for German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are faced with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a detrimental disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt, especially in France, becomes one of the EU’s great leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling to thrive.
The result: the far-right Marine Le Pen party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the Socialists back to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single anti-European and anti-monetary bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties make good appearances in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-money sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something more like a free Europe of Nations (sovereign) favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope that it will soften the eyes of the United States.
Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific, however, suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending a stroll through Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and preserve our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and it is noteworthy – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Conservative Chancellor of the Labour Chess, Alistairling.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Aging Early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts Think The Obesity Epidemic Could Be A Trigger Of Early Puberty
The tendency towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair begin to grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, that doesn’t indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Evident signs of development, such as bustling breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance from the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half years, compared to 12 three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years for the first rules to appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first rule and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their rules.
“They’re afraid of the risk of pregnancy or even the way they’re going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She returned from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are several explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend toward true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Homage to the Coen Brothers folk
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been retrospectived at the French Cinematheque, had won the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their debut on the upcoming American film star, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where the music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich atours in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less radiant clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing-in to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" recounts over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
It accepts back-to-back foot replacements in studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An Air of Documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of misfortune, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist but integrates, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel and several Oscar awards.
If Llewyn Davis didn’t exist, the two filmmakers, fans of folk music, built their story on real figures of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk writes.
The film then takes on the look of documentary, from the 33T invading dusty music label inhabited by an invaluable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who constantly crosses the film: a beautiful red cat with a crackling look, Llewyn Davis’s fortune companion.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grand in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is needed to be “regarded as good,” “accident can also launch someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He'll never know the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, just published his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times named him "the author of espionage novels who knew too much".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Reduced physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“Without a doubt, between 120 and 150 million countries are all confused,” he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment in a building on Foch Avenue, a few steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated.
“Not to mention pirate editions,” he added, referring to a pile of books on the table between the bronzes or ivories reported from the 130 countries to situate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman on the advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a silvery Austrian aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, sets himself in the shoes of all the evils of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
“I never pretended to be a literary author,” explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don’t send a message.
He worked “like the great pre-war reporters, the Albert London type, who went on site and came back with real and long investigations.”
SAS's father said "make some sort of geopolitical leaflet."
“I’m constantly on my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave,” added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often preconceived: thus, a month before the attack of a Syrian regime command center having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "The Madness of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan uprising.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in “The Cairo Conspiracy,” a year before the assassination.
In October 2012, in “Panic in Bamako,” he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I am not guessing, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I just make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM Marguerite typewriter "whose parts have all been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with a pen.
On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
As Gérard de Villiers once said, “Malko Linge, like all heroes, is of no age.”
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than me.
Airplanes are arguing about the width of seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages between major aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The conflict concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as the airliners sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record order at the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way seats will be arranged in the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its redesigned “777X” will be able to accommodate in economy class 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often exchange shots on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls it directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to take a step above its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the start of a new advertising war with the financiers presenting a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, titled “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ chief commercial officer.
As dietary habits change, people get bigger, but seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American's weight from 40 to 49 years old increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American's height of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study that indicates that an extra inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus’ figures on seating widths and states that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not just depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and enabling them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business,” said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don’t want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more a matter of having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a matter that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first pointed out in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engine models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in 9 rows.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to break more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at European airliner Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines have to choose.
Aircraft vendors who are traveling around the world take even one meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While waiting to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus underlined the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider side seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern appliances, experts say it is unlikely that his call to the aerospace industry in order to put in place a size standard for seats will end, but that it could make the 777X sales wave forget about.
The shareholders of Oracle irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle’s shareholders voted against the proposed remuneration for founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the group’s financial performance.
The vote is not binding, but comes to smear the image of Larry Ellison, the world’s third-largest fortune just aureolate from his boat’s victory in the America’s Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his salary.
Oracle’s boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but he collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire 2013 fiscal year, Oracle’s net profit increased by 3.5%, while the stock exchange rate rose by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index, which took 24% at the same time.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Eliminate Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Other tests are needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from getting his nicotine dose.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated were “soothed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that the levels of antibodies remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into factories to antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t have any fun because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that could help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times already in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in the strike, which was being carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been started with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied he had changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to see if Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a café, after their expiration in August 2005, without any appeal.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony from Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government put pressure on leases to be the subject of a tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which reported to the Obeids about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government policy in terms of leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
“Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't about that.
At least not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says a senior official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official told Fox News.
The official did not specify the target, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers holding a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently studying the possibility of introducing a “authenticity” test for foreign workers holding a 457 visa as it plans to extend repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diverted means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working document was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Failureful statements about ‘foreigners returning to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labor market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being considered.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see “if the job offer is authentic in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsors it.”
Businesses could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's troubled nine-year-old son was travelling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “bring the UK together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the duration of travel to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unequivocally” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for everyone and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
The rules regarding the use of electronic devices on board remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to loosen regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in “aircraft” mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do important work to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations regulating the use of electronic aircraft,” she said.
The issue is governed by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety on a permanent basis and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said that it is complying with the current rules for the time being.
“According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to immediately change that,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and its reasons.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, carry-on baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fighting
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a grouping of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was turbulent on the Pia side where a riot involving several people broke out on the Post side.
At least four minor injuries should be reported.
Alert, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the injured are taken care of.
Singapore Gathering Lenders Take Advantage of Mid-Class Forced To Tighten Belt
Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings from a lender at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay for her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is so high in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third gage lending company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Securing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore’s mortgage lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local fund maker with a branch in the same mall.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not applying for creditworthiness or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders on loan as families feel pressure from rising cost of living and over-indebtedness from households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to mortgage lenders to fill the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing debt of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt/gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the pay scale] are looking to complete their income as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have caused people to rush to put their personal effects at risk to touch the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items stored in the city-state’s 200 gage lending stores are in gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s put the grandma’s gold chain on hold and we’ll get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest lending shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The rise is such in the gadget lending sector that ValueMax, a store operator in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says its CEO, Yea Lee Ching.
The company will fund them using 60 percent of the $66 million it raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have erased criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that the mortgage offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but also that it does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers are mortgaged on property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt,” she says.
Garment is increasingly socially well-accepted as a means of securing short-term financing.
The people who go to the mortgage lenders are not just the ones who have financial problems.
Well-kept people in Singapore also go to the ValueMax gage lending stores to gage gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be easy-going people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who need cash to get through a difficult path,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes, they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was serving, says deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and do not have access to the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He went to the supermarket in Nazi uniform before being chased out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform bared by a bracelet with a wide cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, the store said Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to rescue her, but "by the time she arrived, he had already left without scrambling," she added.
I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People had a bad mouth.
“You don’t go out on the street like that unless you wanted to get attention,” Rosina Rusin, a 60-year-old client, told Cambridge News.
The incident took place on Thursday, the day of Halloween, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to tell if it was a cannula.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing an SS black bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda,” Dutton said, explaining that he was suffering from “mental problems.”
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the faltering health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, high rates of chronic diseases and systemic constraints.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania’s independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our opinion, will address the unique difficulties facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for non-scheduled clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services, and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to care for Tasmania’s health system,” said Plibersek.
The Minister said that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and to prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless it is followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for help it had submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton, the spokesman for the health opposition, believes today’s announcement is a “solution of fortune.”
“The reason we are here is that the state’s Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government pulling out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in $300 million, and pretending it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the era, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons Production Capacity, Surveillance Agency Says
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are being stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived one day in advance of the deadline of the
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for the destruction of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Due to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which tracks the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, there were an estimated 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country due to the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups from the Al-Qaeda network, to Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but did not give any details.
The fighting underlined the importance of the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a civil war that lasts, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OAC, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was “now pleased to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all of the critical production declared and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that “no other inspection activity was planned for the time being.”
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to security concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the IOC said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which have been inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that ICAO inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the IAEA Executive Committee.
“I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said OIAC Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of al-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been a sharp explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence pronounced against one of the bombers in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted with anger to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an executioner.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most sought-after men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing the explosives used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass killings for two nightclub attacks in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He has also been found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for a life sentence, but they could have asked for the man, dubbed “Demolition Man” for his reputation as an expert in bomb manufacturing, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions committed by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“It should be dragged to the execution platoon,” Ms. Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew up an explosive-laden backpack just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was “dead” three times while on respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have had the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces would kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to restore links between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was ridiculing the grief that he might have caused to other people.
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Corteen.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronics to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk on their mobile — under the highly anticipated new guidelines released by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect any immediate changes to be made.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to comply.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic aircraft on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve a broader use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them again until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their planes when the plane lands before landing and not re-light them until the plane has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground-rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for this – it will be beneficial for everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room supervisors” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was driven out of a plane by American Airlines after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones is the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national expert on transportation safety on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to pose a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to address the problem last month recommended that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so intentionally.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Planes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those pushing for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader line plane and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicating that the aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low-visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for tech-equipped travellers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helitrulled bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helitrulled after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water jet was lifted aboard a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was brought back to life by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue center.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This swarm of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird has managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The water snail was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and employment creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, companies and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting caught up in the long and difficult process of reforming European institutional arcanas.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy points – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders think that control of these key skills should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits it has to be part of the European trade area – 40% of the large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Lastly, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives to change the treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on a “significant change” that brings power back to the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding to change the treaty and better represent Britain’s interests would see a 16% turnout in favour of retaining the country in the EU during a referendum.
The prime minister should not doubt a single moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will represent a significant change in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in the UK, and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not deviated from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of invited children in the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passing of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the festivities have recovered.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned for last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, which transits most of the Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, if you count three other small nearby islands.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutinists of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutinies, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on London's generosity.
The Council of the island unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, who is resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The establishment of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor them, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already conduct the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, neighbouring Pitcairn.

Life in prison for former Chinese Vice-Governor
A former vice-governor of the province of Jilin, in northeastern China, was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuan of wine pots, according to official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and managers get contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing’s first intermediary court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the inferior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP chief in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has in no way expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were accused of sexual assault on children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate, stressing, “external YMCA controls were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions during a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord’s flaws in child safety.
Staff testified that they had observed some flaws, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them private, had them sit on his knees, told them he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah's child care officer, Jacqui Barnat, who framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director-General said that he rejected the staff ' s testimonies that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had disrupted their judgment, which meant that they did not report his actions.
Hare said he had expressed his view before the New South Wales YMCA board saying that, for the organization, the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not concern “reporting” by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was taken by the YMCA Director General in charge of Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He noted that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his views known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it’s likely to happen, so...”
When many equestrian events experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland win, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three tours with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are of the same size – were hailed for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to make his 2-year-old Toffee pony ride around the track.
Fenton has been hailed by judges for his natural qualities of dressage uncommon for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his pony Shetland every day.
Her mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo.”
They stood up against and against all, but both smashed the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it."
He ran the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he’ll definitely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll do a nice performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They are a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he had a really proud look.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be remanaged”
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be remanded, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted pots of wine to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete redesign,” the regulator said.
The order of "redesign" comes from the administration of Guangdon for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The drafting of New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to “impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.”
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a full reorganization of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation of the people responsible at New Express and immediately reorganize the newspaper’s management team.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published a call on the front page for his release twice, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
“In this case, I have hurt Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I've realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several major suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year banning authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a row.
The leak of radioactive steam detected at one of the two nuclear chauffeuries of Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royal has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in the naval defense, assures that its crews and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failed heater.
“Everything is being done so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” DCNS said.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not question the program of activity of the nuclear-powered ship."
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier comes out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had set up Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify the young pilots of the hunt.
A "little crash", confined to the reactor's confinement area, had then occurred on the French fleet's admiral ship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs never ending.
In short, unrestricted siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we do not bother with the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of ducks: cultural centre deficit, strong subsidies to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to the private enterprise or demolished.
It is also naive to observe the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such companies, but in the private sector based on consumer demand.
The citizens were happy to learn that the lakes at Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large decline in population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We’ve been run for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for the most part and I don’t think a sheep farmer is doing any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging on an equivalent length to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, were working as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railroads that started from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British Police Issues Extradition Order Against Assange <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a "disclosure notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible ways under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "has issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man asking him to appear at a police station, on the date and time of his choice," a spokesperson said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the release of the notice by the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks fighting against classified information.
How Biometrics Invaded Our Lives
Finished the passwords to type to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French, or Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a world as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission for Informatics and Freedoms authorized 774 fingerprint, hand shape or hand venous network recognition systems in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will build on new techniques, which will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours, and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
“For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable,” says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: sometimes the procedure needs to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for some 20 years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the computational capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture’s R&D Labs in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and infallible marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” says Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is who they claim to be).
The identification thus far concerned the issue of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be confronted with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to overwhelm someone else’s identity.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We are retrieving the images from the surveillance cameras and comparing them to the photos of celebrities circulating freely on the Internet,” says Dany Nassif, head of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: take a photo of a guy who is queuing in a store, track his progression through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence checks have been added.
“A biometric tip avoids the phenomenon of a friend pointing for another,” says Accenture’s Cyrille Bataller.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the key of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoul<0xC3><0xAA>me by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and wholesalers: when paying in store with his bank card, the customer does not tap his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash for thirty seconds less, it’s appreciable,” explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you bespoke options.
And finally, rest assured by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if one tries to move it,” says Philippe Robin, Thales.
But, due to the lack of in-depth study, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
The specialists in the protection of privacy, they, continue to worry.
“The advances in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me afraid of the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted with an almond of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be carried between his legs.
In Colchester's Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his permit resulted in a 6-month withdrawal of permits.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
A Tax on Foreign Property Owners to Explode the London Bubble
The Treasury has provisionally enumerated the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, registered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2M and an annual fee for individual buyers who choose to hold more than one property in the framework.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million for fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West, and Hu-Yorkshire.
Mr. Cook said: “As a result of the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are being imposed independently of the effects of the outdated housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy real estate in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the thriving sector located southwest of London that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Central London’s prices show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a fast-growing domestic market, the city’s south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) experiencing a rebound, according to Savills’ studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog’s tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved their tail more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers tracked animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals’ heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to traverse the tail movement and present it as going further left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog with no expression moving the tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail diverting mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or shouldn’t worry about.
He added: “If you meet other dogs several times and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Sciences, said it was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the dog species.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turned their heads left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs walked more easily toward a robot dog when his tail leaned to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He pointed out that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the films or the robotic dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many elements, detected in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after its singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield’s band was scheduled to perform Friday in the downtown concert hall The Hydro.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramm the show.
The announcement came after the group was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will nominate his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest-ranking men in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so it belongs to a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said a meeting of all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony in which bishops will be raised to the dignity of a cardinal, known as a consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of electing cardinals will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope generally appoints as many cardinals as it takes for the number of elective cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
The composition of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favor Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world in charge of examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope had decided on his own.
“From now on, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “absolutely possible” that Francis sought advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities as cardinals, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair the seating record
General Motors Co. recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to resolve a problem with manually tilting records, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. body responsible for vehicle safety regulations.
On some pickups, the front seats may have a fault in the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the records do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury,” according to a statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
Deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owners' newsletter due to the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Worker Died Buried Under Concrete Blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 a.m., on Rue Marquette, near the intersection of Rue Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
It is probable that work on the foundations had been going on at this place for some time.
A wall of Mitoyan foundation had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the moment when the victim had just arrived at the site in order to retrieve his tools.
I was passing by by car and saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that would cover it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers have been attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The cry of desperation of an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice, believing in the possibility of a change.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts out of obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at the Harvard School of Medicine.
I’m reading a very sad book these days.
This is a book that I thought would encourage me during the slow second year of medicine and give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients’ medical records in the evening and I went to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory, and newsjournalists took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82% of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide any explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the interrogation of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s misdeeds.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the excess of authorized spending during the presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is unpredictable, because the political opposition party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the administration's choice.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that didn’t seem to allow us to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term free from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had been hearing for so long.
Yet, while the favourable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me wish for the many promises that have been fulfilled.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Prime Ministers.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are five years from now, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on the street of Retinne in Fléron.
The rider, Jonathan, 26, of Fléron, did not wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescuers, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, who contests the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has raised this argument in an attempt to rule out issues related to a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially stated that Palmer won the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a redesign of the voting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can enter, enter your contact details into a computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined the possible options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward, except the history reward because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society have identified a new species of crustacean dolphin off Australia’s northern coast.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific missioner at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns for L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Is the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprising to you?
That's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
While in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
Moreover, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or affiliation of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are being challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two very morphologically close species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific cubic dolphins and Atlantic cubic whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only at this place.
Therefore, if a massive mortality problem caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we may be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than the local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the Sousa chinensis species, whose population of the new discovered species came from, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This brewing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems favor genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than knowing what lives in the Marianne pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it’s high time that this changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global regulators’ investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of the world’s largest financial market surveys, where US$5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the enlarging investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had forwarded email and instant messaging files, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash exchange trading at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been the subject of any accusations.
Mr. Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks have been looting instant messaging and emails sent over the years to find cases of defamatory acts.
News about these surveys have shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year due to the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of highly liquid currencies, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at a slow pace”.
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange fund office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was under control,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation into mayor Rob Ford has been rigged, says a lawyer
After police had confirmed that they had hand-picked a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation "so smeared".
Ruby said she believed in The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver Alexander Lisi, 35, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they had also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby called it "unexplainable" that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put his phone on the line, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr Ruby's remarks an "obvious and desperate attempt" to make a claim to the media in a case that did not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges down to mid-term, except London
With the exception of London, major European stock exchanges are declining on Friday at mid-term, led by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious as they believe the US Federal Reserve could unleash its policy of quantitative easing sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street’s futures predict an opening of rising U.S. stocks after two consecutive rebound sessions.
In terms of values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, leaded by the warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing downturns this morning and announcing the creation of an internal default structure (“bad bank”) of 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (<0x2B>2.45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press release that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at next week’s meeting.
We are anticipating a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues its decline against the US currency and hit a two-week low of $1.3517 in session.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market in reverse.
The Supreme Court approves Obama's Health System Reform Act
A great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the law on health care reform ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the authority of the government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and further considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be reduced to a penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including nominee Mitt Romney, vehemently opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to former combatants in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet Cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the dead of all wars this Friday afternoon.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military quarters of the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian Hanging on the Gaza Border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening during a violent siege on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip’s only power plant stopped operating on Friday after its fuel stocks were depleted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority (PAE) said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas Armed Forces branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shelling during an Israeli army incursion east of the local Khan Youn<0xC3><0xA8>s source, in the south of Ganza.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were found dead when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later on.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer raided a hundred metres into the territory before withdrawing thereafter.
The confrontation lasted for half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and destined, according to the army, to "terrorist activities."
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, specifying that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
Israel has also hit an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles intended for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Officials of the Israeli government have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard Wednesday morning at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a back wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre Maisonneuve, it advances, profiled, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a line of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and the face discovered, waiting on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in solo relays, in a unisson group (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs its own sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, put online at the forefront.
This is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, drums and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance floor, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a portion of Michaux’s poem, monocord and monotonous in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This long, energetic, sound discharge, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as those hairs that get thicker or these black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, has imposed herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt’s shapes, open up a broader and giboyeous imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers chopped by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
Gymnopedias, after the extract, are richer.
The scene is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers gathered to play the scores.
Their awkwardness in music, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, couples go into love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Also familiar to Chouinard, bouffons appear with the red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnages, fugitives or players.
The gesture, the laughter and the small screams beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the coitus bodies, the beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the scene when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotize, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce into a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of lawsuits regarding Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, launched a lawsuit on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it slammed at the pole during the patent auction that took place after Nortel went bankrupt.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in relation to search terms on the Internet, the findings of the trial, which is the heart of Google’s business.
It was not possible to join representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones that run Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million bid for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offering several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market based in part on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar claims more damages and interests against Google, as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is persistent, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater causing the explosion
Grandma allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion at a house in Gesves, which injured two seriously on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, was caused by a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the King's deputy prosecutor said Friday night.
The expert on-site dispatched by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and accumulation of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was by his side and was lightly burned.
"The two victims were intubated and long packed on the spot before being taken to the CHU in Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge, by helicopter, by ambulance to him," Mayor José Paulet said.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remaining intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the President of OPCW.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of inauguration to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier.
In his investiture before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the Court’s 18 black-robe judges whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been in the process of reorganizing the Muslim Brotherhood, a group that has been considered to be a fundamentalist for more than 84 years.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acclaim the new president and, standing out from the presidential fast of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the very busy streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered to be the uncharismatic "relief wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 Mo'rakita uprising.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and a red tie, addressing the judges present in the hall decorated with woodworks where he took an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem as he placed himself on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song “The People and the Army, Hand in Hand...” sung by thousands of people gathered in the university’s large amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fif of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime in Mubarak last year started, and vowed to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former ousted president, took over.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows down to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the growth of the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by manufacturers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major manufacturers in Detroit showed double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was estimated to be 15.3 million, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he believes that this slight brake blow is primarily explained by “the government’s ‘shutdown’ and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fifteen of the month.”
GM, however, reported an increase of nearly 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, up from 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
Meanwhile, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11 percent increase in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, up from 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have lower sales than the consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, the GM stock was gaining 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford was yielding 1.1%.
Renault plunged into stock market by warning from Nissan
Renault on Friday blamed the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had lowered its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a revision, also announced a redesign of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a trading official from a Paris broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer owns 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots fired by two people aboard a motorcycle that was passing in front of a neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn local in the western suburb of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of the Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police from the counter-terrorism service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, were accused of participating in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's call rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, saw his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for his club's next two Champions League games, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Deported to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for a shot at Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity across the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the black, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large Montréal region is also experiencing a lot of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 private households of electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its upward net profit forecasts and expects record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current projections are met, this will represent a growth of 12 to 17 per cent from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The CEO, Graham Turner, said Flight Centre had made 8% of profits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, particularly for non-business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector bounced back in the second half, offsetting a slightly falling domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector has seen good results while business customers have spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to make a profit for the entire fiscal year for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown shoots at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unidentified burglars opened fire on a hotel near Cairo's pyramids in Egypt on Friday, resulting in an apparent dispute with fired employees.
The assailants fled, said the Interior Ministry spokesman, police general Abdel Latif.
The attack comes as Egypt no longer receives nearly any tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and repressed in blood the protests of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In the course of English literature, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diversified reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and Mathematics programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other core topics next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the CSEG structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a “wide consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,” insisting that CSEs would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth maths—as well as the greater importance attached to the subjects in the international rankings—would likely encourage more likely ones.
The program will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgement means that a bill passed in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An eight-year-old welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
The 9 and 13-year-olds were doing door to door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man explained to the police that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
Former Gestapo Chief Buried in Jewish Cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told the newspaper in large print, relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great mysteries of the post-war period.
The German secret services, the BND, also ensured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a command," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing a "general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were in particular its state of service with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council of Mitte district in Berlin stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous amount of bad taste.
“The memory of the victims is being rudely trampled,” he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had, among other things, under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks in the mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical care
Dr Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect “CNN Hero of the Year”.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to come to his aid.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would carry for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” Mr. Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation hasn't changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health expenditures are made in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 free surgical procedures over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas over the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, with about thirty people, they get stuck in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and traversing difficult terrain to get to the villages that need help most.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
Many times they had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overwhelming energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people each visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses, or a free birth certificate – a necessary document to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, town hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an exciting rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work she has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer at Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is always in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity to learn in the field that they do not have at home.
“We were able to participate in surgeries to help flush the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” explained Ms. O’Malley.
It’s not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you’re a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transport and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about that,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that drive me to do it.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, scholars have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but emphasizing its weak for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbitrator of works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise?
Sure, yet, but knowing that such a sacred one could not replace the real holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it happened.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but by noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image, the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil tongues were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a vivid eye-catching, yet incurably amateurish stubble.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who went without writing had a lot and well written.
The book that is here should definitely make it fair.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual vagabonding, the jubilation put to jump as if on foot from one subject to another.
But it is soon understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the broker back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the node constituting the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: This is an age-old concern.
Here we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at that time, French identity was a timeless essence.
All it had to do was deploy the accidents, and the case, obligatory Jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that follows Pierre Nora is different.
He does not inherit eternal frankness, he refuses to define it.
Analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he errs in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a crowbar, tormented by irritating questions.
Of this, which arises from the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masoned, do these dramatic calls to unity be heard?
They are so urgent, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure up the confusion born from the discords of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic, of course, is the one that divides national history into two.
After the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but could not deny it; concerned, on the contrary, to regain its sacredness, and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility, that it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora’s American escape could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American cousage only better emphasizes what is our own.
There, men who had left their former regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men overwhelmed with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she planted the drama and confided it.
There are always honoured founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are hardly modeled, and who have intertwined.
There is an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as so many errors to catch up and attempts to resume.
France is coming, France is coming.
There was a time, however, when the French believed they could sew the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
In this 3rd Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had a while.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the outline of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We find out that the chimney was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The sledgehammer stood in the center of the center.
And he who had laid down, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had refrained from the initial exercise of the thesis, confides us, cum grano salis, that he will end up doing it.
Certainly in a less rigid, more crisp and more subtle form.
But let’s not be fooled, just as compelling.
For much more than the imposition of the figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his Antenna 2 team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he took part in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Ghosts of the World", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hosts du monde".
On the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of the 20h of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because it is black - Roger Auque.
He says to me, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
This is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian military personnel.
We then arrive at the site of the Hotel Summerland where the press is present.
The French are taking us to the French Embassy.
This is the time of the first wires to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate ourselves to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on the French soil?
We'll land in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible bousculade.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three TV channels.
I'm back and there's plenty of it.
The descent from the flight staircase, the reunions with my son and my relatives, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and at home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull the beard to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent some from climbing.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're all of a sudden in the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to handle.
But we did the hardest.
The same evening, I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then start a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for a month or two that are a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I was entitled to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce the days following my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage-gatherers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what you're saying.
The debate on ransoms, among other things.
Some things irritate me, others less.
I'm trying to put things between questions about my past as a hostage and my president's hat of the "Hosts of the World" association that allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to approach.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem with semantics.
The hostage taking of hostages must be called "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why not say to the hostages, “You have violated the rules of war, as in all the Geneva conventions, we will bring you to justice”?
It seems to me to be well-founded, legitimate, and in common-sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main battle.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi trial
Anger is raging in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of fallen President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlines this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial, a pro-Morsi insurrection, he is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Conflicts broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an ID card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state robbery began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the Texan National Guard establishments, due to a conflict between Texan law and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to approximately 5,600 active people, including the National Guard, the Reserve and the pensioners.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will take place on Saturday 2 November at the skate park in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res.
Organized by the Bump Association’s SK8 Unity section, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will start in the aftermath, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young heroic prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing as long as it shows up to competitors who beat him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Who Came to Ask Him About a Drug Affair
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media outlets.
A video brought to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested party, Rob Ford, has always denied consuming crack, while acknowledging that he has a fondness for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove out of his property several journalists who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images don’t need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and support people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28," the health and agriculture ministry said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The departments are now calling on those who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or leached on a mucosa or on a skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 and 18 hours from 1 November.
“Since France has been free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free,” the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "aboriginal" case of recorded rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported dog from the Gambia was registered in 2008.
"Rain is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the departments recall, and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama steps back on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination from their service providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his promise of origin.
“The vast majority of people who have health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a whirlwind in the news” about the resignations, President Obama has urged Americans who receive these opinions to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better adapted health diets for the same price, or even for even cheaper than expected.
“You’re going to win,” he said.
The Administration has announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who self-insured were forced to change regimes because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better,” said Kathleen Sebelius in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market in October had failed “unfortunately.”
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, as she believed her microphone cute, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly meeting following an exchange of contentious views with Billy Long, the Republican advocacy representative of the Missouri.
For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to insist on asking Ms. Sebelius why the Affordable Care Act’s “architect” had not voluntarily waived the government-sponsored insurance to sign a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts for millions of dollars.
Vettel wears a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, has combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time world champion of Formula 1, took for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from its staff.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let's not be mistaken, above all.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la suburbue" is not only for suburban residents.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he explains.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes primarily the neighborhoods.
My proposal n<0xC2><0xB0>1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
He fought alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement in 2002, then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will listen to them as well.
There are only extremist parties I don’t talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - which can be consulted on the Internet - on many topics that are supposed to speak to suburban residents, including young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the post of guardian...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it may be fair, he admits".
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven top spots in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I’ve received since yesterday don’t all come out of the suburbs,” he said.
John Kerry admitted, without precedent, that U.S. espionage “had gone too far inappropriately”
John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.S. defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, without precedent, that on several occasions, espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government took note of certain things in automatic pilot mode because of course we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the war.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had exceeded the bounds, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said, “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to jump.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States, the chairman of the subcommittee of the Senate said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding a possible withdrawal from anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration aroused by monitoring the National Security Agency.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay with us in our mutual commitment to counterterrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has hampered relations with some U.S. allies, but the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding with the U.S. because it was about metadata collected by the U.S. and U.S. allies.
Other revelations have reported documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the Allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He indicated that the itinerary was still to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry plans to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the rancor generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, led by Shell’s poor performance and the day after an announcement by the Fed to maintain its support for the economy as expected.
Australian woman appeals for her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before admitting to inventing the story of all the coins.
She was held in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Department of Foreign Affairs to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after the payment of a 50,000 baht bail.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an aggravated sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to redraw its deteriorated image among tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest supporters of Anderlecht who came differently than with RSCA cars
French police have decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman of the police zone on Friday.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this Champions League meeting will have to use the displacement system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium," the spokesperson said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture said that measures have been taken to make arrests or even guards at sight," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The organization Vision Diversity has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of the tribe or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” explains A<0xC3><0xAF>da Kamar, president of Vision Diversity.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support of the staff in the transformations that we experience, within the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“Different pedagogical strategies, that’s the real need,” she summarizes.
The research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
