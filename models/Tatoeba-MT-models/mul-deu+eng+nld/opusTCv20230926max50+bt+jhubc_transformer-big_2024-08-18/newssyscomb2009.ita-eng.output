The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously waning, has suffered particularly strong losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the deputy prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, compared to the last elections in 2006, however, it lost 5.5%.
Even worse went for <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the people, which have provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage in their preference over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters obviously punished them for causing the government to sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe it could happen as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party’s leadership.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18% and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of the vote in advance - but the Social-Democrats at the same time revealed the concern of another EU party that was still separate from the BP party, when the populists agreed with the people in the 2005 coalition government.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter the parliament, but it fell slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally harvesting shrimp in India, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it doesn't work out, then it's going to cool down," he said after the meeting, which took place on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that executive power can hardly interfere with legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
Then you can ask for bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the appeal to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations we have had with India for many years.
Indians admit it too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really consider it a profound mistake to incarcerate and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he got the promise from the Indian side to take care of the matter.
"I've got relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
Approaching the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and Maritime Rights.
Its head, the Czech Division’s director lawyer, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, is following its exposure and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The Largest Base of the Land
The coastal states have begun to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the UN Convention, they exploit the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the convention, that has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental platform.
“In a few words, continental platform means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the committee with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have been successful,” adds Mikulka.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its marine holdings, has recorded a global echo.
But also New Zealand has gained us - the surface of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
Profit, which will bear fruit in the future from the seabed, as promised, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the “Montego Bay Convention” was ratified.
“Where the continental platform ends, the ocean bottom area begins, which the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.”
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
“But the seabed is not Klondike,” says director Mikulka, exaggerating, “with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It splits it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is crushed, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
“It is possible to extract on the total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a field rich in polymetallic aggregates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan explains.
A worker in the Macedonian division Rober Sandev brings with him a piece of art to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of imagination, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the revival of the Golem.
German special forces were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help for the release of the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is coming to us about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages captured.
German special units took part in the rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the army specialists were on site the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the ministry spokesperson said on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't make it by chance," a Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Aggressors kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on September 19: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers to the end has remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The liberated in the meantime arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not explain the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and special units are expected to fly with an Airbus of the military aviation and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell downstairs.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there had been no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been fought.
In a dramatic action, supporters tried desperately to persuade critics of the heavy package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the vote was underway, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The investor’s concern was that the state bailout could have failed.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turmoil in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, it must have the welfare of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has increased markedly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak views of conjuncture, the desire of Germans to travel according to an investigation remains solid.
On bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, the German tourism association DRV reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK market research institute, there are increased booking rates even for the autumn months.
Thus, the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV said.
Assuming these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar quotation, travel to the United States would be required in particular, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
It would also be particularly popular destinations for Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as localities within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive travel has a high quotation, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better computable for customers than for an individually organized holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with all-inclusive, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year there would once again be an excess of turnover - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann's hits, one-liter beer and vip in Dirndln grabs.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing we have in common: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photographers are already launching against us and taking photos until they fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
This is how you make friends
The two-money Dirndl seems to be reaching its goal.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress still remains within limits.
And once you get to the Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl’s crutch picks up strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun makes me note that I would have tied the ribbon in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
Suddenly, I set my bow from the back to the left.
All right," he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch his back naked against an uninvited one.
The boy with performance inclinations is called Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a scratched "oooooo".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrators, which everyone thinks is a diaper.
Bob is one of those famous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol this way.
At around 8 p.m., the sanitary workers, who have to take care of the poor beans, walk barefoot on the square of the party.
The nurses appear blank every time – always 4 at a time pull a barrel covered in a tent in a tent.
This works like most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Those who lie under the blanket in this blood alcohol-rate casket, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the nurses yells at me and disappears into the baron.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on the charge of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey Is Expanding Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, lies one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decadent.
But once inside the ticket office from the folding ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise than what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardant to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this railway that ran in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station, too.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded, destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disarray, largely surpassed by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all the points to the east, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new policy of commitment.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping carriage for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning — about ten and a half hours later — after a run-off along the tracks that produced the old-world cadence of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital — proposed as a new city for a secular state intent on turning its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-up media malls and power patisseries, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet first to make a contract.
Suat Kinikiloglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The goal of the foreign-policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case either.
They must be both.
"But certainly at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost all of those I have spoken with here have recited in memory: its links not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically traverse those railway lines to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised it would be to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And while I wait at the ferry terminal that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent to make claims about this fascinating country.
Vite remembered: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/ under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were over twenty – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutable) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to deal with everything the music presented to do, both madrigal and messiaen, without accompaniment or with the entire orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatorial or flourishing.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a conductor, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I’ve covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say I’ve never disagreed with just one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "ridden around the world one or two well-known battle horses".
There will be so many of us missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff’s necrology (September 25) specifies that “in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a Bachelor of Science, one in Letters and a PhD.”
This follows from the author's note of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is incorrect.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, at that time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the U.S. as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, it is not known.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have drawn my attention to the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino is able to capture magical moments."
Second Assault for Honda Supersales
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To everything should be added a refined mechanics, which increases the comfort of driving and allow you to save fuel.
Evolution versus Revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz features a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, before going over to analyzing the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after entering the first generation market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time frame than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, almost a million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, managers for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over the course of a year.
It is precisely the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda .di to reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company’s managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 less than in 2007, with a drop of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid – 4.37 meters long – that the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after its presentation in the company in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width of 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the total of 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, it also expands the living interior.
This advantage arises on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other hand from the introduction of the centrally positioned fuel tank, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the engine version 1.4, and that the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in models with 1.2 and 1.4 liter petrol engine.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to reduce fuel consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keep the engine torque high in all its stages.
The 1.2-litre model offers a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The drive – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces about 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horses, now 100 are available.
The 100 horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and especially by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking, for example, the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an expansion of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the compound eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at an angle above 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly uninterruptedly into its personal space.
To recreate this visual feature, the engineers developed what they called a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects obstacles facing the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately, allows to prevent collision.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics a bee’s movements and immediately changes direction by rotating the wheels at a right or higher angle to avoid a collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect up or down, and not even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and not taking advantage of infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act from this data.
It does not require information storage or intuitive manoeuvre logic, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, and not even mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than lithium-ion batteries.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to the destination avoiding the obstacles present in the route.
Trembling Before Applying for a Loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to possessing many capitals to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing to dubious insolvency bank rubbish loans, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: “Bad Credit Hotel.”
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"...or problems.
The tetro aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It’s more a teen page than a site for the general public.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, compare a dream room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a 21% stake in the Company, news came as a result of a net decline in its stock market shares.
A week after the drafting of an interim agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The fixed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a yield of 10%.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per share, a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
At 5 p.m., Morgan Stanley dropped 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition into a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow her to differentiate her shares but make them go under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the larger Wall Street names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The rules set on Monday also show that the deal has been changed in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for an amount of $8.5 billion.
“A week ago in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: “We thought our share of participation would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the global economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis."
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter were traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, refused to provide clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to set a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said she had "clearly" eased her budget from the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen the value of its shares halve, while the cost of risk insurance has gone uphill.
Cost that reflowed on Monday, but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” among Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, War Burenway’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism proper in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a vote basis of 80%.
According to these results, "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% white papers.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the electoral seats and an estimate by a non-governmental organization had announced a crushing "yes" victory, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft constitution in the night between Sunday and Monday.
The “Constitution triumphed gloriously,” he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians within the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which took place calmly according to the Organization of American States (OAS) election observation mission, was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction implemented by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives more power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-propose its candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free of charge of health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also bans the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive in the desert for ten days were reported on Monday afternoon, safe and sound, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo’s international airport, around 15 and 30 a.m., aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to issue any interviews to the press, to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy “good health” and no ransom has been paid to “the kidnappers,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been blown up by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari’s organizing agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, just before dawn.
“There have been shots, half of the kidnappers have been killed, while the others have fled,” said the official who requested anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the “lamp” unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commanders.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces from Belgrade.
We have to admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also refused to pay a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were on board and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers were linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), an assertion immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The Silent Majority of Culture
On the first page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign is focused.
All the better.
But part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will stand up to denounce the poor sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the sole restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon, in the Loire Valley?
To our American neighbors, it is the Constitution to state that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Québec, the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalisation the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in trouble for the first time in Europe because of the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
The first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' actions had begun with a vertical collapse, serious signs of the institution's crisis then appeared in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell almost 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current prices of the shares, the total capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s executives this value is not real.
The corporate summit blamed the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the $700 billion US plan.
On Monday, the title slowly resumed its rise.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come up with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid to lose their money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, and the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on data from people’s medical purchases, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken to the fox,” the Washington Post writes citing Richard Dick, the program’s author, to follow drug prescriptions.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of a claim to the health status of the potential customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not cover the insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure 10 years ago: based on the customer’s identification code, you can easily get information from pharmacies about which medicines he has bought in the last year and a half and from this the program shows what diseases he suffers and what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the level of fat in the blood is practically incurably high and is classified as the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer in addition to paperwork does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the downsides is that some drugs are usable for several purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or heat bubbles, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, is valid as a factor of increased risk, the first two do not.
For the request and data processing companies have been formed separately and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient’s approval.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even if they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some firms have also recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to drug consumption data in order to provide a more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to data and, at the same time, control of usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities control powers to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the forwarding data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise insurers do not conclude the contract.
So in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Martian Menu
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are primarily mutually traded partners, the agenda of the ninth summit has also been dominated by this theme, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will focus primarily on cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a major democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member states have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So you did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in his capacity as EU President, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in 5 years, i.e. to increase to 100 billion euros, the trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU’s partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb rising food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will travel to the French capital today where he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a commission worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
There will be over three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as an honorary guest.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be present institutionally with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The press meeting will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors on the total Italian production gradually decreases, and in particular on those for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane was discovered by a billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris was found on a 3000-metre-high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson escaped the doubts that remained: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,” he said in a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) said that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a team of investigators was sent, who then identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from a flight from Nerington.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal effects had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, of cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the scheme with an original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
It is this, in short, Glk was the last born among the offroad "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a whirlwind of innovation in this field.
Precisely for its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17 will be unexpected and unconventional as well.
Thus, the advertising batting that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-affections, articulated in three different stages, that will dominate the very central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, by looking at the image you will get the impression that the car runs away from the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to pique the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls of whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National for years and, so far, had never created excessive problems.
He never had a fight with his opponents.
The group's extraction is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags showing the militants' hometowns: Saturday evening they were taken away for unidentified purposes.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fan base of real Nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominal, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those games for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo running, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offenses, had been denied the ticket and prevented the transfer.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the documents that will come from the Bulgarian police then take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer put foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, to those little more than one hundred and fifty, more are added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way," the Viminale said.
So, "well-open eyes especially in view of Wednesday's National game in Lecce".
In Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, on Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choir and the arm stretched during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was first by Francesco Tagliente and then by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been questor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to snow the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I'm not a sociologist - adds the Observatory's <0x23>1 - the crimes must be attributed to the country where the crime takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened and we will value for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whispers at the anthem of Mameli: even those are not criminals, but if you will allow me, I am not education...”
