I haven't seen her in a long time.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.

Please, be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Leave your imagination to the will.
Okay, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove it?
You can't go into that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How long has it been since I last saw you?
If you do, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a soul mate.
Tom was silent for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered with your stupid business.

Mary came back from school crying because her girlfriends had sneezed her.
You have the right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work harder.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom revolved around the room, unable to calm down.
Would you mind if I had a hug?
I caught an empty cage.
Take a rest, Tom.

Why don't you come back sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.

Isn't that black?
This is not a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know that!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have a good time.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The confirmation of the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.

I'm the one who needs to do that.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit the torch before entering the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's a truth in what Tom is saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.

Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they were saying to each other.
This medicine will relieve your headaches.

Maybe she has other plans?
This is not a sentence.
Thank you all for coming! See you next time.

Thank you all for that.

Birds fly.
I'm still not ready.
I'm not angry at all.
As far as we know, it's Tom's fault.
I love you.
Tom's a book grinder.
I changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinking beings, only if they get that chance.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom pull out the thicker end?

We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom wasn't right about that.

Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Do you want to learn French at your school?
Come for a drink with me.
If I could understand, I'd tell you that.
You're running.
I took the first step.
Stop yelling.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the U.S. hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.

Could you have read it?
Will you dance with me?
We need to call Tom.

This usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked the bike.
And now a word from our sponsor.
I'm not happy with the condition.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
Just stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stand it.
Our eyes can't see the infrared rays.
It's time to sleep.
Tom's very smart.
Can I replace this?
Tom wanted to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring fen?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How are you feeling?
They all tell me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and ether are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can remember can help.
A lot of predictions don't come true.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.

You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Do you have a headache?
You have to learn English step by step.
It's better now than it used to be.
Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who was going to win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment for him. If he were to live a long life, he would be one of such desires, and a desire for eternal life.
Water is a liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.

Tom and I just wrote a couple of books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
The news has arrived.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful. Be careful.
Yogurt is made from milk and cream.
It's Sam.
Okay, how about you?
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That was just the beginning.
The book is sold out.
The price of gold changes every day.
Be nice.
Look back!
Tom got married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You are not allowed to enter this room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is the painting of trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back. Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a protagonist.
We can't go back.
I'm gonna suffocate.
What are you planning to do this year?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Could anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why are you asking?
I saw Mark's house.
At least you're being honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
And you, Brut?
The house where Ataturk was born was in Thessaloniki.
People are wrong.
It's snowing.
I thought you needed some help.
Does this make sense?
I like your sunglasses.

Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep on digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
Oh, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not leaving me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project, it's got a lot of flaws.
You texting Mary?
I'll keep your place first.
Mary urges her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
The little flowers bloom at night.
I was counting to 200.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try it.
I'll stay home with my grandma and grandpa for the weekend.
What did you finish?
I was praying for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of the living.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Tomorrow's Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's only a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're the average student.
As a child, many violent criminals were ruthlessly torturing animals.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long are you gonna be mad and yell at us?
Please, please, stop here.
How important is that really?
Would you like an aperitif?
Tom's constantly complaining.
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm getting used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he said to her.
I love the music that my friends have written.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.
Acts speak more than words.
Is this where Tom sits?
That's enough!
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's got a kick out of it.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
It's all my fault.
Don't answer.
Bring some wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
A few old houses need to be demolished.
What did you do?
I was trying to be aggressive.
Tom was hiding at the party.
I'm so tired I can't learn.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going to go?
This report isn't written very well.
I want a new bike.
She said that the government's latest move has multiple meanings.
They say that love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
The five brothers worked together on the farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high-quality products.
Don't forget to apply sunscreen.
Tom didn't try to deny Merri's fate.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend on Facebook.
Her hair covered almost all of her face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll owe you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who falsified his diploma to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I hadn't thought of that.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not just an essay problem, but all these nasty questions and explanations of the words make me terribly crazy!
He's here this weekend.
I'll be back next week.
Seems uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
It was a stroke of luck.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like this before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He began to scream.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your vocabulary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
Did Tom go crazy?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I was badly burned.
Back off, back off.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Take care here, Tom.
We've repaired some damage caused by spraying stones on your car.

I was just taking a bath.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, he didn't get seriously hurt.
In general, kids love candy.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just give it a try.
Tom's up.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take a day off.
How could I withstand it?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful thing.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm self-confident.
I can't believe it.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into this.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
That's my question.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out the thicker end.
Just follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He doesn't have a straight line.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious that Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. Back then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melodies of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom a lot.
Tom won't run.
I'd go.
We don't take myth.
Down! Down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you can remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
That's not something to worry about.
I understand they're a thorn in the eye of people like you, but this is just bullshit.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm gay, is that a crime?
Anyway, he's definitely coming.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Guys, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
What's your name?
I get it.
We're lucky, aren't we?
I'm crying.
I'm sorry.
Stop self-pitying.
It'll be over soon.
You learn by doing it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are after me.
Have you seen anyone there?
Anyway, you're not right.
He won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
No one said anything.
The book is on the table.
He's a real aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We know.
Tom goes to graphic design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always dissatisfied.
Music is his passion.
You're supposed to face reality.
Light waves pass through space and a variety of materials.
We were able to escape on time.
I'm sick of everything.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Cartagena must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could have a word with Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take a little.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm hungry for this run.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
Spike me naked.
Talk about others so they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we're gonna go through the jungle.
Reaction isn't always the best way to do it.
I'm not going to tell anyone that you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated with a proportionate share of the annual interest fee.
Tom bought the time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of superficial.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please, send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Yeah, well, it's over.
Tom's been ripped off.
Remember the name of the file before you try to return the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for us.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things go by my hand.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of the job.
He's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much will I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the test?
It's a book describing the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to stone yourself in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's out of breath.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone out.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I'm not going to watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer gave me a lot of support.
Those are beautiful shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We call Roberta "Bob."
It's hard, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They're teachers.

It happened right here.
He drove a car down the street.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I've been shaken by a lot of news.
The girl is eating bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not exactly like that.
They know you.
I've passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'm gonna kill you!
I was as cold as a sprayer.
There is no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with lots of new homes.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song just for you.
Your home, your freedom, your freedom.
Did you read the Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been learning all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a postal shipment?
What are you proposing?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have a home today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch it!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept a secret.

You're standing in blue.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.

I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
A card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
There was something on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives the god behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She yelled at him, but he didn’t hear it.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He will win the championship by his chance.
After silence, what expresses most accurately inexpressively is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still seems to be worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You have a hard day.
It's all right.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
The truth must be fully satisfied.
Tom and Mary would be a wonderful couple.
How to say XXX in Dutch?
Don't do too much!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was unbelievable.
People don't always act rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you take the exams?
We're taking the bus, we're gonna have to go on foot now.
I'll set you free.
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we make a group on Facebook so that we can discuss the learning of foreign languages?
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
- Did we agree?
It's not that scary.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Quit smoking.
Tom's gone there.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she laughed.
But why?
May I have a look at your card?
What's gonna happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They put up a library with new books.
It's clean.
How about a little chocolate cheese?
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a mistake in cheating.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
Coffee school cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It makes no sense to sneeze during a student's life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got bad hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that.
We're gonna miss you a lot if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's gonna happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's going to look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
The cost of living is growing.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I think Tom could do that.
I need five more minutes.
He sleeps like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.

Tom's a little worried.
Tom is the best student in the class.
How's this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.
Why don't you just tell Tom?
How did I foresee this?
This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.
What should I write here?
I'm deeply humiliated.
My father bought me a book.
I'm flexible.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?

I'm ready, buddy, let me see you!
Please, shut up as much as you can.
This fish is big.
Give me the sugar, please.

I hope we understand this.
We all have to face up to this.
Where's the toothpaste?
Mrs. Klein is in her eighties, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can't keep my eyes open.
Gardening is fun.
It's never too late to learn.
Give me the sugar, please.
Come on, quick!
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yelling.
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever posted a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in participating in the construction of a more intensive academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Tom gave me a few books.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Do you have any experience with Tom?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
"What did Tom see?"
How much is this umbrella?
I'm counting on her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you now.
Mary used walking sticks to help her climb and fall on the road.
You're fucking smoking me.

Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
On whose initiative is this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I love cable food.

When are we going to start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
This lasts for all eternity.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
The flowers are completely intact.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I don't like this book the least.

How did you do this?
Tom wasn't as handsome as Mary said it would be.

I'd take it.
Humans are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why have you kept quiet all the time?
It's skinny.
He saw Layla's reaction.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He ran away.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I've moved my right shoulder.
Get up!
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
I don't want to work under those conditions.
Mayuko avoided a hard job.
She has short hair.
Drive the pole.
My right arm was twisted.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do anything?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
All Henry's prices.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
One of the birds told me.
I couldn't see who it was about.
I feel safe with you.
Lud!
You're paying me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
The Chairperson opened the meeting.
It just wasn't our day.
It was raining.
Take it all.
I wish there was a God.
I've given up.
It's all wrong.
It's all screwed up.
Same-sex marriage is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland, as of yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try your way.
Use it.
You deserve to be congratulated.
I miss you so much.
Since the message was in French, it was easy to read.
This might hurt a little bit.
They can speak a little Spanish.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary out of it.
Could you add me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where have you been in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll learn more carefully.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us have seen Tom do that.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
Shame on her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His wife didn't provide any support.
I had dinner with him.
I wasn't interested in that.
Some of them were and still are in constant danger due to political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I don't think the internet is a place for kids.
That's been hard on me.
The teacher gave me the longest chapter.
What'd you finish?
You were created for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a typhoon.
Are we done?
Do I see it?
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom went to Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a little kid.
Take a look.
I'm tired a lot, but I'm fine.
Butter is made from milk.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things are going to happen.
You're wrong.
Several trees fell during a storm in our area.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
They were all smiling.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully to not miss a single word.
Do you have trouble understanding what women or young children are saying to you?
Looks like Cathy loves music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove it?
We're trying.
I'm quitting.
You let me down.
Tom looked so angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll have a job tomorrow.
No one cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I haven't been home all day.
I'd be grateful if you could stay until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, he's just not honest.
The bullet broke the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is doing very well.
He is no longer a member of this club.
Show me the pictures!
It helps us a lot.
I filled a glass.
I'm not selective.
How many uncles and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary went through the whole village.
The noise quickly spread.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
Heather believes me.
I just got here.
I played with Tony last night.
What Tom has done has helped a lot.
I know him well.
Without the tool, there is no craft.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Smoke slept with 25 men over the course of one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
That's why I'm very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.

Be careful with your wishes, maybe it'll come true.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who's gonna come with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?

How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.

Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?

She doesn't speak English.
I saw the sword.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope that Tom will be back safely.
I have no idea what's going on in his head, so he's going to reject such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean it up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.

Come here alone.

You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Do you know how to cook?
He loves sports.
I learned french.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One foot is in the grave.
Tom just told me the other way around.
More loud!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm compassionate.
Tom is dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
It's crazy like electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to your letter earlier.
Don't drink water from a dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I had ever slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here are her pictures.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.

He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to fix things on the go.
You're working too much, sit down and rest a little.
This one's really cool.
No one's saying a word.
I was just enjoying it.
You can trust that in some way.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
It helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I'm late for the session.

Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
It's not taught in school.
Is it clean?
I don't want to go out tonight.
"Will you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of here.
Fish can't live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Don't give up!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move! Move!
Please, wait a minute.
I don't want to do that!
I'm tired of fighting.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I looking for here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.

The unwarranted green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you smile at Tom?
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Can I have your vocabulary?
My fluent knowledge of the language is enough for many situations, but not to express my, often contradictory, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a shrewd guy.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.

I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I climbed once.
Show me the photos!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
Awesome!
I'm so pissed.
Can you pick us up?
Can you get there on time?
It's strange that the postman hasn't arrived yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How can we stop this from happening?
His novels are among the favorites of young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm going to buy a boat soon. What insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.

His misfortune has taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go back?
- Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girl on the internet.
She tried.

It was just a slice of cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom seemed to be very confused.
The results were unbelievable.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are clogged.
Have you recovered completely?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom was talking very loudly.
She drinks like a sucker.
Don't move!
An accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I let it go?
Are you happy?

What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxurious dishes, will be slightly more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's wrong with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
Meet me with Tom.

Tom came out of it.
Tom got involved with people he shouldn't have interfered with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
The termites eat the tree.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
You've betrayed me.
You don't have to judge a man by his appearance.
That's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They're going to give speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me too.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a fairly long history.

I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and spent a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
It smells delicious.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even excess.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was confident in himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom is feeling.
She's taking care of her old mother.
You're the most dependable person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French being taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna recover.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
You tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get engaged.
I'm used to not being liked by anyone.
The brakes are cracking.
Find Tom. Find him.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with a boy?
Tom still knows how to sing a song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
It's empty.
Did you see that Tom left?
Just be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well for doing this.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people are watching him.
I hope it's going to be a nice day tomorrow.
Maria nodded her head.
Let's sit.
Come and take a look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm retiring.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters Mary sent to him.
Go get some fun with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit quietly.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet?
Happy Resurrection!
Tom helped me save some dinar by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing you can do but admire your courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Get up!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom's gonna live.
Please read it in between the lines.
You've won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
I had lunch at the speed.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is a wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came in time.
Sweet dreams! Sweet dreams!
Somebody's got to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a stone.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
Wind is a clean and inexpensive source of energy.
As little as we know of its origin, at least we can be sure that it is a pilot of the Gospel.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I barely forgot my passport.
Why are you doing that, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with home-made machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
That's the toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope it's not.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
What a scoundrel!
What's tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When there are no cats, the mouse wheel is watered.
We need this from Tom.

It's Alina's book.
Are we going to see Tom again?

Have fun while you can.

I already told her.
I shouldn't have been in a hurry.
Check it out.
You're done washing the dishes.
I always thought it was weird.
The ring is tight.
All we know is that Tom is to blame.
She left her children.
Thank you very much.You should also feel free and ask for help in the future.
Excuse me, who is this woman?
Tom didn't act like a normal boy.
Several newspapers reported the story.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Tom shook his head.
Therefore, we have set up a small portable cabin that can be divided into two parts and can be taken anywhere.
It'll be all right in the end. If it's not all right, then it's not even the end.
Six divided by two is three.
I'd like you to sleep.
Let's meet!
Have you finished yet?
The lack of being ugly.
That can't be true.
Tom has a great memory.
Please don't say that.
We're going to the cinema.
Is it yours?
I already knew the truth.
I'm really happy about it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Just calm down.
I'm not too upset anymore.
The bad weather didn't let me go.
Tom hired a private detective to track Mary down.
The request was wonderful.
I don't like Tom's writing style.
Does she like my hat?
I'm sure Tom will miss me a lot.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.
My French isn't that good.
Can't you see that Tom's upset?
He's French.
I think we may have been too aggressive.
We'll never go back there.
No one knows what she's become.
Fish is good for you.
They know you.
I can't.
I've been asleep since 10 p.m.
I could have killed you, but I didn't.
Hey, hey.
What are you going to do this summer?
He put his thoughts on paper.
I'm a beginner.
I'm getting used to it.
Listening to music is my way of relaxing.
I wasn't involved in the conversation.
Tom got on the bus.
You were very quiet.
With freedom comes responsibility.
Catch him.
Let's go.
What's your favorite type of dryer?
Come and see me after work.
How did I miss this?

Tom just told me the opposite.
He has one son and two daughters.
Here's your bag.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're just wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There's a few reasons.
What are you going to do from now on? Do you have a target?
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
What's wrong with you?
I like grapes.
What are you gonna do?
I didn't care.
He came back from Canada.
“You talk too much,” he said.
I'm really happy about it.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
We missed Tom a lot.
I'm not ashamed of that.
They'll know what to do.
We didn't make it.
Wind is a clean and inexpensive source of energy.
I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
You can't blame everything on Tom.
I'm feeling good right now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I'm not sitting on it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?
He was a bare breast and a boss.
Everyone says I look like Dad.
Come early so we can talk about the plans.
Do you like dogs or cats?
Tom can't play the guitar.
He looks young for his age.
I don't know why my head hurts.

Who are you trying to fool?
Take care of yourself.
My husband and I share a room.
Layla immediately began to cry.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Looks like that diamond's real.
Learning all these sentences thoughtfully does not take into account.
What did you do now?
I'm sure you can do that.
You can't go into that room.
How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You've tried.
Tom decided to sell the car.
Who are you?
A new snow avalanche occurred on the way to E<0xC4><0x87>eskaret in Oda municipality in Hordalan on Tuesday evening and it is not known if anyone was trapped in the avalanche.
Are you a Uighur?
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car on my own.
You know.
Please, hurry up.
Tom climbed his head.
Do we have to tell someone?
He was flooded by the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom meant.
Don't be mad.
Loss of memory is more of a mental problem than a physical problem.
He exhaled.
He's starting to mess up.
The way it came, the way it went.
It's not as scary as it looks.
I'm in love with Tom.
Tom could be better.
She lives a happy life with her husband near the sea in Kamakura.
Tom nodded his head.
The spider took your car.
So what if it's true?
He was ahead of his time.
Don't get away.

That meant a lot to me.
The effect was very different from what we had planned.
Fish, please.
Aren't you ready yet?
I'll have to think about it,
Tom was talking about the music.
Everything has its price.
Yesterday was warm.
There were so many people in the car that I had to stand.
Are you a Uighur?
Curiosity killed the cat.
Why do people go to the movies?
I don't have a home today.
Tom and Mary get along well.
When will Tom be able to come home?
Did you do that on purpose?
I can see the reflection of my face in the window.
Go talk to Tom.
It's up to you.
There's no use trying to talk to him.
I was thinking about my family.
You could've spared me from coming here just by telling me I shouldn't even be here today.
This is going to make it a lot easier for us, psoao.
What's the weather like in New York?
I haven't been there too long.
Is it true that you're going to study in Boston?
Tell me where you live.

He worked ten hours a day.
This one's pretty cool.
This publishing company is a solvent company.
Choose one of them.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.
It's his, isn't it?
Tom is still going to be angry.
They can't recognize each other anymore.
I'm too old for something like this.
I don't fall for it.
He's a liar, isn't he?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.
She's very patient.
