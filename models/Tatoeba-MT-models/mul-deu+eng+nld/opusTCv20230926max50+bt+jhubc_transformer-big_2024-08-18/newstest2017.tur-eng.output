28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim’s brother, noting that he didn’t think there might be someone who might want to hurt him, said: “In the end, things were going well for him.”
The San Francisco Forensic Agency announced Wednesday morning that the body was identified as belonging to 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the cause of death was determined to be murder and that investigations were ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO, an ABC station in San Francisco, that Frank, who had previously worked as the head of the kitchen department in Boston, had started working as the head of the kitchen department in San Francisco Sons & Daughters, which he dreamed of six months ago.
Authorities at Sons & Daughters said the death had “turned them into joy and they were extremely sorry.”
"We're a small team here that works like a tight family, and he's going to miss it very much," he said.
In this difficult time, we would like to point out that Frank is not alone with his family and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially stayed in the hostels and said "in the end things were going well for him".
Louis Galicia told KGO, “He had an apartment and was dating a girl.”
Louis Galicia said he didn’t think he could be someone who might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a gentle man with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was to always prepare a plate for us, to cook for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He wouldn't like to get into a conversation.
My brother-in-law would fit every situation.
“When everything else in the world went crazy, it was this unprocessed diamond that shined brightly every day,” he said.
Those with information were asked to call the SFPD Newsline at the phone number 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: calls for new job retardation
Representatives of the assistant doctors asked their unions to allow the slowdown of work on a new contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Committee of Assistant Doctors (JDC) called on the general council to support further action to slow down work from the beginning of September.
The JDC said the ministers were unable to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students used a rejection vote in a contract agreement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a tweet on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government was “persistently silent” on the issues that led to the rejection of the contract.
He said: “In light of this, the JDC Board of Directors voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and called for a formal resumption of negotiations on concerns.”
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC administration has made an official request for the BMA Board to allow a program to increase the slowdown of work from the beginning of September.
The dispute caused assistant doctors to join six strikes this year, including a cut from the first in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malawana, assistant doctoral leader at the BMA, resigned after a vote was cast against the terms of the contract proposed by the BMA.
54,000 assistant doctors and medical students said it was a good deal for BMA members to accept during meetings prior to the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a manner that would be applicable to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: A 'Union of Inconsistencies'?
This was the one that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey came together on Tuesday to announce the official end of the eight-month war, which lasted with words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the showroom of the St. Petersburg Palace, I got the obvious impression that Ankara was the party that most wanted this compromise.
Hand clamped, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile was rather weak, and it could not be said that even against his own limited standards there was any heat.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an repeatedly referred to Mr Putin as a “good friend”; five times according to a report.
I was surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels, but would reach much higher levels.
The next day, it was stated in a newspaper here that Mr. Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the exact opposite of that.
But Mr. Putin’s cold intimacy around showed that the Russian leader hadn’t forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
At the time, the reaction of Russia was full of turmoil.
Mr. Putin, making a tough exit, accused Ankara of stabbed Moscow in the back.
The turmoil was much greater, the other side was thought to be friends.
Trust will be hard to rebuild in the real sense, perhaps impossible.
Since November, the views of the Russian people have changed.
The state-controlled media targeted Ankara in a shocking and aggressive manner for months.
All of a sudden, the Turks were the culprits.
The most serious of these were accusations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s family profited from illegal oil trade in areas under the control of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He has definitely denied it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to continue on the road.
In the end, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin had received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia can see this as a victory.
The benefits of the ceasefire call for Ankara are very clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after the unsuccessful coup that took place last month and will almost lead to his overthrow.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also affected him a lot.
Economic reasons are also effective.
The sanctions imposed by Russia have tightened, especially the ban on private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to the coastal regions of Turkey every year.
That number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies have also definitely relaxed with the fact that flights will continue.
They depend on the intensity of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a reduction in the prices of fruit and vegetables with the re-authorization of Turkish agricultural products.
To quote a report in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
However, the visit also had a distinct political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for not finding the response to the coup attempt sufficient.
When anger is added over the long-running progress of the talks on joining the US, Mr. Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey’s broken ties with the West and the cold in between, wants to take advantage of it.
The call for the support of the elected authorities after the Russian leader’s coup seems to have definitely gathered sympathy from Ankara.
It should be borne in mind that this attitude was also an inevitable one for Moscow, which had a deep fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this demonstrative seaside palace, represents an “alliance of inconsistencies” in the way an analyst of Russia and Turkey described to me: it unites the powers of the two countries that the West rejects and misbehaves.
Yet despite the image of this compromise displayed, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of these is Syria: although Moscow shows itself as an intermediary, Russia and Turkey support different sides.
After the first talks that lasted almost three hours, the two presidents said that the issue was not mentioned at a press conference.
While the President of Turkey clearly avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to draw the gold from them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine common ground in Syria.
But after months of clearly held matter – and given the absolute disaster potential that emerged from Turkey’s shooting down a Russian warplane by NATO member NATO – it is certainly a good development for the two leaders to start talking at least.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside of Scotland.
According to the bank’s executive chairman, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is associated with the bank’s global goals.
Eight years ago, it was almost impossible to withdraw from them and to give up on them.
During this time, brand strategy experts used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was backed by millions of pounds for many sponsorships from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Wimbledon Andy Murray Championship.
But now it has been decided that it will be right for more national brands to stand out.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new beginnings will be made.
All references to RBS in the UK and Wales, except for central and exchange listings, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already in use.
There are also smaller brands to take on a much more pressing task for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour in Inverness-shire for clients and staff.
The BBC told Scotland: “From now on, we will become a bank made up of more brands, and the RBS brand will no longer be the brand our investor brand and staff are employed by.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have global, but local targets.
Each of these brands will stand out in a slightly different way in the community they are in, and our staff will work with customers under the name of these brands.
RBS has announced that it will not continue sponsorship of the Six Nations Championships and is upgrading the profiles of different brands regarding sports sponsorship.
The chairman of the executive board said, “Now is the time to get to the concept of brand bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make this a better bank for customers?”
If three years ago we would be a great bank for our customers, and we would offer these brands, I would find this a snippet.
But I think you’re going to see a lot of change in the work we do and not ourselves, but in our focus on the needs of our customers.
We can put these brands back on the market, so I think it’s the right time.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000th time with his victory at Newmarket with Predilection
Dettori blasted champagne after reaching 3,000th victory with double success at Newmarket
Jokey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Friday.
On the local track, with John Gosden's trained Predilection, he reached this milestone by winning the second victory of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in an unhindered run.
He follows in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The jockey, who had previously won three championships in Ghayyar, said: "This is a special situation."
I'm so excited for my family to be here.
I’m really happy that this is happening at Newmarket where I started 30 years ago.
It’s not an important meeting, it’s not a Royal Ascot – it’s just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and relaxed.
Dettori accepted congratulations by bringing Predilection after the victory
There have been two jockeys who have reached this milestone: champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20 times champion and over 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career, retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy.
The nine-time Derby winner Lester Piggott has won 4,493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it’s not surprising that he’s reached the milestone that only a few people have reached before him.
Stylish and a strong person, but with a tactical mentality that has the element that makes him heavier on the scale than others.
He represents his horse race in an extraordinary way, attracting people to this sport with his excitement and charisma over the years.
A few weeks ago, at Epsom, I told Frankie that if it wasn't for a jockey who raced only on weekends and big races, he might have won the 6000th.
To be honest, Frankie has spent most of the 30 years she has competed in the UK with victories, which is great to see.
He has a pretty exciting character and this is a very good feature for English racing but beyond that he is an extraordinary jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone by jumping into symbolism with his jumping landing movement.
Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of the English freestyle for twenty years, with many moves from racing to jumping on horses to landings.
It was a road full of landing exits.
In 1996, he survived a plane crash, along with winning many major races including his famous 'Big Seven' victory at Ascot, and was banned for failing to comply with the drug ban.
Three years ago, he showed that he had a strong character in the way he needed to get the suspects out of his way and get the best out of it, even though he initially struggled to get back from this six-month expulsion process.
And it could go on for a while; Dettori had previously stated that he wanted to keep competing until he was at least 50.
Russian President Putin Takes Off His Special Pen Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly took over from his special pen Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was a part of Mr. Putin’s close circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Putin said that "Ivanov decided to end the task of the Russian administration" but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been representing Mr. Ivanov for this position since 2012, was appointed.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the Department of International Relations of the renowned Moscow State Institute (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later concerned with the protocol of the presidency and the administration of government personnel; the statements on the Kremlin website are as follows (in Russian).
After being commissioned, Mr. Putin said, “Thank you for trusting me.”
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of law enforcement and enforcement of instructions.
On Friday, Putin announced to the Russian television channel that he wanted Mr Ivanov to be removed from office and proposed Mr Vaino to replace him.
Is the smile convincing?
This is a move that surprises Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had long worked as one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and had served the KGB, like himself, by the Soviet security forces.
As a private pencil, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin and broadcast on state television, both stated that the private pen was withdrawn at their own will.
But despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, very few people here are convinced of this, especially at this time when parliamentary elections are approaching.
Is this a conflict caused by some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official statement that a person who could be president suddenly wanted to direct Russia’s environmental policy was met with big suspicions.
According to a quote on the Kremlin’s website, Mr. Ivanov said to Putin: “It is true that in our speech at the beginning of 2012, it is difficult – or even problematic – to ask you to trust me for the job for four years.
Well, apparently, for four years, eight months, I served as a special pencil of the presidency.
Mr. Ivanov took over this task in December 2011.
He had previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a former member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces such as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, while Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr. Ivanov advocated for him.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he described Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
Since Mr. Putin's presidency in the third term was also against the constitution, Mr. Ivanov was thought to be president after Mr. Putin's second term.
However, this task was transferred to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin was prime minister three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after shooting for producer
Gibson got involved in a physical fight on the set of the show last month in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which took over the production of the series, announced in a joint statement that she had been fired.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, issued an apology on Tuesday before the announcement of his resignation.
There were differences and disagreements about creative issues in the set.
In a statement, he said, “I am sorry that such an incident happened.”
The statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios states that detailed information about how the character played by Gibson will be removed from the program that follows a group of FBI agents will be given at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, previously featured in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
In a statement released Friday, Gibson said, “I love Criminal Minds and have worked to give him my heart and soul for the past twelve years.”
I would like to stay until the end, but this is no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our great team and, most importantly, the best supporters that a program can have.
The show is expected to return to the screens on September 28 for the twelfth season.
The Mystery of the Fish in the Banff Garden
A person living in the Banff area applied for help in identifying the fish that appeared in the Banff garden.
Kevin Bain thinks that these 75 fish may be sandfish carried by sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500 m from the sea, published his images on Periscope in hopes that someone would keep light on the emergence of fish at two inches in length.
Queensferry Pass: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers combined the north of Queensferry Gate with the lattice, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "relief fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 46 support cables with 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown was one of the first people to walk from the mainland to the bridge by visiting the facilities today.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Gate.
With this project, which is used to build just over 30,000 tons of concrete for this part of the bridge, we are all witnessing engineering on a real-world scale.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge covering the gap between the bridge and the bridge tray, this is a delicate study that requires extremely sensitive tolerances for this alignment.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge slab is located, meaning that the first concrete cut of the slab will be carried out in Rosyth today, which means that the entire slab will be ready to be lifted over the bridge.
Forth Gate and Bridge Contractors Project Director Michael Martin said: “In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents the leadership in the field of construction engineering.
After the last road table was placed and connected to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the north-or land-side.
This was achieved by pulling up to 700 millimetres to the south of the north viana.
This was a very large but also a very sensitive operation.
The reason for its size was that the violin was 222 meters long, weighing almost 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled in about 3% of the slope.
The reason for their sensitivity was that the team had to comply with very low tolerance values, up to just a few millimeters on both sides.
Luckily, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men "lucky to be alive" after falling off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station gave an alarm at 13:20 on Friday, after the order saw the Moelfre Bay incident.
The three men were trying to swim in a safe area while the boats were still on their way.
“We saw the boat drawing flats toward them and we were worried,” said Moelfre, the filican’s lifeguard.
He added: "Fortunately, we had gone away with strong winds until we were guided to them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat and the third man, 60, was found holding a shaman without a life jacket while he was tired.
They were all taken to the salvage filica that led to the coast, and brought to the salvage filica station.
Mr Jones said: “The three men who fell into the water are lucky that they are alive and have never been injured.
The boat engine had an emergency stop cable, but it must have been somehow disconnected from the person who was using the boat when the boat was working.
Someone was watching these three guys today.
A valuable type of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It’s amazing to see how the world changes.
The fact that teens and kids no longer go out to play games, prefer to spend their free time looking at screens has been a situation that most people have been saddened by over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get up from the couch and move.
Time spent looking at screens spread over time to video games and finally smartphones, while initially limited to television.
So it’s really great to see that technology and moving in the open air aren’t elements that exclude each other.
Of course, I’m talking about Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that was originally created for the video game in the 1990s (later turned into comics, game cards, and other by-products).
Like many phenomena of popular culture, this new game also contributed to its environment when it was introduced in the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
Subsequently, the presentation in other countries was postponed due to intense interest that caused overload on the servers.
Within days, Pokémon has reached more than Go Tinder and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
So how does it work?
To sum up, players are able to ‘picture’ or ‘capture’ Pokémon by taking their smartphones, using GPS in a tracked way, and ‘take a photo’ of what they have found.
He took part in this madness by stepping out of the couch for a generation playing the game at a younger age.
In the U.S., the "average" increased the number of steps a person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch and tracking 35,000 users, said that among those who followed the game within two days of its launch to the Washington Post, the proportion of people who exercised 30 days a day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to “spend 30 minutes of time,” “wake up from the couch,” and “be active every day” have been ignored because of the dullness of the public health message and its transmission by people who appear to be oblivious.
However, the importance of exercise is still underlined.
People who exercise on a regular basis are less likely to have cancer or depression.
Exercise, weight control, helps with issues like high blood pressure and diabetes, and has a list of benefits that are too long to be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, three basic elements of health are met: movement, clean air and fun with sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, there are also faceless players who are looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone can knock on the door while walking.
What does it matter?
A great innovation was introduced.
Although smartphone apps like Fitbit monitor our movement, they didn’t give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The impact of innovation will pass and use will decrease over time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, many games will be released that help people hunt more active, fit, and healthier by combining apps and virtual reality with real-world activities.

Simone Biles Receives Gold Medal in Women's Gymnastics Overall Assessment
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic about jumping.
Balance the money with the tools.
Surprisingly on the ground.
It's down to perfection.
And now he's an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast was the first to complete the overall assessment on Thursday, clearly showing the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
His total score of 62,198 points was well above silver medalist Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina, who is a friend of the "Last Five" team.
Simone Biles, from the United States, performed at the women’s artistic gymnastics overall evaluation final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil on Thursday.
Biles was the fourth and fifth American woman to receive the back-to-back overall rating award, and heralded the name of her own generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
When the final total was published, she drowned in her tears, and the long journey to reach this main ended.
This success has brought the sport to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in every generation that reach new levels:
Biles has won 15 World Championships gold medals over the past three years, including 10 years, and is one of the first to start this sport with a mix of ambitions and sensitivity, with which Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton has called himself "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
A final test in Brazil was waiting for him; this competition was much more between him than between Biles and other people in the field and the burden of great expectations.
It would have been a disappointment to return to his family home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals less than that.
Simone Biles from the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, after receiving gold and silver medals respectively in the overall evaluation of artistic gymnastics women at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, held in Brazil, Thursday, August.
Biles won the first national team coordinator, Martha Karolyi, on Tuesday as a celebrity sign at the farewell party.
Although Biles was insistent when he never looked forward in this long run to the summit, this is not exactly true.
The section, which also includes the patchwork transition that has become the symbol of the ground exercise routine, is prepared with Latin music that will fully adapt to the street just outside the Rio Olimpiyat Arena.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandfather and grandfather as a younger child and discovered by Boorman’s mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman was coaching, became a force.
He has not lost any of the overall ratings since the summer of 2013; this is a series of wins that Biles should continue as long as he wants.
Although Mustafina took the lead in two rotations, this was temporary.
The balance instrument and ground exercises that Biles took over the world championship had not yet been performed.
He advanced with 15,433 points on the balance instrument, and crowned it with 15,933 points on the ground exercise.
Raisman, while waiting for his final score, gently hugged him, and while Biles’ vision for a blackening notebook came true, tears appeared around the glowing red, white, and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was like a rematch of his performance four years ago, when he shared his fourth but later lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans named "mother" was ahead of them.
From time to time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after the place exercise he came across with a seemingly suspicious return.
For 19-year-old Biles, the much-shared tweet he posted earlier this week can now be said to have a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in ten years, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking in the car and listening to music, according to police reports released Thursday.
Officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a garage road on June 12.
According to the report, the gunman was standing on the passenger side of the car, firing eight guns with a gun and moving away with another vehicle.
Police say these three murders didn't appear to be robbery because the attacker didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Assistant Commissioner Jonathan Howard, a spokesman for the Phoenix police, said the investigators of the armed attack had directed them to investigate whether it was linked to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, a total of seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks in neighborhoods where Spanish people lived.
Howard told CBS's KPHO earlier this month, "This happened in the residential area in front of a house."
The suspect is thought to have used a brown Nissan in a model towards the end of the 1990s, a black BMW in a model towards the end of the 1990s, and a few vehicles including a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to explain the evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and that the same killer was responsible for the attack.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital due to her injuries and later lost her life.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died at the scene.
One witness told police that it was not unusual for these people to listen to music in a parked car.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting of an empty truck that was targeted half an hour before the three murders.
Investigators found bullet casings, pulled a bullet out of a seat, and also detected bullet particles in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "She's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his relatives, Edmund has a microcephaly disorder, a genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Picciuto was not aware of during pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't want that.
That’s not true, of course you want it.”
He and his wife Vincent were told that Edmund could never recognize them or even survive.
Some doctors have gone too far to suggest that it be placed in the nursing home.
Picciuto said: “My first reaction was to say that people don’t think they’re doing it anymore.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn’t sit upright or retire until he was three and still can’t talk.
But he is slowly reaching some of his turning points.
He can walk with help and ride a bicycle.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, “We teach him sign language.”
But as we know, it's not sign language, it's Edmund who invented his own signs.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may be present and may be caused by infections caused by viruses such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can show very large differences.
It’s much earlier to tell people who have Zika infection how their lives will be affected by this condition.
Picciuto recalls the emotional burden of the uncertainty of the future.
I was constantly asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know that.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease for a very long time than I've been expecting anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto is in a position to offer hopeful advice for mothers of babies who have an apology due to Zika.
She's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Louisiana has deployed heavy rainfall and water raids rescue teams in Mississippi.
Heavy rains and widespread waterfalls in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that flooding occurred in numerous rivers in northeastern Louisiana and south of Mississippi, and that this posed a threat of widespread water pressure following heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that support for neighborhoods affected by the situation was on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Govt’s Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Office, said demands were made for high-water vehicles, boats and cylinders.
Steele said tons of bribes were demanded only for Tangipahoa Neighborhood.
By Saturday, most of southern Louisiana will be subject to a watershed raid.
The weather service said it could rain as much as 3 to 5 inches in an additional area in a statement.
In southern Alabama, as the rain continued in the Mobile area, there was a waterfall on Saturday.
Both are expected to reach record levels during the week at the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs in Louisiana.
Estimate Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could leave many houses underwater in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding in the Ascension Quarter posed a threat to the flow of flooded rivers into Lake Maurepas as the flow of flooded rivers would be slow.
The Tickfaw River, located just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already reached its highest level measured at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescue crews continue to rescue people from water raids in the Amite and Wilkinson accidents south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law, were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from the Beaver Dermis, which was normally 400 feet away from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that another step-son who was sitting nearby was warning him.
Hansford said, “We woke up and the water was still coming.”
It was like mine.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level of degree he had seen in his 48 years of living here.
Hansford stated that he and his family members were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said all three of the emergency workers were rescued by a large military-style truck and taken to the fire station at Gloster, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continued, the flooding was "quickly spreading" and that authorities were considering removing the evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the floor has been at a high level since Wednesday, according to the report.
Authorities said the streets that were under heavy rains and water pressure had created a need to rescue residents of the Tangipahoa neighborhood and leave schools in five school districts.
CBS participating WWL reported that a female councillor in Tangipahoa said that 200 homes were under water pressure.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are now under pressure.
Neighborhood chief Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in the rising waters.
Shelters were opened for evacuations in the town of Amite and in the city of Hammond.
He said, "When the water starts to recede, they will be allowed to return home."
In the town of Hammond in the Tangipahoa District, almost two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters and cigarettes were offered to residents trying to keep the water away from their homes and businesses.
Lacy Landrum, the city’s administrative director, said: “The last major watershed we’ve been experiencing was in March.
Seems like a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said that the rain continued steady on the Gulf Coast.
He said several homes were reported to have been flooded on Tuesday, but that there had been no notifications so far for Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
Townson said, "I've seen water in places I've never seen before," and added, "and there's still rain."
"Body drilled with bullets" 6-year-old Mahaj Brown survived Philadelphia attack
Police said a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
Mahaj Brown was diagnosed by his grandmother and grandfather for CBS Philadelphia.
Brown’s grandmother and grandfather stated that he had multiple gunshot wounds in the body, skeletal area, leg, arm and abdomen, but was only conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station, “She suffered a lot, her small body was holed in with bullets.”
I can't believe that.
The boy was listed among those who maintained his critical condition at the hospital and underwent some surgeries.
The family told the station that she was expected to recover.
He was going to start first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was among the four people shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-olds were shot and two 32-year-olds were shot.
CBS Philadelphia said the condition of one of the 29-year-old men was critical and that the other two victims were stable.
The station said the boy was shot in the front seat of a car along with one of the 29-year-old men who was critical of his condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured was aggressor.
Detectives have stated that CBS Philadelphia may have been shot by more than one armed assailant.
The scene was filled with bullet casings in the style of assault weapons belonging to different assault weapons.
Looks like it's definitely been a long-term conflict.
There were buckets on the street and on both sides of the lift.
This shows that there are more than one armed assailant and that both are active,” Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have taken place, and police have been investigating security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was shot in the arm with an accidental bullet while playing in front of her house in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
I’ve named this year’s Olympic Women’s Gymnastics Team and there are several reasons for this.
First of all, I’ve been at all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so oppressive before.
Secondly, this team has three gymnasts who inspire many girls of different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally showing a similar look to America.
It also reinforces the presence of black and Latino women at the top levels of this sport.
In the last four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in 1st and 2nd place.
It's a powerful thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America supported him.
Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who are now the world’s three World Championships, will be able to witness their extraordinary performances, consisting of the gymnastic routines they masterfully exhibit.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win a gold medal in the women’s overall rating.
And teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We are familiar with the best times of this sport, but this is not the case in gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to take part in the Olympic teams.
The reason they are the "Last Five" is that there will only be four gymnasts in the next Olympic gymnastics team and this will be the last year that Marta Karolli will coach.
But in reality gymnastics is a fairly expensive sport and gymnasts work primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which are paid by parents for education, travel, form, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and families) and many more.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in the wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can subsidize these businesses.
These clubs are the only place gymnasts can be trained and require an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
For the countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we don’t offer communities more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I set up my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, Harlem-based, we provided free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 gentes in the city (particularly black and Hispanic) and coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (where I grew up) to provide high-quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve to learn this wonderful Olympic sport and take advantage of it.
Gymnastics improves the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and provides the characteristics of mentally rigorous work, discipline and determination.
This combination offers long-term benefits in terms of health, school and work success.
It’s going to inspire thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that’s a great thing.
Participation in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We're going through really exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison, as the Olympic team, are grateful that they have clearly shown "The Power of Girls" and motivate many young girls with different backgrounds to be a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s offer, the assistant doctors decided to continue the strikes.
Ministers hoped the dispute would end after the agreement was reached with officials from the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who participated in the vote voted against it.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced his plans to enforce the contract, stating that the NHS was "no one's property" and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first-aid group of physicians was moved to a new contract that included changes to work practices at night and on weekends to improve care outside of normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the U.N. Assistant Committee of Physicians, said in a statement last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially if they think it will trigger the current workforce crisis."
For the first group of doctors to be transferred to a new contract, only eight weeks remain to make progress in this process, and the time is about to expire.
The efforts to resolve the UN’s disagreement were met with the government’s unwillingness to interact and in some cases with deafening silence.
This is an improvement seen despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise that last month’s door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt should immediately take action, lift my sentence and listen to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
The assistant doctors clearly state that they are prepared to increase their work delay actions if they do not do so.
In the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, nurses and consultants had to replace doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the agreement was reached with officials of the British Tabiplers' Union, which was developed.
The BMA wants to improve weekend salaries for 54,000 contracted assistant doctors.
Daniel Mortimer, director of the NHS Employers Executive Board, called on assistant doctors to refrain from any strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said: “The strike does not solve anything, but putting pressure on the team and services that are already intense causes anxiety, discomfort and distress for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have continued our discussions with the Committee of Assistant Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other authorities, have approached positively concerns about the Mission of Surveillance and Findings in Information.
Employers, important issues - distribution, flexibility of education, additional education for those who intervene in their careers, training costs, mutual agreement on the curriculum, permission to study, and salary difference between the sexes in medicine, such as the provision of income and the provision of income, and the maintenance of positive communication in relation to employment.
Drugs that can eliminate the risk of heart attack at a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day
After authorities recommend that more people be given over a longer period of time, thousands of heart attack patients will be able to benefit from <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day.
Ticagrelor, which prevents clotting, reduces the risk of repeated seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months following a heart attack and was reducing the risk of stroke or another seizure.
The NHS observer, NICE, suggested that this should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, has suggested that this should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people in the UK have a heart attack each year, and one-quarter of them have another crisis or stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the accumulation of oils in the artery walls.
If the plaque breaks down, it can cause a blood clot and block the blood going to the heart.
And if the clot gets out of place, it's in the bloodstream, and it's blocking the brain's blood flow.
People who have had a crisis before are at higher risk of having another crisis.
Ticagrelor, created by the UK company AstraZeneca under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of clotting.
The draft NICE guideline, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention therapies, a quarter of those who have a heart attack are suffering from another heart attack or stroke, and their results are usually the result.”
Fear of regeneration can have a rather negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack and stroke in people who have previously had a heart attack.
With Ticagrelor being temporarily recommended, we are pleased to have increased treatment options for the thousands of people who are waiting to take advantage of it.
Since there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor for more than three years, including the initial risk of bleeding, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC Culture Increases Voting Corruption in Muslim Regions
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman has been removed from office following a government report last year due to corruption
As the disastrous government report presented today shows, the culture of political correctness has led to widespread voting corruption in Muslim communities being ignored.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles has condemned the police, election observers and the municipal court for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud due to "excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former community secretary and today’s anti-corruption tsar said the polling of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police needed to be allowed to pull strips out of polling booths to protect the fearsome voters.
He suggested that voters keep their identities with them in order to prove their identity when they voted.
In the current case, it is enough to tell the name and address of the selector.
The report even suggests that permanent ink should be applied to the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said those in the report need to be better protected.
He called for better access to the press on board papers and decisions of non-formal committees or working groups.
“This is not only about protecting against fraud in the elections, but also about protecting the local government from a culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was prepared by Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided on Lutfur Rahman, the mayor, to be removed from office after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "inexorably undermined" the religious sentiments of Muslim society and silenced those who criticized him with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
It was stated that Rahman carried out his "campaign on the basis that it was a religious duty for believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 games were suspicious or resulting from the use of fake IDs, i.e. voting as if they were someone else.
Sir Eric has stated that there is evidence that fraud has been committed throughout the country.
He warned about corruption in voting by mail in particular – where the Muslim community was alleged to be putting pressure on the elderly to vote on the island of their choice.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions for organizing the voting system in a way that includes identifying people to prove who they are.
The report included the following statements: "Pressure that some ethnic minority communities are primarily being pressured to vote on their valuable individuals, including women and young people, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, in line with the will of the elderly.
"There have been concerns that state institutions have ignored such behaviors because of their ethnic origin and "political correctness" based on extreme sensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals for the system to be regulated in a way that also prevents political activists from processing their ballot papers by mail for the purpose of "collection."
The report, which was reviewed by Theresa May, also called for tightening registration controls to prevent the constituency from being used for immigration and social assistance corruption purposes.
Consideration of the option of conditional identification of voters prior to voting.
Permanent application of ink to the fingers of the person after voting to prevent any person from voting twice.
Conducting systematic checks on a person’s compliance to determine the eligibility for voting.
Application of a three-year limitation on requests for the use of automatic mail.
Prohibition of political campaign officials and activists to process ballots sent by completed mail and ballots sent by post.
The police are given the authority to strip around the polling booths.
Amendment of the law under the People's Repräsentation Act 1983 to facilitate the charge of intimidation of people.
Making it illegal to take photographs in voting booths.
In the voting booths (except Galeria) only condition of speaking English.
Strengthening the training that the staff receives from the law on the entry of voters into the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric vehemently criticized the Police Department by saying that it was "interesting" not to make any accusations in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has ruled that there is no place to blame for repeated corruption and illegal activities for Lutfur Rahman and his representative," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable suspicions, according to the nature of the evidence.
He also criticised the city hall’s ineffective “box marking checks” in the electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s ruling by Tower Hamlets was a warning.
While our nation has the pride of forming the mother of parliaments, this worrying and covert election corruption and the rejection by some institutions can cause this reputation to deteriorate.
Be crazy about Kate's biker resemblance and other famous resemblances to Rio Olympic Players
This week, Rio 2016 Olympic enthusiasts have gone crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proves she looks impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete isn’t the only athlete to draw attention to celebrities as he struggles for the gold medal this summer; at least that’s what social media thinks.
For this reason, in honor of all the famous Sims we see on our Rio Games and screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes that look beyond reminding Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, member of the U.S. Men's Arrow Team (left), compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate’s bike lane, many people in the online environment have shown that an archer can resemble as much as a twin Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Arrow Team, tweeted after he showed photos showing his resemblance to the star of Money Hunter.
And the archer admitted that he's been told to look like Leo since he was a kid, noticing this social media madness.
Brady told the Huffington Post, “I don’t think there’s a lot of similarity except for hair and hair.”
"He's a handsome man, so I think it's a compliment."
One of London’s most popular comparisons of 2012 is one more similarity that will undoubtedly attract even more attention this year: the incredible resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
It was stated that Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was a close relative of the Cuban-born American artist Gloria Estefan with her large and meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been likened to Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user states that Nathan’s Starter movie star is an ‘athletic version’
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other due to the similarity of their eyebrows and lips.
While the Russian team’s silver medal swimmer, actress Annalynne McCord, has the same bronze skin and yellow hair, fans say Nathan Adrian of the U.S. Team is reminiscent of the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes
Not alone: A Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed this similarity as well
A theory in the air: This user thinks that there might be a reason behind this couple's similar appearance
A Twitter user was happy to hear that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are twins too.”
In fact, the American football star and the actress who plays Dexter have similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost the same smile as each other's other gold medalist Gabby Douglas and the star of the film Fire of Youth, Gabrielle Union's big smiles.
CBC Olympic Spokesman Apologizes for Chinese Swimmer's 'Death Like a Pig' Comment
Byron MacDonald's analysis of Ai Yanhan's fourth in a 4x200 m freestyle race was outraged by CBC's Wednesday live Olympic broadcasters.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologise for comments by one of its spokespersons that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer has been “swallowed and wiped out like a bad odor” and died in the race.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when the women began to express their ideas in the 4x200 m free-flag race final.
It was reported that MacDonald, who was included in CBC’s speaker team to add ‘color’, used the words: ‘A 14-year-old little Chinese bagged a heavy bag, baby.’
He was over-excited, wiped out like a bad odor, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the flag race with a time of 1:57.79, allowing Canadian Taylor Rack to close the gap between China and Canada by remaining 1.61 seconds behind.
Canadian viewers were shocked by the tone and language they used, and quickly took action.
Emmett Macfarlane: “The CBC spokesperson just said that a 14-year-old swimmer ‘died like a pig’.
He wasn’t aware he was still on the radio.”
In the 4 x 200 m Free Flag Race, the Chinese Ai Yanhan was defined as: 'A 14-year-old little Chinese bagged a heavy bag, baby.'
Criticisms about Byron MacDonald were posted on Twitter quite harshly and quickly, and many of them reported him.
Twitter users couldn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Vay <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all look like racist.
Shortly thereafter, CBC broadcaster Scott Russell apologised for MacDonald's remarks, saying, "We apologize for the remarks made about the swimming race."
These were really unfortunately chosen words, and we’re sorry that such an incident happened.”
CBC has apologised at least 90 times more than tweeters in response to the comment.
Scott Russell, another speaker, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC later copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who reported complaints about MacDonald's comments.
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been published.
Last night, in the broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and to our followers on social media.
We'd like to explain that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were rather inappropriately and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron was extremely saddened by what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald also apologised in a broadcast, saying he did not want to be involved in a personal attack.
He said: "I would like to apologise for the comments I made after the women's flag race last night.
“I was referring not to the swimmer’s personality, but to his performance.”
“I don’t have to say much, I didn’t want to disrespect you, and I’m so sorry.”
Primark's customer is angry at a woman who desperately tries underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman took off her underwear to try out at the store in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, the woman looked at what it looked like in itself, took it out and put it on the shelf again.
He went on to look and then tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The place where the woman tried panties before putting them back on the shelf was the Primark store located in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The two children's mother, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman "was dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
He said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.”
He stopped in the middle of the store and took a pant from the window, put on his panty socks and pants.
“He didn’t try to find a special place to do this, he was in the middle of all his disrespect.”
"Everybody was looking at her while she was pulling out, and it seemed like she didn't like the panties because she put it on the shelf again."
She tried three more laundry until she decided she didn't like anything, and then went out of the store again, dressed again.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching him, and he didn't think of the person to buy the pants he tried later."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in the city, said: “How disgusting it is to think that someone else is wearing an uncleaned underpants and will go home.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “I think the person took out the clothes after he left, which is a good thing.”
“When I get a new panty and go home, it would be really bad to think someone else was wearing the panty and coming to me without washing it.”
A Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of what happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
The relevant product has been removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from armed attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is quite dangerous but this video provided by Dailymail.com can help you be safer.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, head of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with nearby armed robberies.
Whether it’s approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
When Mizrachi approaches you from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn your face and see the assailant and ‘leave the line of fire’.
Then you will hit your face with your elbow in the hollow by holding the gun between your forearm and your shoulder.
Then when you kneel down on their cheeks, the pain of the assailant will double, and at this stage you will take the gun from your hand and hit him in the face with the back of the gun, so that he will stay up.
When the gunman approaches the front, a similar technique is applied; pulling your body out of the line of fire, you take the weapon and turn it in a way that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, giving your weight to the weapon, punching the assailant from the chest area, turning the gun, taking it from him, and pointing the gun back at him.
Does it sound sluggish?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you’re not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery will be to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright Drives His Language to Europe's Worst Places for Travel Guide
The British traveler has passed a serious test of his immune system and reflexes, lying to some of Europe's most ugly and disgusting places.
The server and travel writer, Suffolk Ian Wright, 51, drove his tongue on a Euro banknote, a Piccadily Circus cradle, a chiffon button in a train toilet, and a polling telephone in Russia to prove the strength of the immune system.
He used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of work he was doing before he licked each object.
But the experiment, which was to be converted into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, gave some surprising results.
While the idea of licking the chiffon button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there is actually a lot more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical experts about the growth and health of stomach bacteria throughout his trip in Europe.
Luckily, nothing he licked made an impact except the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright is well known for his testing the endurance of his stomach by wandering the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, across a wide range from general scavengers at train stations to toilet siphon buttons, absolutely tested the immune system.
In the film, he said: “I haven’t been very careful about my health since I was a child, and I’ve put a lot of things in my mouth, from the soil to the desert and the muddy water.”
During the course of the film, he proved the reason for his fame.
The only thing he refuses is a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The specimen showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
If a comparison is to be made; in newly washed hands this number must be below 60.
But in the newly washed hands, under 60, there was a Russian public toilet where the luminometer count declined to lick when it reached over 4,000 units.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have taken over the production of the travel film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, he said, “It’s about to be one of the worst things I’ve ever smelled in a toilet.”
There's nothing worse than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was developed together with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with lactic acid bacteria as well as Valio Gefilus, which contains vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the stomach bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of the Department of Snacks, Juices and New Categories at Valio said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Watching is something that is impressive and at the same time will explain the benefits of probiotics.
We finally did a lot of crazy brainstorms that came up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They claim that their interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a much bigger bind; the good and bad bacteria in our environment on a daily basis, the importance of stomach health and its connection with the immune system.
Interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we would be able to provide consumers with more interesting information about this condition.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Director Tom Hakala added, “I’ll say this: If Ian had lied about some of the things I wanted him to do in the film, like the disgusting Russian toilet, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Of course, it was easy for Ian to lick some things, but some of them were pretty hard.
I’m glad we recorded some of these dirty licking actions.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of participants associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least periodically.
The Maganda family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall's social housing estate before evacuation
A Maganda family left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 worth of damage to the social premises where they were evacuated because they feared their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, were fired from Saltash, Cornwall after many complaints about her rights.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the housing association officials were surprised to see that the property was irreparable.
There were large holes in the walls, the floorboards were torn down, the rubbish was rubbish on the floor, and the walls were painted with inscriptions.
The family has now been removed from the apartment and is believed to have taken advantage of private accommodation options
Cornwall Housing Director Donna McEvoy said she was afraid the situation would be unrecoverable.
He said: ‘This is a real nightmare for the people here and I think people don’t have to live like this.
There's a lot to take into account because this property will no longer be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived on interim property, and according to police, the family has adopted many frightening behaviors, including fighting with a baseball bat on the street, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, controversy, and disbelief.
In June, an anti-social behavior decision was made for Skeldon (47), who was named in the Kira contract.
Old rubbish was found in many rooms of the house that was thought to be destroyed
In the past, the property's flooring boards were removed.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and that the police were often called.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evacuated her and her husband from the property this week after 11 weeks of recognition, extended for their voluntary moves.
The evacuation process was greeted with joy by relaxed neighbors who said their lives were turning into nightmares.
One person said, ‘No one cared.’
We've been living alongside them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You can't believe how many times we've seen the police here.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We wake up because the environment is so quiet; we’re not used to it!
They're finally gone, and now everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighbor of Cornwall Housing, said the family did not cooperate with the local administration.
The family lived in this house for 20 years, and the property was often called police.
Waste and old toys were thrown on the side of social housing covered with plants
He added: “It’s really embarrassing that the writer has not taken any responsibility for the evacuation of himself and his family; the evacuation has always been the last option Cornwall Housing applied for.
This was a very difficult case, since the behaviors were extreme and the actions were frightening at a level that neighbors should not witness.
“I greatly appreciate the efforts of my team, Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, and the community members who are brave enough to give us information.
I hope it will be understood as a message that this development will provide some relief to the neighbors and that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons who lived on the property at different times but they were in their 20s.

In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of mushrooms, groceries, private items and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after admitting to having been charged with possession of Class B drugs for intent to sell.
He claimed he would use the money to buy a gravestone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.

Police say they will work to evacuate tenant who violated rental rules
Angela Crow, from Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, said the evacuation was also a warning for other tenants who continued to violate the rules of evacuation.
"This is also a message for those who think that they can act as they wish without encountering any impulses and that their behavior will be futile," he said.
Devon and the Cornwall Police Force, who will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
As a low-flying military plane crossed the coast, tourists in Portugal were horrified.
Portugal, sunbathing tourists in Aveiro, lived the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force flew the P-3C Orion aircraft from extremely low altitude
The air force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when tourists start to panic as they fly over a jet-filled beach.
Dramatic footage shows military planes approaching near the level of contact with those sunk on the sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers rose to their feet because they were understandably concerned about the noise caused by the jet engines, regardless of what was happening to them from the clouds.
The incident took place on the Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who shared the video of the dramatic near-flight on social media, said: “Twice it really went down and it seemed like it was about to hit at one point.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me.
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane that came out of the darkness began to fly at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft is on a training flight to identify the fishing boats on the coast and that the only way to control them is to go so low.
The near power extinguisher said the jet flew lower than normal due to low visibility due to smoke from the nearby fire, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was compromised.
This summer, extinguishing power fires pretty much destroyed certain parts of the mainland of Portugal and led to the deaths of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot had to fly low-lying due to conditions that made it difficult to see (power delivery due to intense fog and smoke from fires).
The aircraft was on training flight and was asked to identify the pilot's fishing boats as part of the exercise.
London student who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria.
Last year, it was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British girls who left London to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said his family received information about Rakka's death in Syria a few weeks ago.
According to ITV News on Thursday, the group is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike on the Rakka region, where the group is strong in the country.
The sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died while planning to flee the war-damaged country and return to Britain.
Akunjee: “We hope that this situation will emphasize that going to war zones as a gravestone and testament to others is really risky and will break people’s courage to make this choice.”
In February 2015, two students from Sultana and East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that he married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid said he would not give up Garland as a High Court candidate if Clinton was elected
In the Senate, the Democratic leader Harry Reid said he believed the Democrats would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court when Hillary Clinton was elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have been hampering Garland’s approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will elect a new president to replace former Supreme Court Judge Anton Scalia.
In a video speech on Thursday, Reid said that Clinton believed he would choose Garland and that "there is a reason for this."
A spokesperson speaking on Reid’s behalf later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland and was in the spotlight.
He praised Garland himself and said Clinton’s team did not want to “disrupt the current situation” by making a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Court of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans who prevented Garland from running for president said Republican nominee Donald Trump was the “haters” and “leftists.”
He said Trump was not fit for the job.
Treats says he’s in favor of a ‘naked calendar for women as well as for men’
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of celebrities and nudes, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for the 2017 NU Inspiration Fairies calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw said earlier this year that this magazine, which has a high nudity rate, was different from the old Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Obviously, she believes my calendar is like that.
Shaw said in a press release on my calendar: “Like men, we need to go back to the classic nudity show, which is not fashionable, so that women can comfortably look at these images of the female body.”
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or participate in public interviews in Los Angeles and New York.
The vinyl goal: who are the buyers of plaques?
Middle-aged, lonely men love vinyl.
AllOnlyMiddle-Age MenNo, let us tell you that this statement is based on real data before we go to the comment section to find great insults under our belt.
According to YouGov, the return of plaques, which is a much talked about topic, is not a result of the Y generation in pursuit of innovation created by a physical object, but a result of middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently purchased vinyl albums are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely.
This is also not only due to the act of accumulating curiosity; it is emotionally important; older vinyl buyers are often people who like to keep their feelings to themselves (56% and 53%) and who enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
Are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were news on television, the camera would watch it on a crowded street in Soho, walking in a modest gray outfit, exhibiting a lot of gestures before stopping, and putting my hands together and saying something authoritative like, "Then let's take a look."
Well, let's take a look.
While Soho's center is slowly losing its magnificence and unusual air (which was once home to independent sellers now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases) there are still a few specialist record stores available.
I’d probably like him to stop by the camera for the next part; I’d try to find out about his age and emotional state by standing near the different men in some of these stores.
From Sister Ray (Data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Data count: eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s) I'm going to see Glasgow Stuart (55), who fills up an afternoon for a meeting, and spends an afternoon in London.
I'm asking if it's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plaques.
These plaques above the picture (he sent me the picture by e-mail, I didn’t follow him to his house) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason for so many albums and singles being collected is partly a result of their expendable income; they are now able to get plates where their money is not enough when they first come out, and they are able to buy back what they sold in their youthful and immeasurable times.
"Most of the things I get in the late '60s are in the late '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old; I'm too young to get," he says.
Plak agrees with the idea that buyers who like to stay alone are highly likely to be introverted people, adding: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad feeling.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that most of the customers she meets fit her YouGov profile.
But he also realized that there was a new wave of over-advertising in the media, and that people who heard this fashion come back need to buy back old plates.
In my interviews, I realized that people usually took away their collections in 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who sell their vinyl to buy CDs first now sell their CDs to get the records back.”
This may explain the increase in people of a certain age who revitalize vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional importance of plaques?
It takes a few seconds to notice that in a store like Phonica, plaque stores offer a comfortable community of people with a similar personality.
According to Wez, some of the older major customers have relied on the contactless payment system in particular.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to take refuge in the stability of familiar plaque covers, reminiscent of the buzzing and reminiscent of youthful memories of the digital world.
Wez says, "Sometimes this can be caused by filling a gap or seeing material things as a kind of comfort."
Since I am a collector myself, I have this and I think it is in most people.
This is an easy way to fill your head.
A colleague who jumps out of a pile of plaque says, "We're like social workers."
A survey conducted in April revealed that last month 50% of vinyl albums hadn’t listened to the album yet.
The survey also found that 41% had a pickup that they never used, and 7 percent had bought vinyl while no plate drums.
At this stage of the news, I would probably exhibit a very worrying look while studying a number of bossa nova compositions.
The "reversal" aspect of this comeback is also a feature noticed by Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of Universe (Data count: three middle-aged men).
“Someone came to me recently and said, ‘I don’t have any plates but I want to get a Radiohead plate to put on our shelf.’
This does not represent a large percentage, but it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have plates."
These are not the elderly, but the young, who are in their late teens, who are new to this subject.
Now when I arrive at Fopp, who has separated almost all of the solids for vinyl, I see that the mass is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photographs, young boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere spreads sex-containing pop instead of the less cool and soothing jazz from the shops mentioned above (the last part of the Wild Beast), it’s good to see the diversity among customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to solve the psychological traumas that bother them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been browsing Fopp for a few minutes and looking at the plaques at the discount.
Instead of spending, he just went out to look at the showcases.
He says he doesn't have the option to make a plate collection because he doesn't earn much.
It's very expensive.
It is easier to listen to music from the computer or in any other way, but the beauty of vinyl..." he moves away, pulling away like a lover.
I don't know how to explain it, it doesn't really look like it.
My last stop was a store that was said to inspire the new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
As she looks at the coat pants, I observe a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before her father and daughter’s discussion of buying a Crosley plate lighter.
On the left, Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac have a staircase filled with plates; if not for an average collection, there would be plates; a mix of modern and classic.
No one is looking; maybe these are just for decoration purposes, some are too high to touch.
It's completely "synthetic vinyl."
But the curiosity about these items may mean the industry is making more money and sending less customer to Soho’s depths; there’s not much to complain about.
It’s not surprising that a demographic group that has more money and time is spending more money on more luxury items like vinyl.
But my findings show that YouGov’s results are true at least in Soho’s record stores; they don’t take into account female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts, who are too many, in reality, in record stores or online forums.
These people are probably working pretty hard at school or in offices.
These people certainly don’t spend their Thursday evenings wandering through plate shops on Berwick Street, scrutinizing plates, and escaping the looks of a fake 30-year-old television host staring over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don’t know anything about anything.
Greenland shark, the longest living vertebrate animal in the world - video news
Scientists have revealed that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan among the vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who conducted studies on sharks, said that the record is thought to be between 272 and 512 years old, which is five meters long and belongs to a female.
The French court rejected the offer to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A court in France rejected a proposal made by Calais officials to demolish dozens of dermal shops and restaurants in the jungle camps where thousands of refugees lived.
In this week’s court hearing, Calais officials said the total number of people in the state’s camp selling many products ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, making haircuts, or selling tea or basic meals for 50 cents (40p) in exchange for several euros.
The governor of Calais argued that these sites should be destroyed because they created a parallel, tax-free economy and posed risks to fire and hygiene.
Helping groups explained that shops and restaurants are vital to the court, and that the free food offered by state-backed organizations and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that dermal grocery stores and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille said that there was no legal basis for the deportation of people operating the 72-store, but that the Calais Vali's concerns were also "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that bakers, cafes and restaurants play a much bigger role than just feeding people who live in “extremely dangerous conditions.”
These areas provided comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers, he said.
One of the places in danger of destruction, the non-profit Jungle Children’s Cafe offers 200 meals every day, gives English and French lessons, and here, hundreds of non-resident refugees in the camp are advised.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect this cafe, which is for children.
In a letter sent to the Guardian, it was stated that the shutdown "will be a disaster for some of these children who are eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that the population at the Jungle camp rose to over 9,000 (the highest number to date) after the number of arrivals during the summer period.
After gold in Fiji's masterclass, Britain won a silver medal in the seven rugby championships
Britain's impressive progress in the Rugby 7 Championship ended in the final on Thursday with Fiji, after a 43-7 defeat at Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a masterclass on grasping, rusting, side steps, support, running lines, and muscle strength to receive the first Olympic medal of any color.
After the defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-bad consolation prize, and can now be proud of the efforts they made in the opening tournament of the Olympics 7 where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, they may have found them in the semi-finals after the South African team defeated them by 7-5 innings.
But yet a Fiji in such form could defeat even a team of 15 people.
Though not very credible, perhaps the UK can find comfort in thinking that at least one Brit will wear a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
It was a very difficult journey for the UK.
Eight years ago, when they were working with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens Championship.
This time, they only lost one.
Although it is painful, the progress shown is truly astonishing.
Fiji has made a charming start, players have gone far beyond the attempts of the UK to get the ball.
It was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series champions moved 5-0 when Osea Kolinisao moved in from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced the right-wing falcon with another number.
The match was 12-0 and the United Kingdom had hardly touched the ball yet.
Mitchell's excellent intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from dropping third, like a mountain, but this was only to delay the number of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and the United Kingdom fell 17-0.
With only one minute left to finish in the first half, Nakarawa made another number from the start.
Vatemo Ravouvou later flew in line for the number, passing through some of the difficult British interventions.
With this number, the circuit reached a score of 29-0.
While a team was set up to play in the Fiji 7 Championship, it was as if Britain was still trying to learn the basics of the job.
That's how it goes down.
Great Britain made major changes between the circuits and closed the Fiji dam; for exactly four minutes, which was a good development by the first half until Joshua Tuisova came on the scene with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton made a test for the UK and even though he tried to score 36-7 from the left corner, the game's fans were in the hands of the South Sea Islands, who sang, waved, and danced.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's joyous approach from beginning to end.
Maa Viliame also found his latest additions to the Fiji game, which doesn’t have to be decorated at the last minute.
When the duo played, the Fiji began the celebrations, and the British took the way to the dressing room in a manner that was infuriated.
At the start of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and Britain faced South Africa in a tough semi-final match; Britain came out with a single number.
Although Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, Dan Norton took the lead in the second half with his head-turning foot moves.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in England's top 15, was guaranteed victory and a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coach’s fight against cancer, run to the podium
There won’t be a more emotional gold medal in these games, and that has an important meaning.
After 220 tormenting breaths from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold at Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
While there were two men on board, there were three voices on the boat; the women were the first women to reach this level in this year’s doubles race in England, as they progressed to the second gold medal behind the back.
Their dominance was quite clear; this was the 39th race in the invincible series of their wives.
While we see two great athletes filtering on the surface in the elegance of the pool, this image does not exactly reflect the quality of the victory.
Behind each ball of gold, there is a clutch of willing hands that provide the increased gains that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as the coaches who didn’t know if he would live long enough to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
As he said, they touched it and left.
I got bladder cancer of the kind that could be treated with surgery, and they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
This changes your view of life a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was three times so lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of the season, it is not known if he would be right in such cases, but this way he would minimize the distraction.
I had to get paid, so I had to recover quickly.
This was an incentive for me.
Even though I was in the hospital and they said that taking a few steps was enough, I was walking in the garden up to 6, 9, 15 meters.
That's how it started.
Pulling the fur is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, his mind was in Williams, who spoke a little more than usual to overcome his own concerns, having spent a tense morning.
Stanning, who is a captain in the Royal Gunners' Union and has been to Afghanistan before, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little bit extreme but it really makes a lot of sense."
This once again highlights what it means to me and how much Helen, me and Robin worked.
I had a great three years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't, so I want to thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The duo have a difficult rhythm that their rivals can't reach.
Even in the last 500 yards between New Zealand and Denmark teams, the power of Stanning and Glover had not been exhausted.
We've captured that motherfucker.
Helen used to call it "watch the process, watch the process."
It's really important to be locked up or not.
We had a good start and we weren’t trying to do anything incredible.
We didn’t expect the light bulbs to explode today, we just wanted to win the race we went out with a good pitch, and we did.
The couple will take a break a year before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month; the wedding of herself and television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was very new and I was very stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
It's a much better feeling."

Bulgaria Explains Inflation Values for the First Time in 8 Months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was at 1% in June.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012) and the first value seen above zero since October, after a positive 0.2% last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, or 1.0% of monthly inflation.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate difference (compared to July 2016 and December 2015) was -0.2% and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, price increases were observed in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 percent), transport (1.8 percent), entertainment and culture (6.3 percent), restaurants and hotels (1.2 percent), luxury goods and 0%.
Prices fell in the clothing and footwear (2.2 percent), furniture, household equipment and routine care (0.5 percent) and health (0.1 percent) groups.
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices in communication and education groups remained at the same level.
Snapchat's "Anime" Effect Criticized as an Asian Caricature
While Snapchat says it’s inspired by anime for this filter, some observers say it’s racially insensitivity.
Snapchat allows around 150 million users to play with their identities at an absurd level by changing the reality every day with their lens tool.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Merchandise is an unbiased, feature-changing tool that creates over 30 million improved self-esteems every day.
Mistakes are quickly excavated in the public memory.
Snapchat lenses have faced accusations that the app has in the past supported black classification or offered whitened skin tones as beauty ideals.
For this reason, because of the lens they presented this week, which makes users snug-eyed, broken teeth and swollen sores, some critics criticized the company for being an “Asian mask” that caricatures Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring conflicts signaled a larger problem with the company’s diversity.
News and anger spread with news from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday and announced that it had removed the Snapchat feature a day later.
The company said in a statement that Mercek was not prepared for the cartooning of Asians, but for anime characters.
But for observers with experience of racism, this lens reminded me of painful stereotypes.
Other people generally refused to compare the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-born American art student who shared a tweet about the photos, said in an email that the lens was “painful and disturbing with the slightest expression.”
He added that when it comes to comparing the effects of the filter side-by-side with the bad Asian cartoon, it is difficult to argue.
This shows that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also an Asian mask on a degrading level.
Snapchat is not the only company that goes beyond cultural triggering mechanisms.
American culture seems to be in an endless conflict over diversity and content in so many areas, from the meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And what Snapchat is talking about can be interpreted in the way that the broader young audience, which is more of a racial diversity than other opponents, can also be within a higher sensitivity expectation.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said when one of Snapchat’s lenses created a small demeaning image for a user, “it’s much harder not to notice such movements as they used to be.”
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called everyone in that direction.
In an article he wrote for Medium and in an interview by phone, he stated that he believed race-related conflicts reflected shortcomings in Snapchat’s recruitment practices about diversity.
Ms. Zhu, criticizing the majority of the company’s leading team of white men, ended her article with a tag: <0x23>SnapchatiShift.
Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-American, said: “Either they can make such decisions because there are not enough diversity among their staff, or even if there are people who work there and belong to different races, they don’t feel safe or comfortable enough to speak for themselves.”
Other observers also share their views on this complaint, which Snapchat itself largely left unanswered.
The company does not share figures related to the diversity between the staff, emphasizing the state of the private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share the racial origins of its staff but, according to a spokesperson, the company recently added a recruitment responsibility to boost its efforts to focus on populations that were not sufficiently represented and include them internally.
Ms. Zhu, for her part, said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding "I wonder if they need more users like us who can say that this is not true."
Congressional Panel Says Military Officials Describing ISIS Intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, a congressional panel reported that the U.S. Central Command officials have distorted intelligence reports about a more optimistic picture of the war on the ground than the events against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An interim report prepared by the Palace Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense Payments, a working arm formed by the Republican council chairmen, said that their superiors had "changed the assessments of the Islamic State among the American forces".
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Florida and overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a news bulletin on the report, the statement reads: “The intelligence results confirmed by the senior Centcom leaders are typically more positive than the facts in the field on U.S. counterterrorism studies show,” and is more than consistent in analyzing and continuously analyzing their intelligence collection.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, “What is happening at Centcom is unacceptable; our combat units are in trouble when bad analysis is being presented to top decision makers.”
The leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also detailed the Central Command’s description and analysis of U.S. training efforts for Iraqi forces, which included details of the ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered the changes to the reports, analysts are more optimistic about the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and Daesh.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack on Muslim withdrawal could be carried out as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, Republican Kansas Representative Mike Pompeo said, “After months of research, this matter has been quite clearly understood.”
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the U.S. Central Command manipulated the commander’s intelligence results in order to launch the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq as insignificant.
After the Republicans learned that analysts expressed their concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about the Islamic State, they formed a working arm.
As reviews continue, the report, which was published on Thursday, will follow much more comprehensive findings.
There is also another Centcom intelligence review, which is being conducted by the Department of Defense Inspector General.
The Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee also published their findings, which participated in some of the findings of the Republican working party on Thursday.
In a statement, Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said, “Centcom has created an extremely narrow-minded process in evaluating intelligence on the United Arab Emirates, the United Arab Emirates and the Iraqi Security Forces between 2014 and 2015.”
According to Mr. Schiff, the process “delayed the publication of the intelligence results,” led to moral disruption among analysts, and “not enough room for opposing views.”
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had not reached a finding that the White House’s analysts were putting pressure on the White House to invent the results of “pre-determined or political narrative.”
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a general review of a Pentagon inspector opened following complaints made by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, as a Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as the Inspector General’s review continues.
However, he said, “experts may disagree on the interpretation of complex data in some cases and the Ministry of Defense supports healthy dialogue with the intelligence community on these important national security issues.”
The investigation will spark further reflection on whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is continuing (this is a remark made by more and more Defense officials every day).
But last year’s accusations raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticisms of the Islamic State’s intelligence reflectiveness have been succinct since its inception of a small force in Iraq, and since its inception in 2003, in which President George W. Bush’s administration advocated Gregory Hooker’s tenure after the occupation.
Mr. Hooker has also played an important role in the Islamic State intelligence insurgency.
Authorities said Mr. Hooker's team had built temporary refineries to sell oil at the black market despite public statements last year, noting the group's financial resources, despite the fact that they had built temporary refineries to sell oil at the black market.
However, according to The Times in September, this finding was not outside of the Central Command.
Last year, the then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized for being seen by many lawmakers as an extremely positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and took his place in Central Command, General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Women's Lawn Hockey Team Prepared to Meet Britain Wins 4th Victory
Katie Bam, a day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan, threw the first two goals of the U.S. women's grass hockey team in Thursday's 3-0 defeat of the Americans to India.
Although five goals in two games seem to require a permanent mastery in mind, Bam (27) said he was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who keep their scores.
What he knows is that the Americans are in the lead 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and share the first rank in the group with Britain, who continue on their way as champions after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face each other for the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have won the quarter-finals, and the match will determine who will be the first and who will finish the team's six-team matches.
The team that finished first in group matches will not face the strong Dutch team, the leader of another group, for a little longer when the quarter-finals start.
But after Saturday's match, the Americans made a sensational appearance here, showing a surprising progress after the last of the 12 teams to come in after the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 years old when he first took his lawn hockey stick (his twin sisters were interested in the sport at Drexel) and became the team's youngest player by joining the national team at the age of 16.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to enter the final squad.
Then came the year 2012 where most things didn’t go well for him and his teammates.
The following year, a British coach, Craig Parnham, was hired and things began to change.
"It's a cultural change, it's a mental change, it's a physical change," Bam says.
We don't work like we do in London anymore.
We've completely gone through transformation.
On Thursday night, Bam picked up the first number of the first tomorrow with a near inverted shot.
India had not yet won the tournament, but the team managed to keep the score 1-0 until the third quarter in which Bam entered the tournament, showing an astonishing level of stamina.
He made a long run with the ball from the left of the field and then curled up and threw the ball into the castle and led the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored her last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first game that Jackie Briggs, the United States goalkeeper, did not score in the tournament, allowing a goal in the first three wins.
Chances have been made.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline Coolness Amid Olympic Ambitions
Wherever you are, no matter how many hours, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work, and as if it will never end or be avoided.
The Olympic torch itself is like a fiery baton transmitted from there to the gymnast to the triathlete.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps can’t watch TV without hearing about the fight between Chad and Clos, can’t read the newspaper, or can’t listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who attended the Olympics for the first time, might be one of the names shown in prime time hours, among sponsorships and TV commercials that advises you to feel good about yourself, such as a swimmer, gymnast, or sniper.
However, Mr. Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California is fighting for the gold medal in the trampoline at the Olympics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event on an equal level.
Far from the center, there are sports that are not universally recognized in the shadows: cool gunfire, archery, badminton, tekvando.
The frog will always be with us, with the wish that it will be for a long time.
But if I have to mention my favorite, I would like to draw attention to the secret magic of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been recognized as an Olympic event since 2000 when it was introduced at the Sydney Games, very few of the people I asked in the next 16 years did realize it was an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes for the race, it did not win any medals in the trampoline and did not have a competitor rising to the finals until 2012.
The rewards in men were Chinese and Russians, and in women Chinese and Canadians tended to share.
Rosie MacLennan from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to keep the gold medals they received in London this year.
However, trampoline attracts attention as a rather insignificant activity; this may be due to the fact that it is thought to be worthy of clown school instead of the Olympics in partially unconscious ears.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the subject.
It has a funny potential (like the cartoon-like vibration created by never-ending jumping), but it also reflects the splendour of gymnastics and diving, which are basically the two sports it brings together.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish word hand trampoline, which means "tramplen".
Champion nominees jump almost 30 feet from the air in a large trampoline and are asked to make a series of moves (slope, pike and salto) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed for performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 16 men from 17 countries, 16 women will compete in thirty-two athletes.
The most common progress seen in the Olympics is that of direct progress.
Those who hope to receive the medal should go further, faster, and upward in some cases, upwards, upwards, upwards, upwards, upwards, upwards.
They’re not just after the finish line or the starting wall, but there’s also another challenging line on television broadcasting; the world or the Olympic record.
This determined effort is noble, noble, and even at extreme levels; it is enough to drown even an audience in their tears.
But this is exactly one of the features that I find slightly tiring while watching the Games.
Tramboline allows you to take a break from all of these.
Those in the trampoline are moving upwards.
Their goals are not moving forward.
He jumps upwards, looks weightless like an astronaut, comes upwards, comes downwards, and comes up effortlessly again.
Of course, it can’t be said that there is no competition or difficulty, but there is no loss in distance, just as time and land capture are elegantly suspended to achieve the result during the routine.
The colder an Olympic race can be, the colder it is.
Women's rankings and then finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 13.00 Eastern time; men's on Saturday again at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as a block from 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be overlooked in the general work.
And, according to The Wall Street Journal, if consciousness increases by offering male athletes just to crawl and objectify, as men's gymnasts recently suggested, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans.
In Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States, a "generation of protests"
Violence-intensive protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have come across the government’s fierce resistance.
Witnesses say a large number of protesters have received deadly gunshot wounds in the conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable nations and a strong ally for the West with its rapidly growing economy.
But the anti-government protests that have taken place in recent months have shaken the country every day.
Just last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s reaction to this was rather ruthless.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed a large number of unarmed demonstrators.
The images of the protests, thought to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show security officials smashing young people who have to stand against a wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHRC) is now calling for a detailed review.
Rashid Abdi, director of the Somali Peninsula Project of the International Crisis Group, said: “It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward.”
Ethiopia is one of the highest nations in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, including Somalia, and there are very few countries in Africa that have seen such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is growing in an impressive way.
The infrastructure has been effectively improved; a new suburban train is also available in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy is not on display in Ethiopia (human rights groups are constantly referring to the oppressive attitude of the government), domestic opposition was rather limited in the country, and the opposition was effectively silenced.
Most were sent into exile, thrown into prison, killed, or driven to the farthest corners of the desert.
But this situation may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from Central Ethiopia, said: “If you don’t drown people and you don’t give them any other option than protest, it’s going to happen.”
Youth is in complete protest.
A generation of protests.
There are many complaints, from land use to pressures from the ruling coalition on power.
After last year’s highly critical election, the ruling party and its allies also took the last seat filled by the opposition and are now able to control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea, the mosaic and conflicted line that led to the war that killed hundreds of people in June, are also on the rise.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have disappeared in recent years, such as the Oromo Freedom Front or the Ogaden National Freedom Front, will be rearmed by resigning from this turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why the painful emotions that have been boiling beneath the surface for years are now exploding.
The first one looks innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones spread and internet service became available, only a few years ago a large number of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often did during the protests, most people were able to communicate through Internet proxy servers that hide their locations.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in this way for protests.
Secondly, the solidarity between the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amhara, also increased.
Oromols and Amharas are not normally allies.
For a very long time, Amharas from the predominantly Christian mountainous areas of Ethiopia had been exploiting most of the Oromo, which were Muslims and lived in flat lands, leading in politics and business.
But this is also changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said: “We are gathering under a umbrella and moving forward towards cooperating.”
The largest protests were seen in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which is dominated by the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr Meles served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
It was thought that he was a tactical genius who saw that not everyone could see.
Analysts say he is particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of unrest and in reassuring and deactivating competitors.
Conflict analyst Mr Abdi said: "The current regime does not have this basic information."
Ethiopia's new prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn was elected in relative uncertainty to fill Mr. Meles's place.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who is from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he can’t gain the trust of security services controlled by the Tigers himself.
As a result, more blood was shed with more fear.
Ethiopia’s latest experience of such a turmoil was a protest in 2005 following the thefts of thousands of analysts by the government after an early election.
In the follow-up measures, however less than in the past month, many protesters have been killed, and this period of confusion has also passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning and record-breaking progress in combating poverty, such as the new suburban train.
But it is clear that this does not stop the increase in quinine heard against the Ethiopian government.
And it's getting a dangerous and ethnic situation.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and Tigrayan hatred is also on the rise on social media.
Analysts say the protests left the United States and other allies in the West in a strange situation.
The U.S. government was using Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft flights over neighboring Somalia, but it was recently reported that the base was closed.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want this ally in an already fragile region to be fragmented either.
Mr. Abdi said, "It's like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump Declares Obama's Proposition of ISIS as "Affair"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried several times last week to eliminate the latest controversy around his campaign, insisting that President Obama and Hillary Clinton claim that the Islamic State terrorist group is not serious.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican nominee’s ability to openly communicate with the American people.
At the same time, in the process that created this disorder, he put into a strange position in the process where they tried to explain to their agents that they did their best to defend him, that he implied that this was not the case.
Mr. Trump, after making the proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, insisted that the president and Mrs. Clinton actually implied that they had established ISIS, further strengthening Thursday’s thesis.
But in a post he made on Twitter early Friday morning, Mr Trump said he was only making a ridiculous statement.
His post indicated that Mr. Trump had taken a full step back the day before in a series of interviews he expressed his seriousness about the accusation.
When conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt recalled that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, when he tried to help Mr. Trump soften his remark, he said the Republican presidential nominee did not believe it.
Mr. Trump emerged last mess as he tried to change the mood of his campaign after the fall in polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made conflicting talks about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back on the subject.
Speaking again on Twitter, she said that Mrs. Clinton’s offers would raise taxes and found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump had used the mockery defense before.
By the end of July, after displaying an appearance suggesting that Ms. Clinton had hacked into her emails, she faced major criticisms, explaining these comments by saying, “Of course I said it ridiculously.”
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and step back where he needs to be.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language used by both candidates, said: "This is an arrangement that allows it to "explain" depending on how certain messages are reacted by those who support it themselves."
But at the same time, he consciously makes these statements and knows that it is unclear enough to be filtered when viewed from different lenses.
After a decline in polls in recent days, Mr Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance instead of softening the air for the general election.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed Mr. Trump was far behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and a tight race exists in Florida.
While Mr. Trump often avoids apologizing for the provocative things he says, he blames his critics for misleading or misunderstanding his humor.
But Mr Trump’s jokes, which have been subject to much more scrutiny in recent months of his presidential campaign, leave his loyal supporters in a difficult position to support his comments.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did his best to defend the candidate as one of Mr Trump’s most prominent supporters in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s thesis on Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton’s establishment of the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, “I think it’s a legitimate, political criticism.”
From a point of view, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, those who loved them were completely wrong, and this was because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to defend that the Obama administration, which Mrs. Clinton has been doing as secretary of state, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and is causing ISIS to grow.
In the run-up to meetings in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continues to accuse the media of smearing every word on Twitter and acting against him.
He joked with the “poor, pitiful” television experts who tried to solve himself, “They can’t do this!”
Some Democrats joked that Mr. Trump had argued that it was evidence that he was not fit for the presidency.
Once Upon a Time Unable to Start with Prices at Greenpoint With Us
Although Verb Cafe, a former cash-only hub in Williamsburg, did not offer Wi-Fi, it was offering great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, he couldn't handle the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the form of cupcakes.
The inhabitants of the area were close, stating that this was the last loss of the benevolent city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "It's a change in New York, I know it, but I still can't believe that CBGB is gone and Chelsea Hotel is vacated and Verb is no longer a soap shop."
But New York is the city of reinventing change as much as it is.
Last November, a refurbished Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location, in the north.
The new Verb Cafe has a Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit cards but retains some of its former employees and similar simple air.
The coffee is still good.
At the beginning of New Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, the owner and general manager of the new location, the long-time employee of the old cafe.
He joined Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.
When a customer offered him funding for this new location, he said he would be thrilled to do so.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left most things the same.
Verb used the same distributor for the simulators and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even the lights of the old Verb were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer some different experiences.
He added new materials.
Pastry-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are also available on the menu and include ingredients such as caper and sold onions.
They've got brown-pink cups.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he realized that the old medics had begun to come in a determined manner.
“Many of our former customers couldn’t cope with the prices in Williamsburg,” he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Ms. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and frequented Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he didn't give up on this path.
After the verb was closed, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized what I liked was the coffee and culture in Verb,” he said.
Now he started drinking coffee again but the other day he chose a new blend of tea, which was a new addition to the usual iced coffee.
Another drug addict, Tom Rosenthal, has been going to Verb on a regular basis since 2003.
He goes there before work and always gives the same order.
“Every day, around seven-quarters of a mile, I would go in without any surprise and they would prepare my daily order of butter simit,” he said.
The photo said Mr. Rodriguez wanted to make a change and added new materials to the menu.
These days, although Mr. Rosenthal is still taking his usual order, he sometimes makes some changes to his every-day simit order by adding pasta, eggs and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't confined to the soap shop that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe's cold brewed coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint adopted this café as well.
One of the new customers translated the menu to Leh<0xC3><0xA7>e and Mr. Rodriguez said that he would soon find an area to display this menu to make his new neighbors feel good too.
My new position also has other advantages.
The local fruit juice shop wants to bottle and sell cold-dried coffee.
There's a possibility that the cafe will expand to the building next door.
It is enough for most customers to have a new Verb where they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very upset after the place was closed.
When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said he felt at home that he could go inside and get coffee.
"I should have smelled it," he said.
The Depressed Food of Crisis in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, just after sitting in the Presidential seat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, who was fond of his throat, loved the delicious Fifth Avenue food such as goose lung soup and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu of the day was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, potato puree, and dried fried pudding as sweet.
Jane Ziegelman said: “This was an act of building solidarity with people who are struggling with eating.”
His wife Andrew Coe added, “This was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights, a food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book, "97 Orchard," also talked about her life in the nightlife in the Lower East Region.
The new book, "A Square Meal", which they work together and will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the story of the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They also met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet, located in the Flatiron region, which has been in existence since 1929, when the crisis began.
While Mrs. Ziegelman (54) was ordering a sandwich with cream cheese and olives, Mr. Coe (57) preferred to sit down with hints, potato purees and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's order for a roll of coffin suitable for discussing crisis meals.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The monkeys were very popular."
He had a peanut butter, a lung butter, a dry bean butter.
They were made of something cheap that spreads the material with a material.
Think about eating enough peanuts at dinner for you.
Mr. Coe, you've got a pretty face.
"He must have been sitting on a man's stomach like a crow," he said.
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the tables in America were like an open buffet.
The women cooked food for the men who worked on the farm, and freshly baked cakes were served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Americans were sending food to the Europeans who died of starvation in World War I. "A Square Meal" explains the history of the nation's methods of coping with the sudden departure from being a center of prosperity.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it, saying, “This was a time when food became a centerpiece for Americans, a worrying subject.”
The new budget regime was equally worrying: Mysterious foods such as nozzles and pots became the primary consumer product, as Ms. Ziegelman noted, "the closure of remaining dishes was a wonderful method for evaluating them with a work-in-professional finish."
It took dried fruits, which were cheaper than fresh fruits.
Over the years, meat, which is at the center of American cuisine, has become an attitude of shared luxury.
Interesting mixtures were tried for calorie and nutritional value, and the feeling of satisfaction preceded the sense of taste or general cuisine.
Ms. Ziegelman, while researching for the book that included recipes, prepared the peanut butter from that period in a full-bodied onion oven.
Mr. Coe said, "It wasn't a favorite contribution to dinner tonight."
Ms. Ziegelman backed it up: "It was real."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with onions in the oven.
This was a prominent feature in most home economics recipes.
Among them, the House economist Louise Stanley, who was responsible for the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, guided the country’s eating habits as never before, between 1923 and 1943.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be “saving” and spread the struggle to turn potato-creamed spaghetti-like snails into delicious foods.
"A Square Meal" is a feast consisting of historical delights.
The responses given by President Herbert Hoover to the hungry citizens by the government, such as the attitude of cake-eating, are extremely appetite-hungry.
He was on the one hand eating simple Iowa farmer meals in his public childhood, while on the other he was transforming into a millionaire intellectual.
Mr. Coe said, “He loved to eat European cuisine flavors like salami sauce.”
He was eating in a dining room almost entirely covered in gold, wearing jackets suitable for his dinner.
It's far from the realities.
If his wife Eleanor hadn’t encouraged him to be an example to his stomach, President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake.
According to the book, by employing an assistant who never cared about the taste, Mrs. Roosevelt began to serve not only "the saddest food prepared so far, but also the most nutritiously prepared plates" at the White House.
After the country resurfaced, most of the methods of cooking in times of crisis were put aside.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, a calorie- and nutrition-oriented understanding and science-based approach to cooking continues.
While writing the book, the couple stated that Ms. Ziegelman’s mother learned a lot from her eating habits – for example, she could never throw food in the trash.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really scared him."
Ms. Ziegelman said of her old memories: "It really made people sick."
There was a creamy sandwich case.
After the plates were collected in Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe brought out a candy they had prepared at home: the dry candy that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "This is called a beaten dry erik," adding that the most frequently applied number was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
There was no cracked cream; just dried peas, some flour, sugar, water and garlic.
Everyone dubiously dipped a spoonful of brown sticky mushrooms.
Surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoons.
Like someone who could save money, he said to his wife, "It'd be nice to have a little bit of chopped walnut."
He will receive Gilead lawyer fees in the fight against Hepatitis C patent with Merck
According to the U.S. District Judge’s decision, Gilead Sciences Inc. has earned the right to receive attorney’s fees in connection with the hepatitis C patent case with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After U.S. judge Merck found that he was misbehaving in a number of ways, including false testimony and other unethical practices, Gilead obtained less than 200 million patents from Sovaldi and Harvoni for the major success of Gilead's drugs in June.
U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman on Thursday said he was entitled to compensation for fees incurred during Gilead’s trial defense.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, the market leader, with next-generation hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case is based on the 2013 case of Gilead and Merck claiming ownership of the laboratory studies conducted for sofosbuvir, the active substance in Gilead's medicines.
U.S.-backed forces say Membic’s control was taken entirely from the Islamic State
On Friday, the group spokesperson said U.S.-backed forces had completely taken control of the northern city of Membic, near the Turkish border, by the latest Islamic State fighters inside the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) is also in the process of clearing the city after a group of militias that remain hidden in the city.
Sharfan Dervish, from the Membic Military Council in alliance with the SDG, told Routers that they had released civilian hostages over 2000, which were in the hands of their militants.
He told Routers, “The city is now completely under our control, but we’re running clean-up work.”
The Clinton family earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid federal taxes at 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton on Friday announced a 2015 tax return showing Democrats earning $10.75 million last year and paying a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent that is in effect.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to its charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation, earning about $5.3 million from former President Bill Clinton's speech fees, and ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs, who came out of the meat mills to the United States Department of Homeland Security.
Clinton's running mate, US Senator Tim Kaine, from Virginia, issued a 10-year tax return with his wife, Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid 20.3 percent of federal taxes.
Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, “Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency.”
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses for explanatory promises to his tax returns and stepping back.
Although it does not require laws, it is a tradition for US presidential candidates to publicly submit tax returns.
Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, said the reason for the refusal to publish statements was an audit conducted by the Revenue Administration.
Clinton campaign official Ian Sams tweeted "It's your turn" in connection with the Democratic nominee's statements.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel for the case, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the checks are complete.
The group, which criticised Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans in 2012, also cited questions about the very essence of this rejection, its contributions to charities, business deals, and many other ties with Russia.
On Friday, Clinton went on to this situation by posting an online video showing top-level Republicans applying pressure to Trump to explain their taxes.
On Thursday, he voiced the problem in an economic speech in Michigan.
He told the crowd, “He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for ten years, to publish his tax returns.”
Politico reported that Trump had paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business department shared with the corner writer a series of tax attorneys and accountants that the situation may still continue that way.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the presidential election.
Clinton offered a rulebook called billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would allow at least 30 percent of those earning over $1 million a year to pay taxes.
President Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton meeting in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hathaway group challenged Buffett, who operates there, to come to Trump and file a tax return.
Buffett said he was also undergoing IRS scrutiny and that Trump was “afraid” of voters, not from the tax authority.
Clinton has published tax returns in his campaign until 2007.
The Clinton family, currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the unified tax rate reaches about 40.5%.
The Clinton family’s 2015 declaration shows that, unlike most Americans, their income comes only from wages of $100.
The main investments are a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has declared that their yield and interest income is $109,000.

Powdered red pepper condoms, chestnut chips support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw powdered condoms full of red pepper at them.
The method has been proven effective, and the U.S.-based Union for Nature Conservation, founded a few years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation, has taken steps to introduce it; the violence of protecting volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania from starting to use their homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
Damian Bell, managing director of Honeyguide, said in a statement: “Since we’ve developed the toolkit, we’ve seen a change in attitudes in these communities; now they can have more confidence that elephants can stay away from their lands without harming elephants.”
The first two steps include holding the flashlight and playing the horn.
In cases where this is not possible, the so-called "red pepper cloud" is thrown away.
The powdered red pepper, mixed with the soil, is placed in a condom with a chestnut chip, only the tip is closed so that the fume remains open.
When it burns, the condom opens with an explosion sound, and the air is dusted with red pepper.
Even a breath is enough to send elephants in the opposite direction.
The last thing to do is to use a spark that throws a flash of air into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker hits the ground from a hotel in Berlin that removes Israel's phone code on Arabs' "taleb" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone code and that the employee was promoting the "demands" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the Holocaust documentary, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin with an open letter to the German news agency FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel during his recent stay.
However, the country was not among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, how could Israel be purged and destroyed in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
It was Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to search Israel through its own call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception to get a description.
Lanzmann wrote that the response he received "shocked him".
The hotel’s secretary said the measure was taken with “a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski-Hotels”.
The reason behind this move has caused the filmmaker to be much more upset.
According to Lanzmann, “Most of our conversations have asked Arabs and Israelis to erase the code.”
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the situation as “a great shame.”
This situation has shocked us and surprised us so much.
That's a real shame.
It's a far greater wonder that this has happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain.
It doesn't have to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusions from this.”
The incident aroused a huge reaction in the online environment; people described this as a scandal.
Some have accused Kempinski Hotel of "subduing" the so-called demands of Arab customers.
In another post, the expression "You should be ashamed" was highlighted that the hotel was located near a synagogue on Kurfurstendamm street.
According to Der Spiegel, the Hotel quickly dismissed these accusations by saying that the incident was the result of "indifference" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung said one of Kempinski's representatives had "never been directly ordered not to be included in Israel's rapid search list."
And now they've added the code.
Police used pepper gas and plastic bullets against Brazilian protesters
On Thursday, students gathered in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Brazil, to protest against reforms to the government's public education system, clashed with police.
Police used pepper gas and plastic bullets against the protesters.
The problem began when security officers tried to disperse students, which led to the police using plastic bullets and pepper gas.
Hundreds of students attended the show to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
The Sao Paulo governor, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed that fewer than 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of those who took part in the protests were seen writing against the walls of interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest took place days after protesters took to the streets in the form of masses to support the country’s disenfranchised President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a vote of no confidence.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased to 71% - RT Business
According to Levan Dzhagaryan, the lifting of sanctions and trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent year on year.
Since the lifting of the international sanctions imposed on Iran, the ambassador said that the interest of Russian companies operating in the country has increased significantly.
While new companies are preparing to provide market access, Russian companies are maintaining existing ties with Iran.
Of course, further increase in trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russia’s imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was provided by machinery, ground vehicles and consumables for weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran granted 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them for travel.
In addition, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia for the first time.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record that visited Russia last year will be broken.”
At the same time, he is visiting relatively fewer Russian Iran, which is an issue he hopes the ambassador will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Cash to FET<0xC3><0x96> from <0xC4><0xB0>zmir - Economic News
Interesting details about Abdullah Kavuk, Chairman of the Kavular Group Board of Directors, who was detained for providing financial support to FET<0xC3><0x96>, and Ahmet Kü<0xC3><0xA7>ükbay, Chairman of the Kü<0xC3><0xA7>kbay Group of Directors, began to emerge.
FET<0xC3><0x96>'s financial resources No. 1 and 2 in Izmir, Kü<0xC3><0xA7>ükbay and Kavuk's FET<0xC3><0x96>/PDY terrorist organization, were determined to send regularly monthly amounts of money by courier to Fetullah Gülen.
It was found that the money sent to Gülen was not deposited through banks, but sent by courier to the member of the organization.
On the other hand, nine people, including Fatih Alt<0xC4><0xB1>nay, the President of Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry, were arrested in Amasya, under investigation into the FET<0xC3><0x96> coup attempt, and seven were released on condition of judicial scrutiny.
Thirty thousand lire pockets in 10 years
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s call for “decrease the interest” has moved the banks.
It was suggested that banks should be included in the campaign attack, which was initiated by Real Estate and later by GYODER.
The proposal was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an to reduce the interest rate on housing loans rated as a psychological limit to below 1%.
Thirteen banks pulled their mortgage interest below 1 percent.
There were public banks that started the discount scheme.
Once the monthly interest rates ranging from 1.12 to 1.29 percent have been based on the latest regulation, the consumer using 10-year residential loan will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion TL.
TUESDAY 5 TO 10 YEARS
And how much advantage will interest cuts bring home to them?
A person using a 10-year loan of <0xC2><0xA3>100,000 will benefit from a decrease in interest rate of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000.
The vast majority of those who use housing credit choose a five to ten-year payment plan.
Interest rates are expected to fall even further in the coming days.
The sales of the discount will also have a positive effect.
In 2015, home sales increased by 10.6 per cent compared to the previous year, to 1 million 289 thousand.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year with a reduction in interest.
GYODER President Aziz Torun: It should be lowered to below 9% per annum
It is an important step for public banks to go to the interest rate cut.
They listened to our president's call and cut interest.
But this rate should fall below 9% per annum.
If this rebate process continues, we also plan to extend the 0.70 percent monthly campaign we started for a few months.
Lamb Group YKÜ <0xC3><0x96>zen Lammu: Our campaign can last 3 months
Participation of banks in this effort to bring vitality to the economy that we have limited as a month could lead to an extension of the duration of this historic campaign for at least 3-4 months.
But the interest rate on the loan needs to fall below 9% on an annual basis.
It is also gratifying to see that every sector is sacrificing housing, with the positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity that it will create in the real market.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a nice step for them to go to the interest rate cut on our president's call for banks.
In addition, there are a number of steps taken to revive the economy in all sectors.
The campaigns carried out by the STKs, the decisions taken by the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction for the country...
All banks have to put their hands under the rock.
Come to them and join us in this journey, we say to walk with us in the same way, together, let us give life to the economy.

Due to the "Regulation of Kabata<0xC5><0x9F> Meydan, Renewal of Shipyards with Transfer Center" run by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB), the Kabata<0xC5><0x9F> steamboats were closed to sea traffic for about two years.

Interest fell, the house collapsed.
The manager of a public bank sent a message to my friend.
It's always the same.
Interest rates are falling, house prices are rising.
Interest rates are rising, house prices are falling.
"Look, it happened again," he says.
He talks about his feelings because his work is about individual loans.
He says that contractors entering the 0.70 percent campaign organized by Real Estate have raised prices in many housing projects.
I checked to see if there was a fair share.
There's a shortage of sex, there's no more...
By the way, I thought we had a conversation with a contractor who attended the construction summit, organized by our newspaper, a week after the coup attempt by the Fatullahist Terrorist Organization on July 15.
The boss of a big company...
When I heard the tenant I'm not going to name his name, I said, "In fact, you have to raise 10 percent of the prices," "Are you going to take the opportunity to work?"
Following the strike attempt, the builders launched a large sales campaign with a 0.70 percent and 120 months duration with a real estate housing campaign.
I accept, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, he took the risk.
But as long as we act in a spirit of unity and co-operation, we will not cut Turkey’s pace.
The banks also backed your one-month campaign by lowering interest rates.
Then don't let anyone take the opportunity.
And warn them of what they do.

Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's reception, which took place closed to the press at the Presidential Palace, lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: Complain about those banks
The President of the Banking Regulatory and Supervision Authority (BDDK) Mehmet Ali Akben made a statement regarding President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s “recall of credit” warning to banks.
Akben said: “If banks turn the recall of loans into an opportunity because of the conditions of the market and do it at different rates, we will definitely not allow it.”
We ask those who bring such complaints and information to us, ‘By naming the bank and the company’s name, please contact the BDDK complaint line.’
President Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an warned the banks in a statement yesterday: "I say that when interest rates are falling, when the credit facilities are expanded, a new period will open up to both our country and our investors and our banks."
To stop giving up loans in this period of our country is to say that the banks that reclaim the loans on the basis of satellite excuses have set themselves a net worth, and I want to announce that.
At a rate of 7-8 per cent per annum, the banks also made money from this business.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
The President of the Professional Hotel Managers Association (POYD) Ali Kizildag, at the meeting held in the exhibition area of EXPO 2016 Antalya, announced that before the July 15 coup attempt, Turkey-Russia relations had entered a positive path, and that they had begun to fly from Russia to Antalya.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an and Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting excites the tourism sector, as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries, K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>g said, "I am proud to say that everything from tourism and agriculture to food, everything from textiles to textiles."
Turkey and Russia are two countries very close to each other, we have traditional relations based on years.
"I think that if we, as sectors, are making very rapid progress on this path opened by the leaders of the two countries, we can close the distances immediately and go towards the targets," he said.
K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>g, who expressed that they estimated that the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would exceed 1 million, went on to say:
But we lost a month in what we call the high season, so it's about reducing the target.
I still think if the charter flights start, we'll get over 500,000.
The season may be extended until the end of October or mid-November.
In such a case, additional flights may be placed towards Christmas.
I expect that this positive atmosphere will also be very well assessed by the Russian people.
They also have a desire for Turkey.
I hope with this impetus, maybe we'll force 700,000.
K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>ldag, who said they were hopeful for 2017 in terms of the Russian market, said that if the two countries' relations as well as the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could again rise to over 3 million next year.
The President of POYD K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F>, who stated that small domestic reservations started with the removal of the ban of public personnel, "there are returns in cancelled reservations, new reservations have also started to be received."
"We have a hopeful expectation about the festival of sacrifice," he said.
K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>g said that the lifting of the ban on the sale of tour tickets to travel agents by Iran after the coup was a very positive development, adding that “it would be better if we could bring 100 to 200,000 people from Iran in 1.2 to 2 months.”
Will you renew the existing loan?
First of all, find out how the new interest rate conditions that are in consultation with the bank that you are borrowing from are affecting your credit.
Calculate the cost of using a new loan at a lower rate with the early closing fee (usually up to 1.5-2 percent of the fee used).
If you are still advantageous when you include all the costs, you can apply for low-interest credit use.

Huseyin Gülerce: The collapse of Gülen depends on the collapse of 3 feet
Huseyin Gülerce, who interpreted FET<0xC3><0x96>’s coup attempt, made shocking remarks.
The lines from Hussein Gülerce’s explanations are as follows:
As I would have thought they would strike, for the last five or six months, I wrote that they can “try to do it, but they can’t do it in the chain of command.”
I don't know two things; the first is that this is widespread and profound, for example, the 8-year-old Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie and the successors of the President.
Mr. President, the person who struggles the most, who knows how to care for their puppets, but the most important feature of this is unheard of secrecy.
They're two-faced.
One of the most important proofs of "this is not the job a retired minister like FET<0xC3><0x96> can do" is that it's such a deep mess.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA, this guy was too early.
Mahmut <0xC3><0x96>vür said in 2014 that in 1971 they met Fetullah Gülen at the house of Vehbi Ko<0xC3><0xA7>.
The people who are most interested in these matters say that that period is the closest period to the relationship between the MIT and the CIA.
The U.S. paid the salaries of our armed forces personnel, and one man came out after he didn't remember them.
When we learn this, in 2014.
After Mahmut Bey's writing, there was no explanation to deny it.
For example, the fairy tale was caught, wasn't it?
I wonder who that is.
The man went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, returned two days ago.
He has traveled abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all of this together, it needs to be investigated; it needs to be investigated, with an excuse that since March 1999, when all the fugitives now went to the U.S. Fethullah Gülen, they all went to the U.S. with an excuse.
It would seem that they have gone to Pennsylvania with a curse.
But the actual contacts with the CIA can be detected from there; there have been many people sent to the U.S. in safety, especially from people who need to be upgraded from safety.
WikiLeaks is in documents; Laughing is setting up an association and it is holding joint meetings with the CIA.
Fifteen years ago, studies were done to formalize those connections with the CIA.
I said Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man in the prime minister is working for Fuat Avni.
But the bad thing is, this information fell to the CIA just as it fell to Pennsylvania.
The demolition of Gülen depends on the collapse of three legs; one of which we call the base, which was a friendship ring, there are those in very deep hypnosis, even they say that this coup attempt is still Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s film.
I was saying three feet, a base bracket.
The theft of questions, theft, defeat of the slave's right, this base's support was very shattered.
The other two feet; political support, international support.
International support is still in place.
The only thing that will break the political support is that Baykal and MHP executives document that their tapes have been pulled by FET<0xC3><0x96>.
After July 15, the "FET<0xC3><0x96>" also uses Mr. K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who opened everyone's eyes.
He's like, "I don't do it, he's doing it around me."
He says to me, "Oh, my lord Hussein, these girls have very different dreams, they send me, I've banned them now, because it's not right to do it with dreams."
One voice had fallen, the one speaking in that voice recording Barbaros Kocakurt: Teacher friends have dreamed, our Prophet double the tweets.
There was a police officer in Nusaybin.
According to the information received, the armored vehicle of the police carrying out patrol duty in the Salahaddin Ayyubi District was opened by terrorists with long-range weapons.
In the first open fire, a police officer was martyred and a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were rendered ineffective in the conflict over police retaliation.
The injured police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
There's an operation in the area.
TV broadcasts have not been interrupted.
On the night of July 15, private televisions, which played a significant role in preventing the coup attempt, continued to broadcast in Turksat thanks to a technical staff who heroically resisted the coups.
That's the hero I'm going to akk...
While reading the report on TRT, Akkaya said that they had entered resistance psychology by instructing the broadcast to be discontinued, "I took care of everything by thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire from the helicopter."
They asked me to put a gun on my head and cut off the broadcasts.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I told them we should go to the dish antennas and get them out of the building.
I spent up to 20 minutes in the area where the antennas were located.
"I cut some cables here again, but I didn't touch the broadcasts," he said.
When the strikers failed to stop broadcasting in Türksat, Samayolu brought in the experts of TV.
These terrorists were arrested by the police who arrived three minutes ago at the scene.
When the strikers returned to the building about an hour later, Akkaya, who had realized that the TV broadcasts were continuing by phone, and said that they had been living with death at the time, said:
I took over the night guard at 8:00 that night.
That's where we're at.
One of my friends was a security guard for the e-government and the electrical system.
At about 9:00 p.m., when we met for tea, helicopters passed over us, making low-flight flights.
There were a few more aircraft flying silently around the helicopter again.
We saw the lights.
It was probably unmanned aerial vehicles that could be captured.
They were flying in front of helicopters.
For the first time in 11 years, I've been looking for a charter because I've seen such a close flight.
Then a movement began.
When we looked at the news, we found out that the bridge was closed.
At the time, our general manager instructed friends who were not in the security position to come to the building.
We found out that all the packages of his TRT publications had fallen while we were going to the convention to get information.
TRT broadcasts were discontinued for five minutes.
I called the TRT main command but couldn't reach it.
Our control station said the TRT broadcasts were back and the report began to be read.
Our Deputy Director General Halil Ye<0xC5><0xBC>il<0xC4><0xB1>men requested that TRT broadcasts be discontinued urgently with the instructions of the Director General.
We started working to cut the broadcast because it broadcasted extensively from TRT 3 channel.
We've just heard that Prime Minister Binali Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m says "there's a rift."
Our director's 'Cut the TRT' order put us in a little resistance psychology.
We cut off the TRT, and after a while we heard the helicopter sound.
We went out, the helicopter went down to the station, fired everywhere, everyone was apart.
We hid in a building in the back.
We were 12 people in total.
When we got back from the helicopter, the soldiers came in.
A few of our friends were captured by soldiers.
And we came out so we wouldn't leave them alone.
At the time, I saw that they caught our assistant general manager and broke his knee.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
"Let's shoot one of them, they're scared," he said.
Then they put us all in.
The commanders began to shout, "Who is responsible here, I will never ask again."
When we heard 'let's shoot someone' speeches, we thought, 'We don't know about the country, but we've got an instruction, 'Certainly TRT.'
So there's a resistance.
At that moment, I felt I was giving up on my own.
I said "me."
I got up and didn't know what to do.
All I was thinking at the time was that my friends in the lineup were shot from the helicopter.
I thought 10 or 15 friends were martyrs in the procession, and when I thought, 'They're going to kill us in the end,' I was relieved.
The commander at the head said, "You're going to cut out all the broadcasts except TRT."
We have a system department that we monitor while we're broadcasting local channels.
We're broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels in the room.
I thought of this room.
There was no national broadcast among them.
If I cut them off and tell them that they're all cut, at least until then, support comes in and there's outside help.
Or I said go where you're going.
We agreed we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "Okay, I'll cut it."
I cut off the antenna output of one of the local channel packets.
I cut the power button to the monitors where we can watch the national channels.
There was no sign on all the screens.
I told her I had to go to the antennas to get her completely cut off.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the soldiers said, 'Stay there.'
He held the gun against me.
“You’re going to cut it all apart from TRT, there’s not going to be any left, I’m going to finally shoot one of you, that’s you.”
And I said comfortably, 'When you see it, it's all going to be frozen,' because I'm gone, I said nothing else.
We walked into the station, woke up, cut off the local broadcasts.
We've passed the other antenna.
At the time, I had a system that would correspond to close to 20 national channels.
Around 20 monitors have been discontinued by local channels.
Our Lord helped us so that we did not have difficulty in responding, nor did He bind their hearts.
They believed in the answers we gave.
They couldn't.
That's relieved us.
When they got out of the antenna, they asked where the transponder was.
"I don't know, I'm a TV broadcaster," he asked, "do you have an electrician?"
I said, 'There's no electrician after the evening, if there's a failure, the team will come.'
There was an electrician at the time.
I thought I didn't cut out the Cypriot broadcasts.
I've been thinking of cutting them off to smash the soldiers.
They were a little relieved because they thought the broadcasts had been cut.
They couldn’t look at the publications.
Now the group is waiting.
About an hour later, when they turned on the TV in the waiting room, they saw A News broadcast.
He's in, soldier.
"He said, 'Mr. A. He didn't stop the news.'
We've met the commander.
"Get up," he said.
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, “There are still broadcasts going on.”
"There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus," he said.
I said, ‘They’re broadcasting through Cyprus, we can’t do anything to them.’
“Then, after writing to someone, he raised us all up,” he said.
The attackers fled Turksat by minibus.
I saw from the pictures that the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water was executed in that van's seat.
They fired three shots at him and shot him in the back.
My friends also claimed to be the same soldier.
They were calling us the soldiers 'fighter'.
He's probably a soldier.
They may have been executed to get rid of it.
According to Asim Akkaya's statements, the first police team came from Gölba<0xC5><0x9F>a to Türksat.
When police teams found out there were helicopters in the area, they went back to the county to pick up ammunition.
They came back 40 minutes later.
When the police arrived, Turksat saw no one on the outside.
Just 3-4 minutes after the police reported that so-called experts sent from the Samanyolu TV came into the building, Akka said, "They called the police teams 'in, we're Turksat personnel, we need to get in urgently."
“The police were all of a sudden wrapped up in their phones and reported that we were ‘stuck in’,” he said.
The Spirit of the Mountain after Yenikap<0xC4><0xB1>
In early September, the AK Party will launch a large gathering of businessmen, artists, athletes and canadian leaders to Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Van and Mardin to build “bridges of will” with citizens in the region.
The AK Party is preparing to move the “Spirit of Uniqueness” to Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r after the bloody coup attempt by the FET<0xC3><0x96>/PDY.
The CHP and MHP presidents of the year will also be invited to the aid campaign in the eastern and southeastern Anatolian regions before the Festival of the Victims.
The AK Party, which will give the people of the region the message of "State and people with you" will help poor families and those in need.
The Gönülu Bridge Project, which was held for the first time in the month of Ramadan at the last MYK meeting of the AK Party, was discussed.
At the meeting, which evaluated the positive outcomes of the project for families in need, particularly young people and children, who were affected by terrorism in the region, it was decided to continue on the Day of the Victims of the Gönül Bridge.
The Vice-President-General began work under the chairmanship of Mehmet Müezzino<0xC4><0x9F>lu, President of Civil Society Relations.
According to this, 12 years in the East and Southeast will be gathered in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Mardin and Van.
Meetings will be held in these three years, which will be accepted by the center before the holiday.
The events will also be attended by businessmen, artists, athletes and canadian leaders.
At these meetings, the organization of aids and work will be discussed.
And on the Day of the Sacrifice, the tribes of famous names will bring their help to the citizens themselves.
Young people and children will be given holiday expenses, and school needs will be addressed in this way as the schools are opened after the holiday.
Victim meat will be distributed to those in need.
After July 15, the air of national unity, which formed against the coup between the AK Party, CHP and MHP, will also reflect this project.
The presidents of the 12-year CHP and MHP will also be invited to the organizations.
The three parties will be able to carry out their assistance activities together.
It is considered that the HDP will not be invited to the events, as in Yenikap<0xC4><0xB1>.
The father-in-law of Fairy Tales
On July 15, FET<0xC3><0x96>’s father-in-law, Adil <0xC3><0x96>ksü, who was shown as the number 1 of the coup attempt, was arrested and sent to the judiciary.
Kay<0xC4><0xB1>npeder Cevat Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m and Hatice Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m were released on condition of judicial review and ban on foreign exit.
Speaking at the judiciary, Cevat Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m called for his delivery to his grandmother and said: "I am with the state."
God bless the perpetrators.
As far as I know, I haven't really known the Fairy Tale I've known for 18 years.
I don't have a fairy godmother.
I want him caught a moment ago.
In this way he can neither live in Turkey nor in the world.
Come on, trust in Turkish justice.
If he makes a mistake, he gets punished.
He's making it hard for us to escape.
Too bad for the police, too bad for the state.
The police haven't done anything else for 20 or 25 days.
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m, stating that Turkey does not want to return to Syria, "We need to work, not for the coup."
We don’t want Turkey to be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
There's a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"What shall we do with our blow?" he said.
On the other hand, at the latest on July 19, at 03.00 hours, TEM Motorway Akyaz<0xC4><0xB1>, <0xC3><0x96>ksü, which was seen passing through the sheds, was involved in the losses after leaving his ‘SIR’ plated vehicle in Akyaz<0xC4><0xB1> in the garage of his father-in-law’s house.
FET<0xC3><0x96> operation to the university: 30 arrests
The Fethullah terrorist organization was pressed a button for the operation this morning as part of an investigation into the construction of a nun university in Izmir.
In an operation carried out by the Izmir Katiep <0xC3><0x87>elebi University of Izmir Department of Combating Financial Crimes, 30 of the 40 suspects were arrested at their addresses.
There are also professors among the names arrested in the operation under the instruction of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Izmir.
The names of those arrested were questioned by the Directorate for Combating Financial Crimes.
They're looking for other names.
The prosecutor who was arrested committed suicide.
According to the information received, the teams of the Provincial Security Directorate wanted to arrest the Prosecutor of the Republic of Viran<0xC5><0x9F>ehir, Ahmet Fi<0xC5><0x9F>ne, in the context of the investigation.
Fisne claimed that he would commit suicide by holding his gun in his hand.
Fishne refused to commit suicide by being persuaded by his officemates and his wife who came to the judiciary.
The arrested Fishne was taken to the Provincial Security Directorate.
Smoking ban in parks and sports areas
The mayor of Bilecik, Selim Ya<0xC4><0x9F>ci, said that at the signing ceremony held at the Sheikh Edebali Culture and Congress Center, they added an item to the Zab<0xC4><0xB1>ta regulation by decision of the City Council at the point of not smoking in the park, sports and play areas.
Recalling that they have met with all the administrators of the public institution regarding the future of the new generations in order to sign the protocol, he wished the protocol to be good for children and young people.
Yasin Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, the Provincial Director of Health, also reported that the protocol aimed at stopping people from smoking and removing young people from bad habits.
After the speeches, the mayor of Ol<0xC4><0xB1>c<0xC4><0xB1>, the Rector of Sheikh Edebali University Prof. Dr. <0xC4><0xB0>brahim Ta<0xC5><0x9F>, the National Education Director of the State, stopped the facility, the Provincial Health Director, Y<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>, the Provincial Health Director, the Provincial Health Director, and the Provincial Public Health Director, <0xC3><0x96>mer Balc<0xC4><0xB1>.
He saw the cucumber in Ergenekon, killed FET<0xC3><0x96>
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Ankara is investigating the role of FET<0xC3><0x96> in the mysterious death of Beh<0xC3><0xA7>et Oktay, the head of the private security apartment, which closed its "suicide" file in 2009.
Former Head of the Security Intelligence Department, Ramazan Akyurek, who stayed in the same lodge six days before Oktay died, was a suspected Hezbollah terrorist.
It is suggested that some of the ammunition seized under the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the FET<0xC3><0x96> security team from the Special Operations Unit, which was killed for detecting Oktay.
Ankara, which was shot dead on February 25, 2009, was referred to as the "intiharium" on the death of the then President of the Special Operations Unit, Beh<0xC3><0xA7>et Oktay.
But there were a lot of question marks in the case.
Two years later, following a legal battle between his family and his family lawyers and the evidence he revealed, a murder investigation was opened this time around.
The gun was said to have been shot by the left-handed Oktay himself.
He also had fractures in his bones and scars on his body.
The case concerning the murder investigation was opened in May 2012.
Only in the murder case, Halil Cutler, who was with him at the time of his death and found a trace of tobacco in his hand, was tried.
At the end of the trial, the cutter hesitated.
Nurhan <0xC3><0x96>nder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecution saying Oktay was involved in his death, was sentenced to six months in prison for "accepting crime and misleading the judiciary".
QUESTIONS FOR THE RIGHTEOUS
Meanwhile, when Hussein Yal<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>n retired, the prosecutor, who called the case "intihar", Mustafa promoted the Right Judge, who conducted the murder investigation.
The Oktay family, along with these prosecutors, wants the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m to be investigated.
Beh<0xC3><0xA7>et Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and his brother Nezih Oktay and his family lawyers made many demands during the trial.
The family, who said it was not possible for the Halil Cutter to kill the privately trained Oktay alone, asked for the investigation to be expanded.
The family, who said the incident was covered up, asked prosecutors Hüseyin Yal<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F>in and Mustafa Dük<0xC4><0xB1>n to identify and prosecute security officers who wanted to close the Beh<0xC3><0xA7>et Oktay file as suicide.
When all the family's demands were rejected, it turned out that Oktay was resting under the false name "Abdurrhamman Doru" as a member of the Hezbollah Terror Organization six days before his death.
The hearing was also carried out by the President of the Security Intelligence Department, Ramazan Akyurek.
On this development, the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Ankara reconsidered the Beh<0xC3><0xA7>et Oktay file and began to examine the finger of the Fatullah<0xC3><0xA7>i Terrorist Organization (FET<0xC3><0x96>) in the crime.
The trial in Ankara’s High Court of Criminal Justice for Oktay’s illegal rest will begin on September 19.
THE TABLE IN THE ARKASIN IS CLOSED
The Oktay family that SABAH is meeting is hopeful without the current investigation being carried out.
Members of the family say that during the previous demonstration investigation and trial, the FET<0xC3><0x96> finger in the murder was covered.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder actually showed up."
We couldn't detect it.
My brother said, 'They'll eat me before he's killed.'
I said "Kim."
Then he pointed to me FET<0xC3><0x96>.
I thought I'd be fired.
I never thought of death.
There is a fetus behind this, of course.
He said, “The government was in their hands.”
The young man called his family, joined his prayer.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, after speaking to the citizens in the President’s garden of Shulliyasi, in the last night before the attacks on democracy, through the AK Party’s Sinop MP Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Mavi<0xC5><0x9F>.
At 1:30 p.m., Father Fahrettin said that the phone was coming when they prayed for his son, "Our President also attended with his prayers."
"I also said that our country and his health are important to us," he said.
"THE HEALTH IS IMPORTANT TO US"
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke to the citizens in front of the Presidential Palace the night before.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an met with some citizens in Külliye after his speech ended in the middle of the night.
Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who walked with an elderly aunt who was on the cusp of democracy, spoke only with the citizens, took care of the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an later called AK Party MP Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Mavi<0xC5><0x9F>, father of Omer Can A<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>kgöz, the 15th of July, to Fahrettin A<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>kgöz.
The 21-year-old <0xC3><0x96>mer Can’s father, Fahrettin A<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>z, a TOBB University Law School student who was shot in front of the Presidential Palace, also prayed with our son and martyrs at 1:30 a.m., in prayer to President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an for his condolences.
I also said that our country and its health are very important to us.
"We are very pleased that our President has called and prayed on the phone," he said.
The pyramid of Fet<0xC3><0xB3> has fallen to the ground
26 FET<0xC3><0x96> were arrested in Izmir Urla.
Among the detainees, according to the statements of the victims, is the organization’s “promise” Naip Hepyal<0xC4><0xA7><0xC4><0xB1>n, which is referred to as bullying and threatens those who want to end their subscription to the newspaper Time.
In U<0xC5><0x9F>ak, FET<0xC3><0x96>’s guardian 20 sisters were arrested.
Among them, 24 people, including former Bursa Security Director Ali Osman Kahya, were sent to the judiciary.
DOCTOR'S SUPPORT
In Edirne, the imam responsible for doctors of the organization, Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n Tünbel, was arrested.
14 professors at Denizli Pamukkale University, 30 professors at Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University, 19 academics at Karabük University, and 2 academics at Rize’s FET<0xC3><0x96> lieutenant Hilmi Sandal were arrested.
In Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, eight judges and two deputy governors and two prosecutors were arrested.
One of the judges found out that the arrest took place in the courtroom.
In Batman, the deputy governor of the Ages has been revealed.
Two police chiefs of 465 police officers were arrested in Istanbul Police.
In Konya 51, in Kayseri 14, in Malatya 14, in Siirt 10 policemen and in Adana imam Naim S. were arrested.
Protecting the PKK who killed the people
For more than forty years, Turkey, which has fought a relentless struggle to end the PKK terror, has begun to face the day when it could not destroy the leaders of the organization in this struggle.
FET<0xC3><0x96> militants, who have infiltrated Turkey’s critical institutions, have worked to tie Turkey’s hand on all four sides.
At the point that came today, there began to be serious doubts and evidence that the murder of Hrant Dink, the Uludere incident, and the downing of the Russian plane were behind the critical events of FET<0xC3><0x96>.
THE SIZE OF HIS LIFE IS VERY CABARIBLE
During the July 15 coup attempt, it turned out that President Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s sicily of the FET<0xC3><0x96> General Gökhan <0xC5><0x9E>ahin Sönmezate<0xC5><0x9F>, who led the raid on his hotel in Marmaris and the assassination operation, was very rude.
Earlier, it had been determined that Sönmezatesh reported the air operations to the PKK while the planes were flying to the terrorists.
The investigations conducted by the intelligence units also found that Gökhan Sönmezate<0xC5><0x9F>'s sicily was obscure.
PROTECTION OF TERRORISTS
In addition to the leaking of intelligence to the PKK, it also came to the attention that the Turkish warplanes did not exactly hit the designated targets.
It was claimed that the point given by the terrorist organization Kandil on the fronts of the PKK’s leadership staff was avoided by Gökhan Sönmezate<0xC5><0x9F> being distracted by the targeting.
With the change of coordinates, it was determined that the PKK's leader's cadre of warplanes shot down places next to the targets, and so did the leaders of the terrorist organization.
In the intelligence review, it turned out that Sönmezatesh played a key role in both the diversion of targets and the escape of PKK terrorists from where they were before the F-16s flew.
Files of 37,000 officers open
At the instruction of the head of the terrorist, Fetullah Gülen, the process of restructuring was initiated at the TSK and the Ministry of National Defence after the ouster of the coup attempt by the FET<0xC3><0x96> members.
When it became clear that questions about entry to military high schools were stolen by FET<0xC3><0x96>, and that military students who were not members of the organization were sent from schools, a comprehensive cleaning process was initiated.
With the latest exports, about 37,000 officers are left from 39,287 officers, while cleaning for generals and admirals will also be carried out for these officers.
For this purpose, promotions will be frozen in personnel, especially from lieutenants to the rank of colonel.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers began to be opened alone.
With a forty-year study, FET<0xC3><0x96> mendesub soldiers will be revealed.
Officers who are not affiliated with FET<0xC3><0x96> will continue their duties.
While it is stated that the fight will continue until the last FET<0xC3><0x96> cleared from the army, the promotion of the officers will come to the fore only after the investigation.
The investigation is conducted jointly by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Security Intelligence and the State Inspection Board.
Under the investigation, the officers who opened the file are investigated by civilians or by completing the harp school, the promotions they received, the places they served and the commanders.
In addition, even on the basis of the rules, the FET<0xC3><0x96> will be investigated by a study that creates forty cases of whether they are members of the FET<0xC3><0x96>.
All measures will be taken to ensure that officers who have no connection to FET<0xC3><0x96> are not adversely affected by the process.
If the slightest suspicion is found, the officer will be immediately taken to court and brought to justice.
The FET<0xC3><0x96> link will be immediately cut off from the relationship with the army of those who have the right to information and documents.
While the promotions are frozen during all these operations, the review will be deepened.
Necessary measures will also be taken to prevent post-importation gaps in staff.
After undergoing a security investigation as they wish, those who are thrown out of the TSK and forced to retire with their FET<0xC3><0x96> boot will be able to return to their professions with the same right of deprivation as their peers and peers.
2 BY 133 SUBAY IMPACTED
The Presidency of the General Staff of the TSK announced the number of personnel as 39,287 officers on 1 July.
The majority of the officers in the lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, lieutenant, and colonel class were officers in the Black, Air and Navy.
However, in the first wave of exports on July 27, 726 of the Kara, 314 of the Air, and 59 of the Marines had been fired, including one thousand 99 officers.
In the decision of 31 July, 125 officers were cut off from the TSK, including 909 from the General Command of the Gendarmerie.
Pehlivano<0xC4><0x9F>lu: Turkish poisoned FET<0xC3><0x96>
The founder of the MHP and the first general president of Alparslan Turke<0xC5><0x9F>'s protections, retired Chief Commissioner Tahsin Pehlivano<0xC4><0x9F>lu, suggested that Turke<0xC5><0x9F> was killed by poisoning and that one of the family did so in cooperation with FET<0xC3><0x96>.
From 1977 to 1997, Pehlivano<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was with Turke<0xC5><0x9F> at every moment until he died, said: "I have not told anyone so far, but I have been charged with following the image of the soldier who cut off the helicopter of Muhsin Yaz<0xC4><0xB1>c<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu and remained in charge of killing our President."
Here’s what the Turks said:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We checked in three days before we arrived.
The 33-year-old Dr. Pikret, who checks up, says, "You look like an 18-year-old."
He said, "You don't have anything."
This doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My boss went to Amasya.
They called me back and they went to a wedding in Ankara Hilton.
After leaving the show, the Turkish driver says to Alparslan, "Open the rear window."
He wouldn't open glass in life.
When you open the window, it's like a sneezing sound.
First, they did a heart massage at Chankaya Medical Center, electro, but it was over.
We took him to your gentleman's medical center all along, but the job was over.
I think one of the family poisoned him in Amasya.
The turkey didn't have an autopsy.
His ex-wife, Seval Turke<0xC5><0x9F>, will have heard my awkwardness and my remarks, and he will come out and make defence statements like “Turkey was killed.”
A man digs a tomb, he digs a tomb.
They said they had a heart attack.
The turkey's tomb should be reopened.
Has Alparslan Turks been killed?
They were arrested while kidnapping gold in Pennsylvania!
Under 1.5 kilograms of weight in the organized operation for the construction of FET<0xC3><0x96>/PDY businessmen in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir, it was handed over during the shipment to Pennsylvania.
In the scheduled operation, searches at the workplace found 30 kilograms more gold waiting to be kidnapped into Pennsylvania.
The businessman Mehmet Eldem’s workplace was sent to prison after three people were arrested after gold was prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania, located in Eldem Kuyumculuk.
In addition, Mustafa <0xC3><0x96>zkara, Ezel Elected and Messenger Elected, who were arrested in the operation carried out in the framework of the investigation in Izmir, were arrested.
In the operation organized on July 29 by the teams of the <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Province Security Directorate for Financial Crimes, the Aegean and Western Mediterranean Industry and Business Federation (ES<0xC4><0xB0>DEF) <0xC4><0xB0>sulleri <0xC4><0xB0>sulti <0xC4><0xB0>sulti <0xC4><0xB0>sulti <0xC4><0xB0>sulti <0xC4><0xB0>sulti.
While trying to escape to Kyrgyzstan, <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Adnan Menderes Airport captured ES<0xC4><0xB0>DEF President <0xC3><0x96>zkara is the son of Osman Gürbüz <0xC3><0x96>zkara, one of the most important members of FET<0xC3><0x96>'s Aegean Region.
It was reported that the other businessmen who were detained on the grounds that they provided financial resources to FET<0xC3><0x96> were also seized at five fuel stations, which were owned by Ezel and the Apostle Elect.
In one hour, they stole three gasoline cars.
The incident took place last night in Kartal.
The two suspects first arrived in Kartal by car, after a gas station on the side road, 300 meters ahead of them, then looted another gas station on the side road with a gun.
The aftermath of the robbery, after the alarm, the Kartal police started a search operation by identifying the suspects in a short time.
The police teams tracked the C.S.A. and U.S.A. vehicles.
The suspects, who started to escape from the car they were driving from the cart, also shot the police.
One of the suspects, who was still in the situation after the hunt, was caught jealously on Egemenlik Boulevard.
According to the information he received from C.S., the police also caught the second suspect shortly.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison after their actions at the Kartal Asayi<0xC5><0x9F> Office.
On the other hand, the mask was recorded by robbery cameras.
In the footage from the gas station's security cameras, the suspect first goes into the gas station, then makes masks on the outside of the car, and then goes back to the market with his guns.
The first suspect to enter the market and the first market employee is confronted.
A mask and a gun on the head of another person next to the suspect who came out after the attack by a market employee comes in.
After decommissioning the gun-drawn suspects, he's on the run, taking <0xC2><0xA3>6,200 from the safe.
In the top search, the suspects seized about 15,000 liras, an unlicensed weapon, and the vehicle they seized from 3 stations.
Earthquake of 7.2 in the Great Ocean
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced that the main base of the New Caledonia Island earthquake was recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers (109 kilometers) east of the seabed.
The tsunami warning, which did not lead to the loss of life and property, was canceled shortly after.
Earthquakes often occur in Vanuatu, located in the "Pacific Fire Circle" earthquake range.
He made the prayer of the unfamiliar.
On the night of July 15, relatives of 38-year-old <0xC3><0x87>etin Can, who was martyred at the Bo<0xC4><0x9F>azi<0xC3><0xA7>i Bridge, are protecting their metadata.
His wife, Fatma Can, said that she learned in a conversation of her husband's "martyrdom prayer made in the month of Shavval" when she had not yet heard of the coup attempt that night, and that she had made a martyrdom prayer at home, and recommended that he make this prayer.
After the prayer, Fatma Can recounted that they watched the news on television in the evening and learned of the coup attempt, saying:
We got ready and went out together.
When we went to the bridge, there were people waiting.
As soon as he entered the bridge, the tank fired on us twice.
We took a siper, then went on walking when the tank went.
There was a big bus stop on the bridge.
It was so crowded.
We stayed there for a while and waited.
We thought about what to do when we can't move forward.
The <0xC3><0x87>etin asked us to cross the sidelines.
I'm guessing he was a sharpshooter when he crossed the sideline, we were a clear target, and he was shot there.
Then, after four hours of prayer, he prayed and prayed.
He didn't know anything about the strike.
The wisdom of God...
In the name of Allah, in the name of Allah.
My wife once said, "If I die, a tree will bear fruit in my grave."
I made this wish by planting a fig tree on the head of the grave.
Fatma Can noted that they owe thanks to President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an for visiting them as well, saying, “May Allah be pleased with him.”
His skull and bone fragments were found in the excavation!
According to the information obtained, at 8 p.m. in <0xC3><0x87>ankaya, at the intersection of the New Ankara Street and Co<0xC5><0x9F>kunlar Street in the Faculties District, during the work of the working machines to equip the electrical installation, bone pieces came out of the ground.
Workers and local residents reported the situation to the police.
Police teams were dispatched at the scene of the incident.
Police, who saw three skulls and bone fragments coming out during the operation of the work machines, informed the investigation teams.
After the work of the field examination teams, the bone pieces were placed in bags and taken to the forensic institution.
Residents of the neighborhood claimed that there was an old cemetery where the bones were removed, that overnight stays were made on the cemetery in the 1960s, and that the overnight stays were later destroyed.
Investigation of the incident was initiated.
Rita's killer's return may take four months
It was reported that after 34 days after the disappearance in Istanbul, the body of German hairdresser Rita Dar<0xC4><0xB1> Winkler (39) was captured in Germany after 4 months, the suspect's boyfriend could be returned to Turkey for 4 months.
Winkler arrived in Turkey on Thursday, March 3 to meet his boyfriend Ali Kemal S. (46).
After meeting Ali Kemal S. in Istanbul Pendik, he was involved in the losses while he was expected to return to Germany on Wednesday morning.
Investigations carried out by the Istanbul Police on her family's disappearance have resulted in suspicions over Winkler's husband, Ali Kemal S., who is married.
On April 13, Ali Kemal S. reported that Ali Kemal S. had excavated the Sweet Hard Program with Muge Anl<0xC4><0xB1>, which was published on the atv screens and was owned by his brother Huseyin S. and located in Gölcük.
A search was conducted at the workplace on the news.
Winkler's body was found buried on the floor of the workplace.
His brother Huseyin S. (42), who was deemed to have assisted Ali Kemal S. in the murder and gave contradictory statements in safety, was arrested.
Zanl<0xC4><0xB1> Ali Kemal S. was involved in the disappearances in Germany after the discovery of Winkler's body.
The Attorney General of Hamm said that Ali Kemal S., sought by Interpol in 190 countries, was arrested while walking down the street and was not resisting the police.
German prosecutors said they had not yet identified where the suspect was hiding, and that the process of returning to Turkey could take four months.
On the night of July 15, it turned out that the FET<0xC3><0x96> attackers fired on the mosque to silence the reading from the mosque next to Ak<0xC4><0xB1>nc<0xC4><0xB1> Base.
SABAH reached the conclusion of the complaint made by the imam of the mosque "in the name of the patrons" with images of the attack on the TAI TUSA<0xC5><0x9E> Mosque, which is the closest mosque to Ak<0xC4><0xB1>nc<0xC4><0xB1> Base.
According to the information received, the attackers began shooting directly at the speaker about 50 meters away shortly after they began reading the room in the room.
One of the bullets also hit the speaker's edge in honor.
When the strikers failed to hit the speaker, they were read until the end of the room given from the central system.
According to the scene's arrests, he broke through the door of the mosque to kill the imam and went inside with the attackers' postcards.
Mustafa S<0xC3><0xBB>ker said: "I have not personally been injured, but I want to be severely punished by those who can even shoot the mosque and martyr the people of Kazan."
Young people were killed by drugs at the festival.
Two out of five people who were hospitalized in the youth festival last week in Istanbul Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer lost their lives.
According to the information received, 5 of the participants of a youth festival held in Bah<0xC3><0xA7>eköy on August 6 were hospitalized, disturbing them.
Tugay Ergin (19) and Gökhan Alata<0xC5><0x9F> (19) lost their lives.
Treatment of three people is ongoing.
Police have arrested five people who were accused of selling drugs to young people who attended the festival.
Three of the five suspects who were sent to the judiciary were arrested following their security operations, while two were released for trial without arrest.
Research on the cause of death of young people is also ongoing.
Two of the six youths who camped and used drugs in the Burhaniye district of Bal<0xC4><0xB1>kesir also died by setting up a tent on the coast.
B.D. who was hospitalized, and G.C. lost their lives.
The other four youths were taken to the safety department to receive statements after their treatments.
A bomb exploded in front of his wife's house
The 41-year-old M.Y., who lives in Bursa, exploded a handmade bomb in front of the house where his wife, who left the house about 8-9 months ago, made her own effort and filled it with nails, boosting her punching power.
Due to the explosion that occurred last night, citizens were living in fear and panic, spreading bullets and pieces of nails around the house causing many of the windows of the house to be broken.
Counterterrorism teams have begun work to capture M.Y, who is reported to have escaped and been unemployed after the incident.
Neighbourhood residents said the woman left the house about a month ago due to pressure from her husband and moved into the shelter.
Explosion in prison in the Philippines: 10 dead
Xavier Solda, a senior investigator at the Jail Management and Penology Office, said two Chinese nationals lost 10 lives in an unidentified explosion at the Paranaque Prison in Manila.
Lefta, who stated that a guard was seriously injured in the blast, said: "We have confirmed that there was an explosion inside in the first investigations made."
"Research on the cause of the explosion is ongoing," he said.
When the inmates learned that they would be sent to another building before the incident, reports that they wanted to meet with the guard were examined, Lefta stated that investigators were investigating whether or not the explosion was part of an escape attempt.
Police official Jose Carumba also told local media that after the guard heard a gunshot, a handbomb exploded in the area, shooting at the prisoners.
Curumba noted that the authorities were investigating how the prisoners who shot the guard were placed in the gun prison.
The explosions in Thailand
Three people were killed in explosions in four cities in southern Thailand.
Officials said three people were killed in explosions in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, including 35 injured tourists.
Police spokesman Piyapan Phingmuang said at a press conference that the bombings were not linked to terrorism.
Phingmuang said, “Thailand has no regional or religious problems with anyone.”
"We think this is an internal sabotage act," he said.
Friday's leader Prayut <0xC3><0x87>an-o<0xC3><0xA7>a also told reporters that he did not want to comment on who was behind the explosions.
O<0xC3><0xA7>a said, “We must focus on ensuring humility, peace and trust.”
Last year, on August 17, 20 people were killed and 120 injured in the bombing near Erawan Temple in the commercial center of Bangkok, Rajprasong.
"Sleeping Wicked" Will Be Punished With A Toxic Needle
The 63-year-old Lonnie David Franklin, who was arrested for committing at least 10 murders in the U.S. over many years, has been sentenced to death.
Franklin, a former cleaning worker, was targeting life women and drug addicts in his murders.
Judge Kathleen Kennedy, who is facing Franklin, said: “I have never seen such a monster and so many violent criminals in my life like you.”
Franklin is said to be one of the bloodiest killers in California history.
It was learned that Franklin, who was convicted of deliberately killing 10 people and attempting to murder one person, would be executed with a poison needle.
Measures against FET<0xC3><0x96> in Macedonia
Macedonian Minister of State Furkan Chako said that they are taking steps to legalize the extensions of FET<0xC3><0x96> in the countries and initiate the necessary investigations.
Recalling that the organization also has activities in the media and business world in Macedonia, Minister <0xC3><0x87>ako, "all this is known in the public."
The Turks here are no longer giving their children to FET<0xC3><0x96> schools.
We call on our people to stop sending their children here any more.
"This structure, which has previously benefited from the hospitality and support of the public, is well known by the public," he said.
The sky will be a scene of meteor showers
TÜB<0xC4><0xB0>TAK National Observatory Researcher and Teaching Member of the Astronomy and Space Sciences Department of <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul University Professor Dr. Hasan Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu, in a statement to the AA reporter, commemorates Perseid’s speech on Friday, August 12th.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who stated that thousands of pieces of sunshine and the effect of the pull of the tail star called "Swift - tuttle" made up the Perseid skyscraper rain, said that this situation would turn into a rather natural visual hall.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu stated that the Perseid skystone was first discovered in 1862 and began to be seen again in the world since the 1990s.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who said that the Perseid skystone rain could be observed in July and August, said: "We need to be interested in watching such a visual spectacle from space."
After all, this is a natural visual show.
"It will help us to get to know the universe better," he said.
When it's cold, they'll swirl red, white light when it's warm
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu, noting that some of the pieces that broke the sky stone during the rain would fall to the earth in the size of a lens, continued as follows:
Perseid heat can reach up to 2,000 centigrades.
Due to the warming and friction in the atmosphere, the Persians produce light in red when they are cold in the natural environment, and when they are warm in white.
You can contribute to science by writing down how many skyscrapers were seen on the International Sky Organization’s website.
This data is valuable because it is collected from all over the world.
It can be watched all night.
Recalling that skyrocketing rain progressed at a rate of about 60 kilometers per second, Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu expressed that this visual hall in the sky could be monitored well from places with little light on the northeast side throughout the night.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who reports that there are more than 100 meteorites per year, recorded that after the Perseid meteorite rain on December 4-17, Geminid meteorite rain was a natural event worth observing.
Untrained, former footballer Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an
If this balance is broken, Fethullah Gülen, a widely religious entrepreneur led by the under-educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, has raised more than one thousand schools, colleges and colleges from Texas to Ta<0xC5><0x9F>kent.
The above is a translation of a sentence in an article published last week in Foreign Policy.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who is a university graduate, is a low-educated and former footballer; while Gülen, who is a primary school graduate, is widely regarded as an entrepreneur, these and similar articles are often featured in the Western press, where Gülen magazines are openly praised.
Then, on the other hand, they try to explain with the phrases beginning with “Why is American and/or Western opposition in Turkey?” in their articles.
It is possible to think that analysts who see the Western opposition in Turkey as a relative situation that emerged during Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s time are aware of Turkey’s history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first decade of the Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an period can be read as a period in which Western opposition in Turkey has declined or remained on average.
For the past decade, the European Union has been in good synchronized relations with the United States and the United States.
And he said to them, “Do not be afraid, for the Son of man is not come to destroy you, but to destroy you, and to destroy you, and to destroy you, and to destroy you, and to destroy you, and to destroy you, and to destroy you, and to destroy you.”
Let us, as a result of the bloody coup, lose 247 of our people, and let the so-called allies, the EU and the United States, until the failure of the coup has been proven to have no support for our democracy, and let us make Kerry’s first speech, in which we call it “the scapegoat of the eulogy of peace and stability” in Turkey.
Well, despite the killing of 11 Charlie Hebdo employees in Paris, many leaders from around the world, including Turkey, took part in the protest march, but the 247 people who resisted the tanks for democracy, despite the fact that the coup attempt was a month ago, no matter what the head of state, any "alliance" that comes to Turkey is any one of them.
What about the presidents who come a few times a year for the refugee issue, or those who send high-level representatives, send lower-level representatives?
How will we assess whether all EU and U.S. ambassadors are visiting the past because the glass of the newspaper Hürriyet has been broken, and whether the bombing of Turkey is on a solidarity visit to the Grand National Assembly?
When the coup in Egypt occurred in the first two weeks, when the EU sent a senior representative to Sisi, Kerry’s visit after the coup is reconstructed from the “democracy” and the “democracy” is rebuilt from the “democracy” to the “democracy” to the “democracy” and the “democracy” to the “democracy” to the “democracy”.
However, even allowing Gülen to live freely in the U.S., which 95 percent of the population sees as responsible for the coup, is now enough to oust the Turkish people.
If the background I have mentioned above is added to this, I think it is clear that the rising anti-Western/American opposition is a situation that can only be explained by Erdogan.
Moreover, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an did not even say that he thought that the US had an effect on the coup...
So the coffin was never intrusive.
Will the Travel Wizards, who humiliate voters who see their own people as little, saying, "We are a scoundrel," who don't think they are, like, "wizards who smear their bodies," be able to steal from the same wire after the night of July 15th?
After seeing how this people came to have state and democracy, did they look for an answer to the question, “Where have we gone wrong?”
But are there so many questions that need to be answered?
The officers, who served in various stages until yesterday and were given the right to use the weapons of the state, immediately agreed to enter the status of "Treason" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what kind of mental distortion we live in, and how obsession with people leads people to behaviors that will be described as distortion.
When the irrigated brains are on strike...
Was there a point of view for those who participated in this action beyond resembling the cities of Turkey to the cities of Syria?
Why does an officer bomb the parliament of his own country?
We probably shouldn't have fallen into a misconception like waiting for reasonable behaviors from the brains watered down by FETO's bedbugs.
But let's just say that it's not all FAT.
Personnel presenting politics as a profession of struggle, grief and hate have also made necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced.
Even those who present themselves as “the Light” have convinced the masses that all sorts of illegal behavior and even indecency are natural.
When guns were handed over to those who hated their own people, we finally saw how they opened fire on this people.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I say one very simple thing: on the evening of July 15th, he gave 250 martyrs to the FET<0xC3><0x96> thugs, smugglers, exhibitions in the Turkish army and much more than to save democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
There are three changes prepared in these three periods: economic, social, political.
Social change has prepared two major events: the migration from rural to metropolis and the relocation of these migrations to the center after being held around cities for a very long time.
On Wednesday, I announced that this move was by subway.
I also emphasized that whether you pass the metro or not is the most important component of social change.
The second major change in the same direction are bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and bridge to modernization is easier to understand.
The road is coming, the economic and social structure is changing.
It has changed the political structure so much.
I've been spotting this history with bridges over the throat in Istanbul since I was a long time ago.
Demirel built the Throat Bridge.
This was the culmination of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
The <0xC3><0x96>zal continued to advance in the same direction with the second bridge that we have now changed its name to the 15th of July City Bridge.
Even their road routes indicate the relationship established between the environment and the center.
It is also a sign of what kind of social change path is being followed.
The goal of Demirel and <0xC3><0x96>zal was to melt the large masses at the center.
The center's ideology was to be adopted by them.
The AK Party did not make the third bridge for many years.
Because the migration was moving at full speed.
The people who arrived were stationed in satellite cities.
A somewhat closed system was created in those areas.
The local governments of the AK Party gave people the upper hand, work, social status, and they also voted for the AK Party.
Thus, the masses were asked not to melt in the center, but to acquire their political consciousness in the surroundings and then come to the center as ‘their own’.
This was related to the ongoing headline debates before the AK Party (1992-2002).
These debates admitted to the masses the need to stand side-by-side, not the integration of conservative, conservative, and rural people with the center.
The AK Party politicized, joined politics, and matured the masses by acting in the manner I stated after 2002.
After that, be careful now, the democratic struggle on July 15 coincides with the construction of the 3rd Bridge.
So, history and sociology have been covered.
Let me add another dimension to this: the movement of the AK Party I am talking about is not limited only to the Istanbul bridges.
Something more interesting is happening: the AK Party is now integrating the surrounding cities with the central cities.
This is done through two bridges.
One, Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the 1915 Canakkale Bridge.
Add ways to it.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrakia on another route.
You know what that means, Izmir will be a different city from now on.
Let’s say that the AK Party will no longer take Izmir from ‘outside’.
Now Bursa, now <0xC3><0x87>anakkale, now Thracian cities will turn into other five and social geographies.
That's it!
The martyrs of July 15 are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and fun sports in Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e
Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e continued the preparations of the Grasshoppers match by training in the morning.
The training, which began at 10 a.m. at the Can Bartu Facilities under the direction of technical director Vitor Pereira, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core training in the hall, players who went out into the field did 2 rounds of catching and rusting with their running and warming movements.
The training was completed with a pair of castle matches in the narrow area.
Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e will continue his training in the evening hours.
That person who complained about the Holy Lightning to Gülen...
New developments are underway regarding Operation Shike for Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e.
Huseyin Gülerce, a journalist who participated in a program published in CNN Turk and explained that the operation was carried out by FET<0xC3><0x96>, "a name from the world of sports has raised the words of St. Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m to Fethullah Gülen himself."
“One day, I’m on a plane with this person saying, ‘What are you doing next to Fethullah Gülen?’
When this person conveyed these words to Gülen, Fethullah Gülen also put it on the Holy Lightning.
Why did he put it on the Holy Lightning?
If the president of the club, which is the most supportive of Turkey, is in this mindset, he could harm himself with his thought.
"The <0xC5><0x9E>ike case was to disprove the Holy Lightning," he said.
After these words, a statement came from Faik Light, one of the key lawyers in the Shike Case.
I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k appeared on the Opposite Vision program published in Habertürk and announced the person complaining to FET<0xC3><0x96> chief Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of Faik Light:
The Holy Lightning tells <0xC4><0xB0>hsan Kalkavan something about Fethullah Gülen.
Coming from Azerbaijan, on a private plane.
The Holy Father is a funny man, and when he criticizes someone, he also speaks in subversive sentences.
Those submerged sentences may be a little wing.
Some may react to those sentences.
These sentences are being raised somewhere.
The towels, the skies, that so many businessmen go there as if they were going to Haqqa, Umra, it's not a matter of such tolerance.
What they say is very critical of what they say.
Of course, that's not the only problem.
There are also attempts by a football team.
The direct links of some footballers and managers from the Galatasaray Club and Hakan <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>kr<0xC4><0xB1>r...
Muharrem Usta: Shike is different
Trabzonspor President Muharrem Usta extended his hand of friendship to Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e.
Master, who says that the issue of Turkey is the issue of all clubs, "We are on the side of this country with 79 million."
We have to take a firm stand.
If Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e has a problem with FET<0xC3><0x96>, if injustice has been committed, I stand behind Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e.
"But the difference between Trabzonspor and Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e is different," he said.
Sacrifice prices are announced.
Karabulut said: "We have determined the price of a kilogram of live victim meat as a unit of 18 lira."
"We have determined the price of live cows at <0xC2><0xA3>17, and the price of live cows at <0xC2><0xA3>15," he said.
Karabulut, who noted that animals that would not be sacrificed last year were also sold, said that citizens should pay attention when making sacrifices:
Especially in animals, attention should be paid to the earrings.
It is also important that the animal is healthy.
For this, our citizens can check the vaccines on the animal's passport while they're sacrificing.
In terms of appearance, the victim must be alive and alive, and have shed their hair on it.
You don't have to have symptoms like saliva or bone on your face.
In recent years, we have seen animals that have not been sacrificed for sale and sold.
An animal that is a victim must be 2 years old.
We can understand this by looking at the animal's teeth.
We've got teeth that we labeled as the 'cap' of an animal that's 2 years old.
However, the younger animals did not have these teeth.
The animal may be large in appearance, but the lid teeth may not have come out.
Cover teeth are also noticeable immediately because they are already large compared to others.
Rize Airport to be taken to sea
The second airport to be built in Turkey will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on a seafill 26 to 32 meters away from the coast on 266 hectares between Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilköy Village and Girl Tower site in Pazar district.

Awesome quotes from Robert Amsterdam about FET<0xC3><0x96>!
Robert Amsterdam, the official of the law firm Amsterdam&Partners, which is investigating the international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FET<0xC3><0x96>), shared information about how FET<0xC3><0x96> is organized by penning an article to the US magazine Forbes.
FETO chief Fetullah Gülen, who manages the organization from his mansion in Pennsylvania, Amsterdam, reveals that the organization's "developed degree in undercover discovery of Gülen's "about 150 charter schools in the U.S."
Amsterdam, which was commissioned by Turkey seven months ago to investigate affiliated companies and schools, said it was “shocking” what they found so far.
Amsterdam, in its article, expressed the following views:
According to the information given to us by the publishers, the Laughing Organization has a strict hierarchy in which instructions are transmitted.
These instructions are usually given at face-to-face meetings in Gülen and Poconos.
On the top of the hill there is a management group of seven people.
These instructions are forwarded to the advisory committee.
The instructions go from here respectively to the Imams of the region, the Imams of the country, the Imams of the region within the country, the Imams of the year, the Imams of the region within the years, the Imams of the neighborhood, the Imams of their student houses (houses of light), and the students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels depending on their positions within the organization and their support.
Reporting that the organization has opened 55,000 jobs worldwide, Amsterdam has the largest network of contracted schools in the U.S., reported that millions of dollars of taxes paid by U.S. officials are given to these schools each year.
Amsterdam wrote that the bulk of this money was directed by members of the organization among themselves and transferred to "selected" transferring companies.
Amsterdam explained this process with the following examples:
Founded in California, Magnolia schools were caught giving $700,000 in annual service contracts to the company, which is linked to Gülen and shares the same office.
Amsterdam also showcased the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam also noted that the school paid an additional $3.1 million to the owner, as well as that in the audits, the school and the owner’s management were found to be made up of the same people associated with Gülen.
Noting that there are similar situations in the 46 Harmony schools, which hold the largest place in the laughter network, Amsterdam said that the software license paid to smaller companies linked to FET<0xC3><0x96> with pencils such as the receipt of the curriculum.
Amsterdam, drawing on what was done within FET<0xC3><0x96>, enriching each other, "These examples I have given show that American taxpayers are misused about $28 million."
"And that's the visible part of what we've found so far," he said.
Amsterdam, which has so far indicated that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents, recalled that the situation has worsened over the past few years, all of which are being investigated by the Texas Department of Education.
Amsterdam emphasized that schools are apparently functioning normally, and that many employees do not have any information about what kind of corruption is.
Amsterdam, "But actually these schools work like snow machines for Laughing."
"Gülen then uses huge amounts of money for political donations to cover up his illegal activities," he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked at these schools, Amsterdam, which reported that some employees at Gülen schools held separate meetings, transferring a certain portion of their salaries to the organization, was also working in a similar operation by Gülen members of the Turkish Armed Forces.
The provocative strikers were strengthening their positions over the years.
"But apparently, the army was operating normally while a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes," he wrote.
Amsterdam concluded its article as follows:
There are question marks on the heads of U.S. policy makers about the events of July 15-16 and beyond, and that’s what’s expected.
However, while addressing the two allies’ situations at the diplomatic level, those in state authorities individually need to wake up to the serious violation of U.S. law in Gülen’s operations.

The driver took the injured children to the emergency health station in the village of Narince, putting them in the trunk of the car so as not to ‘pollute the seats’.
Two wounded children were transported from here by ambulance to the Two State Hospital.
From the wounded, Huseyin O. provides the struggle of life in intensive care.
He carried the children he hit in his luggage so that their seats would not get dirty.
Mustafa O. recounting the accident, "We were going to visit with friends."
We got our stuff.
We were hit by a car near the transfo of the Prophet's visit to Karadut village, Uzeyir.
As a result of the collision, my leg was broken.
The driver first picked up my friend and threw him in the luggage.
And then he took me and put me in the trunk of the car next to my friend.
When I put my hand in the trunk, my hand was in the trunk door.
I yelled, too.
The driver, who hears my voice, throws the luggage door open again.
I fixed my hand, too.
Your luggage door closed again and took us to the village of Narince.
“From there, we were taken to Two State Hospital by ambulance,” he said.
When the parents of the injured children first found out that the driver was not complaining, they were complaining that they were bringing the children in the trunk.
Mustafa O., the grandfather of the injured child, "I was in Kahta when the accident occurred."
I learned on the phone that my grandson and my niece had an accident.
I immediately went to two state hospitals.
They brought my niece first.
Fifteen minutes later, they brought my granddaughter.
Commander Gerger's here.
He said you were a complainer.
And I'm in an accident everywhere.
I said I'm not complaining.
Then I went and looked at the car that hit my niece and grandson.
There's a lot of blood in the trunk.
Then we found out that after he hit the kids, he put both of the injured in the trunk of the car and took them to the hospital.
My niece is also putting my grandson in the trunk.
People say I didn't put it in my luggage.
But the back seats of the car are clean.
He said, "That can't happen."
Mehmet Kaya, a resident of Narince Village, said: "The driver who hit the children, brought the injured here."
The children, the injured, were taken out of the trunk of the car.
"He did what he didn't do to the animal," he said.
His uncle, Osman O., said, “What kind of man is the citizen who shot these children?”
It could be an accident, or a person could die in an accident.
But arresting the injured and taking the car to the hospital is a wild thing.
We're followers until the end of this.
One of these kids is starving to death.
The other's condition is heavy.
From Narince to Kahta, he's bringing the injured in the trunk of the car.
God damn it.
It's not going to be such a wild thing again.
Our lungs are burning.
We're gonna be the plaintiff, and we're not gonna let this go.
"We want the person to be severely punished," he said.
He built himself an island.
The famous architect Richart Sowa spent the last eight years of his life building an ecological paradise.
In this self-sufficient living space he built using 150,000 plastic bottles, he lives with his former model, Jodi Bowlin, whom he met on Facebook two years ago.
Richart's island was made up of air-filled plastic bottles, wooden pallets, and sand.
The two-storey house has 2 bathrooms, a jacuzzi, 3 showers, a kitchen and wireless internet connection.
Around the island there are palm trees, mangroves, fruit trees, other renewable plants, herbs.
The island, which is connected to the coast by a 30-meter cordon, produces its own electricity, water, and internet with the help of this cordon.
Sowa said, "I'm a vegetarian and I grow a lot of edible vegetables on the island."
I have to go to the little grocery stores nearby to get to other food.
“I’ve made plastic bottles again, and I’ve got an eight-person release,” he said.

Thanks for the help, I couldn't find it.
The police took action after Selmet <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>r was notified of a Friday prayer at the Salko Mosque in Adapazar<0xC4><0xB1> Sakarya Street.
Teams who went to the mosque waited for Friday prayers to be made.

Firari's chief security officer was arrested in Zaho
Ahmet Duran Bitmez, 3rd Class Security Director at the Batman Provincial Security Directorate, was revealed in the investigation into FET<0xC3><0x96>’s attempted coup.
It was also determined that Bitmez, who was arrested for his arrest, fled.
A study by the Provincial Security Directorate found that Bitmez fled to the Iraqi city of Zaho.
He was caught in a joint operation carried out by the security forces of the two countries.
Bitmez, who was brought to Turkey, was arrested in Batman.
He was immediately sent to the lawyer after his security operations.
Security forces suspect that Bitmez's terrorist organization has fled Iraq to the north to join PKK camps.
Pay attention to the children’s habits.
Dr. Bligin Giray, a professor at the Faculty of Dentistry, said that children were able to relax with this reflex by making it a requirement to absorb because they were unable to chew at an early age.
Dr. Giray, who ranks the causes of the appearance of the habit of finger sucking in children, said, "Painting sucking is an event seen from birth to 3-4 years of age."
Most babies suck their thumbs.
A child who sucks his finger to satisfy the need for sucking in infancy after 1-1,5 years sucks his finger to relieve the desire for a mother's breast and to relax.
"You can get bored and you wake yourself up, when you fall asleep, when you're upset and when you leave your mother," he said.
Do<0xC3><0xA7> emphasising that the insufficiency in the parent-child relationship and the lack of confidence in the child lie on the basis of finger sucking behavior seen in the elderly. Dr. Bilgin Giray explains the effects of this behavior on dental health with the following words:
Finger sucking behavior has a negative effect on the formation of the dental structure of the child.
As a result of the pressures that occur during absorption, the upper teeth are pushed forward, and the lower teeth are pushed back.
This also leads to the positioning of the lower jaw behind, disrupting the balance of the gum and dental structure.
The physiological reflection of this is in the form of speech disorder and the aesthetic appearance of closure.
Dr. Giray, noting that at the age of 6-7, in which permanent teeth begin to come out without an early solution, a much more complex treatment process can be experienced. "We can protect our children from problems of closure and joints before the development of the mouth is complete."
“That’s why today children’s mouth structures, such as eye and hearing controls, need to be kept under control,” he added.
New breath in near-sightedness treatment: Trifocal Lenses
Patients after cataract treatment do not naturally want to wear glasses.
Multi-focus lenses have been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
With trifocal lenses that began to be used in recent times, the success of treatment in this area has taken a step further.
The difference between trifocal lenses and other lenses is that they can provide clear vision not only at distances or near distances, but also at distances defined as distances between them.
Treatment of distant, near or intermittent vision disorders
Intermediate distance in visual disturbances represents a point we use so often in our daily lives.
For example, the car’s display panel is the distances between the portable computers we hold in our arms, or the distances we define as the arm length of 60-70 cm.
Thanks to the correction of distances between trifocal lenses, our patients do not need to wear glasses in any way, near or far.
Another advantage of trifocal lenses is that it also reduces nighttime complaints.
Dr. Volkan Hürmeric "There is no difference from normal cataract treatment of trifocal lens treatment applied for every distance vision treatment."
The patients we treat with trifocal treatment are comfortable in their eye health with a 7 to 10 minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It is an operation that improves the quality of life especially for people who drive a car, who use computers too much, love to read and live a more active life.
You can also contact your eye disease specialist to find out if this procedure can be applied to any patient who is 18 years of age or older.
Varicose veins are not used in heart surgery!
Varicose veins have become a very common disease in recent years.
While genetic closeness is a priority, long hours of work, jobs that require long-term standing and long-term sitting lead to increased varicose vein complaints.
Are varicose veins used for heart surgery?
There is a variation, what to do if I have a heart attack in them? questions are often asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of ball bearing systems on the leg:
1.There is a deep artery system in the leg that carries dirty blood to the lungs and collects the main dirty blood in the leg.
These are called the deep femoral vein and the superficial femoral vein.
Problems in these arteries are more rare, their diseases can not close the veins, and drug treatments are used to keep these vessels open.
There is a superficial ball bearing system in the leg that takes dirty blood to the lungs and connects it to the deep artery system.
This system consists of two large and two small, so-called safe veins.
Insufficiency and inheritance can develop in all four of these vessels.
The bullets that can be used in heart surgery are the superficial bullets called large safe veins.
The absence of these vessels does not cause any harm in the body and can therefore be used for heart surgery.
But in order for these vessels to be used in heart surgery, the vessels need to be healthy.
Because the heart is an important organ.
The process of incinerating varicose veins with surgery or leaving them in place with a laser also reduces the workload of deep arteries and makes the leg healthier.
A misconception among the public is that even if it is inherited, the veins can be used as a backup.
Varicose veins are never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other veins that can be used in heart surgery.
Replacement vascular systems that can be used for heart surgery are located under the chest cage, around the stomach, and in the arm.
Therefore, it is useless to wait and worry about using the varicose veins for the heart.

Meaningful message from Uzbekistan before the Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun <0xC3><0x96>zbek released a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final to be played between Galatasaray and Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>.

This match is neither the first nor the last match in the competition that left our club a century behind.
But it's a very vital meeting in terms of timing.
As we all know, our country passed through a great storm on the night of July 15.
The coup attempt of the Fetullah<0xC3><0xAD> Terror Organization/Parallel State Building (FET<0xC3><0x96>/PDY), which refers to our democracy, was overcome thanks to the unity and coherence of all sections of society.
That night We paid heavy burdens as a people.
We gave the towns.
We have a lot of gas.
This painful price once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of the rule of peace, not of fighting in these lands.
That night the representatives of the Turkish sport opposed the coup with one voice, with one heart; they were all in favour of democracy.
In these critical days, we need the unifying feature of sport more than ever.
On the 2nd anniversary of the death of our dear rival, Süleyman Seba, and on the occasion of the new football season, named after our club’s legendary captain Turgay <0xC5><0x9E>eren, this match will be the starting match of love and peace in Turkish sport.
At the end of the match, which Galatasaray and Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> fans will split in half, I guarantee that the winner will be our country and Turkish sport.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home as Britain wins gold
While defending their 2012 London title, Scottish Callum Skinner ran for the men's race on the Rio racetrack last night.
Glasgow has taken on the pioneering role of the 23-year-old racer, Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and this young man proudly returns home victoriously with his award-winning New Zealand outfit.
In the event four years ago that Hoy took five out of six Olympic gold medals, Britain had a shock victory.
And despite Hoy's retirement, they repeated it by finishing sixth at the World Championships in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the expert starter Jamie Staff.
This is exactly what the Indians did when they arrived.
Today's retirement also created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had already seen the potential that Scot had already realized, and the British coach had not given up on Skinner.
Four years ago, Indians, Kenny, and Skinner, who were champions with Hoy, broke the Olympic record on the ranking tour, but New Zealand re-established that record on the first round.
And the British trio went on a duel for gold.
Although the Indians were a little behind on their tour, Kenny brought the team forward, and Skinner relied on that.
Much of the transformation that made the Indians use a larger vehicle to slow themselves down, allowing Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep pace, was this change in strategy.
Today, as an expert BBC commentator, he watched them from the scene and when they went out on the podium, Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes were caught in the eye.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: “This is an honorable comparison.”
I'm just here to do my best and announce my name.
In the final, we broke the Olympic record and defeated the world champions.
That was really incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
The Indians admitted to having intentionally fallen onto the track after winning with Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012.
He then reacted to this interpretation and there was no way to demand from Britain's rivals.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
The Hindus said: “We were like in London, with all the flags of Great Britain in the state.”
We're a team that was founded just three months ago.
“We lost a lot of world races so it’s really incredible to have won the Olympics again.
This is just an event, a medal, for a nation that wins seven out of 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of the progress we have made in the last five months, we have five more days to successfully pass on the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of repeating three gold winning records in a single Olympics isn't nearly impossible.
This will mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, and who was also born on March 23 (also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister, a British sporting past sacred date), will reach six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same level as today.
Kenny will go sprint from now on; the race will start today and last three days.
28-year-old Boltonlu said: “I’m just enjoying it right now.
Team events are always the best events.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when one wins alone, one feels alone.
The Hindus said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be given the title of knight.”
This is only the event of today’s medal, but there is a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-kilometre team race.
They finished the runway in 3:51,943.
The 2012 London Gold Medal winner set a world record of 3:51,659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be set in today's second episode and will definitely attract all of Wiggins' attention.
Prior to yesterday's ranking round, officials had a disagreement with officials when they called him in to measure his size.
At the women’s event that will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald reached the world record for 4:13.260.
The British team relies on a strong cycling team to handle the riders in the middle of the Olympic Games and win many medals.
After great advantage was shown in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio were greatly reduced.
In the background, there have been many bad developments, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the retirement of important names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the races on the track shows that Britain’s reputation for finishing in perfect time will be re-proven this time around.
With the cancellation of the energy contract, the future of the Portland iceberg is questionable
The future of the Portland-Victoria aluminum smelter and the work of hundreds of workers is uncertain after one of the plant owners has announced the termination of a supply contract in a way that will lead to the cancellation of all of the energy supply contracts of the power company that supplies the plant.
This move came after the Victorian government made a decision earlier this year to avoid subventions to keep the facility running.
The 20-year period of permanent subsistence ends in November.
Alcoa's Portland facility could be at work risk by 2000.
Any closure process can cause up to 2,000 businesses to be directly or indirectly at risk.
And additional chaining effects may also occur because Victoria's ignition furnace consumes about 10 percent of all electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down the coal mine, which led to the shutdown of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland facility is losing money and facing the risk of closure.
These developments have emerged after speculations for the plant's future over several years, initially with the strengthening of the Australian dollar and recently based on the plant's consumption fee.
Loy Yang A, who supplies energy from the power plant to the large aluminum smelter in Latrobe Valley, said AGL expects the other three owners to act to terminate their contracts.
The vast majority of the facility is owned by Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture and China's CITIC, Japan's Marubeni Corp. owns smaller shares.
"AGL is waiting for the Portland facility to continue to operate, which means that the ignition furnace will continue to require physical electricity," he said.
AGL said the contracts were "risk balancing agreements" that had to come into force from November 2016.
As the contracts are a 12-month term, they will be completed in 2017.
The energy company said, “Therefore, AGL will continue to expect the contracts to contribute to the 2017 financial year as well.”
The effects that AGL may be exposed to for the 2018 fiscal year and subsequent potential gains are currently limited by the adoption of a strong long-term contract stance for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the value of its contracts in its accounts had already fallen to $187 million because of the "expectation expectation".
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the ignition furnace or provide electricity to the ignition furnace."
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010; the contract was due to come into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it has not withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts protested against the possibility of closure of both the Portland coal mine in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to economic troubles in the sector.
Earlier this week, Stephen Mikkels, head of operations at AGL, who responded to analysts, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy.
In the event that both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, demand in the [electricity] market will fall in the value-added ratio.
And as a manufacturer, this will not be a good development for us.”
Not just the star of Kardashian TV show; Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue
Model and managing mother Kris' fourth daughter, Kendall Jenner, of Kardashian-Jenner, is on the cover of the highly anticipated September issue of U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has appeared in fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Instagram on Thursday.
Kendall wrote: “I cried when I looked at this lid in a room full of people I loved.
Following the release of the cover, the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (who has a problem with the bar, Rob and Caitlyn, and their uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest, from everyone's favorite show world) is featured in the trailer (or just a cover of the video: a sequel to the latest installment of Keeping Up with the Kardashians), a screenplay.
While this is the cliché storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of all children's television shows (Seacrest says with the intimacy of a cartoon rabbit at 8am, "Did you think we forgot you?"), Kris also included other girls in this introduction in a way.
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, we are certainly entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's sister Kim may have passed him on to the Vogue cover (the cover shared with his wife Kanye West in April 2014) but the magazine's September cover was a headlining success.
Vogue’s September number was the highest selling number of the year.
With its thickness reminiscent of a coffee table book from a fashion magazine, this number attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that last year's 832-page volume contained advertising content in 615).
The announcement of the cover star is also a closely watched process; for the past two years, images of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were previously featured in the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has given place to celebrities who are very "modeling" than "glorious models".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and the following year it was awarded to Lady Gaga.
But even in the case of Ms. Jenner being described by the magazine as the "sparkling model" of the generation, it can be said that the environment is quite good.
These celebrities, celebrities’ relatives or reality show stars or not the young people of today who know how to shoot good Snapchat videos (although Jenner is all of this).
All of these are women who are legitimate, prominent in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover, Beyonce spent one of the best times of her career with Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of the reality show’s history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour, Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid called them "the whistles of time."
When news surfaced that Jenner would be on Vogue's cover, that thought came to the surface again.
But it seems pointless to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He’s literally a supermodel.
He's going on Marc Jacobs' shows.
Estee Lauder takes you from the fund.
She sells her own paintings in the payment wall apps that relate to you, along with her sisters.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe just to see her brother Kourtney and her kids on reality TV.
Social Legal Support Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
While the sector is preparing for the impact of more funding cuts in the already strained operations, more than 160,000 of the nation’s most unprotected cuts are turning away from social legal support centres.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly seniors, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, and those with no resources to fight unfair evacuation decisions, and the like) turn back for free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their potential, are preparing for further disruption.
As of June next year, more than 30 percent of these legal support centers are planned to be deprived of federal funding.
According to James Farrel, Director of the Queensland Centers for Social Legal Support, the National Association of Social Legal Support Centers’ latest census report found that thousands of people are being turned back every year.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would get much worse if the federal government's decision was not withdrawn.
“Queensland’s societal legal support centers are receiving chronically insufficient financial support, which means that thousands of people are unable to access the vital services they need,” he said.
People who are in violent relationships, who are struggling with the power of the administration and the forces that break their backs, families in the process of separation, and workers who are unfairly dismissed... all of these face problems with legal dimensions, and according to this report, they are reaching out to the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents will be forced to cope with more complex legal problems without receiving help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately recover these funding cuts so that people can get the support they need when faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to bring legal support funding to the national average level.
We should now look at the investment that the Palaszczuk government will make in this important work in the social legal support centers and the communities where they serve.
Donald Trump’s campaign team has been sued after personnel claimed to have fired guns
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign team has been sued on charges that the director of operations in North Carolina was not taking any action after a staff member was told to fire while traveling with a chip in February.
The case was announced Wednesday in a case filed by former software trainer Vincent Bordini on the state campaign team in a state court.
Bordini said he expected him to take care of the situation from within for months but later realized that "it won't happen."
According to Bordini’s complaint, the Director, Earl Philip “raised a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and held the dagger toward Vincent’s kneecap.”
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four more people had the same experience as Phillip after complaining to the local and regional campaign team leaders.
In his complaint, Bordini said, “The guns don’t need to be fired to cause damage.”
The lawsuit tells the crowd in North Carolina what "the Second Amendment people" (as gun owners and gun proponents of) might do after Hillary Clinton's election and the election of her own judges could take two days after the Republican nominee's election.
Trump’s campaign team said the media valued these words outside the context and did not support the violence itself.
Bordini, with his complaint, seeks compensation from the campaign team for oversight negligence and Phillip for the attack, scarcity and spiritual damage.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not quickly turn the message that asked for comment.
His efforts to reach Phillip were inconclusive.
The WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to Innovative Consulting Services, his consulting firm, did not return quickly.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

Report the "FET<0xC3><0x96>" line
Following President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s call for FET<0xC3><0x96>’s “everything can’t know intelligence, everyone can’t know security, report,” the Ministry of Interior and Security set up the FET<0xC3><0x96>’s reporting line.
Following the July 15 coup attempt, new applications are being launched for the detection of "secret congregationers" who hide themselves while thousands of FET<0xC3><0x96> are being expelled from institutions.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an underlined the importance of the announcements that citizens will make in the fight against FET<0xC3><0x96>: "Your friends from that society may be your friends, I say that you reveal them."
You need to report it to the prosecutors.
This is a patriotic debt.
“Not everyone may know intelligence, security, or maybe not grow up, but people are running away,” he said.
Within the scope of the studies, an online notification application was launched by the Ministry of the Interior, the Directorate-General for Security and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT).
According to this, those who serve FET<0xC3><0x96> around the citizen will be able to communicate their activities of the organization, the institutions belonging to the organization, thanks to this application to the security and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
www.egm.gov.tr/pages/news, www.mit.gov.tr/yours will keep the information of the persons who will inform the service through the form provided to the service through the links.
Those who wish to apply the notification provided by the Directorate-General for Security will also be able to add the document.
Again, in the same application, the whistleblower will be returned to him if he so desires.
The citizen will also be able to inform the Public Prosecutor's Offices of the Republic of the year and counties in which they can report to the "155 Police Imdat" line by telephone.
Inspired by Bodrum, they made 'exemplary village' in Sivas
Canköy, Kaykakaml<0xC4><0xB1> and philanthropic businessman in the Lake District of S<0xC4><0xB0>VAS was made an 'example village' in cooperation.
In the village, which paved the roads and laid the stairs with parking stone, all the houses were painted in blue and white, taking the example of the Bodrum district of Mu<0xC4><0x9F>la.
Gölova Skakamm<0xC4><0x97> has prepared an exemplary village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages connected to the district.
Within this scope, the sample village was selected as a 66-person Canköy, 12 km from the county center.
The roads of the village were paved with asphalt, while the elevators were covered with parking stone.
Village houses with different shades of color were painted with the support of businessman Salahattin Ayan, owner of Pelit Pastaneri.
The whole village was covered in the image of buildings painted in white and blue.
BEDROOM EARNED
Erkan <0xC4><0xB0>sa Erat, who gave information about the work, said that they had prepared this project to sign a study that would create a role model for other villages: "The appearance of the sky more modern was part of our project that all houses were one color."
When we started this project, we were looking for a place to take an example.
When we went to the basement, the white-painted and blue-windowed view of the houses caught our attention.
We also wanted to take Bodrum as an example because of the cleanliness of white and its positive impact on people.
By doing our work, we painted all the houses in Canköy in white and blue.
This work was carried out in cooperation with the state and charities.
The project cost about 200,000 lira.
By working, our Village in Sivas was like a little Bodrum.
We want to continue to budget this kind of work and again with the support of our business people.
The 66-year-old Abdullah Macit, Manköy Muhtar<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0x81>r<0xC4><0xAB>, said the village has gained a whole new image with the support of the Skakakamti.

The disputed asset fund is re-introduced to the commission
Turkey’s Asset Fund, which is expected to enter among the world’s largest funds, has been removed from the law on objections.
It was decided that the fund would be reconsidered due to the lack of a supervisory mechanism, but it was reconsidered in the commission without any changes.
Utku <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>rözer, CHP Member of Parliament and Member of the Plan and Budget Commission, assessing the proposal of the Turkish Asset Fund brought by the AKP to sozcu.com.tr, states that "the amount of the assets to be taken from the public is the amount of the worker's employment, the amount of the funds to be taken from the employees, the amount of the pension, the amount of the work without which is to be paid.
The proposal of the Turkish Asset Fund, prepared by the government for the purpose of providing long-term resources to investments and projects, was removed from the bag on Tuesday with the view that the opposition should also be considered.
However, the AKP today brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission in the same way.
The CHP member of the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission, Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehir MP Utku <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>rözer, told sozcu.com.tr about CHP’s concerns and concerns about the proposal of the Asset Fund.
<0xD0><0xA7><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBA><0xD1><0x80><0xD1><0x83><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80>, "When the establishment of this fund comes to the Plan and Budget Commission in the draft of the bag law, our former Finance Minister, Zakeriya Temizel, who is at the head of the CHP council, expressing our concerns and concerns, the fact that the bag has been removed from the law and also discussed in detail."
The government, which accepted this view, also withdrew the bill.
The bill came back to the commission yesterday as well.
"The government seems to be insistent on removing it from the House within a week," he said.
<0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>rözer states that there should be a consensus on the coming out of the Wealth Fund Act, "Our biggest concern in this bill's proposal is irregularity."
"Assets belonging to the public, the worker, the compulsory pension breaks to be taken from the employees, the incomes to be collected from the unemployment fund for the unemployed, the income to be obtained without personalization, outside the control of the Assembly and the Council, and without any liability."
Chakurözer, who states that Russia, China and the Gulf countries have oil revenues and trade surpluses, where such funds are established, and that the fund is financed in this way, "But we have a savings deficit."
So the fund will be made up of public resources, i.e. public money.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund, 100 billion from the individual pension fund, which was forcibly converted into employees, is planned to transfer 50 billion without personalization.
“That means that this fund, which will be made entirely with the public’s money, must be under public control and should not be spent irresponsibly,” he said.
Emphasizing that the collection of state resources, the indebtedness of a fund of state-owned assets to be held outside the control of the Assembly, <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>rözer described his concerns and concerns regarding the proposal of the Asset Fund Act as follows:
The accumulation, the expenditure, the business and the transactions relating to the public debt of such a large public asset cannot be overridden only by the supervision of independent audit firms.
There must also be public scrutiny and a transparent structure.
In the bill, there are no provisions on the audit and transparency of the Asset Fund in constitutional institutions.
There's no limit on how much resources will be transferred.
No one will ask about how this fund is being used.
The purpose of the fund is to justify the financing of large projects.
There is no need to set up an unsupervised fund outside the budget for this.
Why don't you put it on the budget?
When this is the case, naturally the question arises to the minds, “Why is it avoiding the control of the Council and the Assembly?”
<0xD0><0xA7>a<0xD0><0xBA><0xD1><0x80><0xD1><0x83><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x80>, stating that they are not against the transfer of money to investments while accumulating in the Asset Fund, but that they are against the fact that this is done by intransparent, non-accounting mechanisms: "Is such a fund needed to be debated?"
But if the Government insists on this, then we must ensure that the international standards applicable in other countries where such investment funds are established are also valid in Turkey.
It must be structured in such a way as to bring about the mechanism of control and accountability.
It must be set up in a way that will give the account of the money used to the citizen until the last penny.
<0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>röözer, who strongly opposes the proposal of the Asset Fund to the commission, said: “We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms in the Assembly, especially after the July 15 coup attempt.”
We hope that in this bill, the AKP will listen to our constructive criticisms.
We oppose the illegal use, transfer of national assets, the irresponsibility of those who use them, and the lack of public scrutiny.
“Only if these concerns are removed can the desired Asset Fund be useful,” he said.
On the bill, it was learned that work was being done to ensure reconciliation between the AKP and the opposition.
“The confidence we have in Turkey is a sign of the investment we are making.”
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ford Automotive Chairman Ali Ko<0xC3><0xA7> said: “The investment of TL 30 billion we have made in the last 5 years is an indication of the confidence we have in the future of our country.”
Ko<0xC3><0xA7> Holding’s Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Automotive, Ali Ko<0xC3><0xA7>, the director of a large number of foreign capital firms, held a meeting on the topic of “Trusted in Turkey, Producers in Turkey” organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Ali Ko<0xC3><0xA7> said: "Our faith and trust in our country, along with our middlemen, do not only convey the so-called expression, but we fill it with our investments and actions."
The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is an indicator of the confidence we have heard in the future of our country.
It is not about attracting more foreign investment to Turkey; a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy of international standards, a qualified workforce and R&D, an ecosystem that promotes innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
In the last few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives in the history of the Republic.
“I believe he used the phrase ‘We can launch a new Investment Pool’ that we need with these incentives and holistic strategies.
Siemens Industry and Commerce Turkey Chairman and CEO Huseyin Gelis said: “We know that no more events are not just a country’s problem, but as global players.”
We have come to Turkey with a long-term view.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
We were able to bring to this land that was not in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we will set up factories, but we should have a clear horizon in this area," he said.
Recalling that Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for themselves, Shell Turkey President Ahmet Erdem, "Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell."
We strongly believe in the potential and future of Turkey.
In the beginning, we have invested in many areas, including energy, and we continue to do so.
We would like to thank our President, our Prime Minister and our Ministers for their supportive work for international investors.
Works are being done that give confidence to international investors.
"This is also in the direction of increasing the competitiveness of our country," he said.
Dr. Altan Demirdere, President of Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and Middle East Region, said: “On August 10, our Global CEO was coming to Turkey.”
But the trip was postponed.
We opposed it, too.
The arrival of the CEO was very important.
They were asked for bulletproof cars, like protection.
Then when he came here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left his guard and the car and happily returned to his homeland.
Investing in a country is like getting married.
First of all, if everything goes well, you get engaged and get married by making a long-term plan.
We are also married to Turkey and have no intention of divorce.
Turned from the threshold of the abyss!
Prime Minister Binali Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m spoke to his businessmen by teleconference at the meeting on “Trust in Turkey, Producers in Turkey” held by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry in the Swiss Hotel.
Prime Minister Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m, who said that the sector will provide Turkey with a comparative advantage, said: “In the industry sector, we also need to not squeeze the transition to Industry 4.0.”
“If the added value is high, our country’s locomotive, and we care about catching its 2023 goals, we need to think about the industrial revolution, along with the IT and technology revolution, and we need to achieve that,” he said.
On the night of July 15, Prime Minister Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m added that Turkey was returning from the threshold of a large rift: "Those who intend to destroy our country's future, those who are trying to destroy democracy, those who are not even afraid to bomb our Gaza Assembly, if they were the Turks."
We were going to talk about a Turkey among the 3rd world countries that was taken over by the strike, eliminated by the national will and fell out of the league of developing countries.
"Thank God, the foundation of our nation, our President, Mr Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's leadership and the determination of our government," he said.
Prime Minister Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m continued his words: “We will quickly emerge from the impact of this incident and look ahead.”
Living with a constant blow is never and never true.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake Turkey’s economy.
Those waiting for chaos and crisis were once again wrong.
Today, our democracy and our economy are on the brink of collapse.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to work in a healthy way.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit appears to have fallen by 25 percent.
The current deficit’s national income rate was 5.8 per cent in 2014, while it fell to 4.5 per cent in 2015.
At the end of the year, we are aiming to reduce to 4.
We're never going to change our stance on public spending.
Turkey’s 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We have reduced the national income ratio of the budget deficit of over 11% to 1.3% in 2015, and we are striving to maintain these rates.
We are in a better position than the EU in public debt than many countries in the world.
Our banking finance sector continues to operate on a solid ground.
“Despite July 15, our Central Bank did not need to put foreign exchange on the market, and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have a gross reserve of over $121 billion,” he said.
Prime Minister Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m said that the development of the economy will provide all kinds of ease for production growth and the creation of new employment areas, "We are also making comprehensive arrangements to recover from your burdens towards the past."
We have implemented a lot of regulations until the keep-in cash surplus and the re-assessment of unpaid tax debts has been brought back to an ease.
"You continue to produce for the country, you continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to lift the obstacles ahead of you one by one," he said.

As a result of the increase in sugar, Sermet <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>kr, who was hospitalized, continues to be treated at Sakarya Education and Research Hospital.
Turkey does not break from the West, does not give up the European Union
Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek: Turkey does not break from the West, does not give up the European Union
Vice President Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, Minister of Science and Technology Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlü, Minister of Economics Nihat Zeybekci Istanbul Industrial Chamber (ISO), attended the meeting on "Trusted in Turkey, Producers in Turkey".
Speaking at the meeting, Science Industry and Technology Minister Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlü said, "I think there are many good results from the developments that took place on and after the night of 15 July."
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and coexistence that the whole of Turkey is deeply feeling right now.
The July 15 process showed how robust the Turkish economy has dynamics, and how much society has internalized democracy.
"It is clear that the next process will be easier and faster for a society that has captured this level in the economy and in democracy and in democracy," he said.
"TURKEY'S CURRENT OF THIS SECURITY"
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci, who said that they were struggling to tell the world about the July 15 coup attempt from Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlü, said that as a government, they have declared transportation in this regard.
Zeybekci also recalled the interest cuts initiated by banks in recent times, "If 63.4% of the women of the first five faces of my real sector are going to be going at interest, we should focus on this whole business."
For him, our president is turning around and saying this thing.
With the real sector, with the banking system, with the government, with its politics, with the unity of politics after the civil Turkish democracy revolution of July 15, and together with Turkey must get rid of this trouble.
We welcome the recent developments in this regard as well.
"Hopefully, in the coming period, we will pursue the sustainability and continuity of this competitive economy, which is starting at nine zero points per month, with the encouragement of our President," he said.
"THE COUNTRY PASSPORT IS GIVEN TO THE EMIRINE OF OUR IMPORTANT"
"We will win the world in the next period," said Nihat Zeybekci, "we will not leave the door unbroken in the world under the leadership of our President, our Prime Minister."
We won't leave anyone we haven't contacted to increase our trade.
"We will never and will never forget this; we will not be the birds in our hands when we run after the bird in the field," he said.
Zeybekci also pointed out that exporters will be given a green passport in the future, "one of the last decisions that came out his law, we have now finished his regulation in the Ministry of Economy; our exporters gave about his passport, in the first figures, about 17 to 20 thousand of them.
"THE DEVELOPMENT FROM THE STATES IS COMING IN MY WORKING INTRODUCTION"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, referring to the coup attempt on July 15 and to the OHAL, which was declared after that, said that the deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek described the coup attempt as a "chaos" and said: "But it is behind us, we now need to look ahead."
For two simple reasons, <0xC5><0xA0>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek said that it was declared OHAL, "Of course, what is happening in this uprising needs to be cleared of the state of those who are in this coup attempt, and this process is working; but more importantly, they need to be seriously reformed in order not to face such coup attempts."
As a necessary climate for these administrative reforms, the Extraordinary State has been declared and very serious structural reforms have been made so far.
"When we do all this, of course, we have acted within the democratic principles and the rule of law, and we will continue to do so," he said.
Expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek stressed that there is no reason to worry about companies and individuals who are not involved in the financing of terrorism.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have solidified, because when you look at the origins of the problems of the recent past, you will see that this network of treason is at work.
"Therefore, the purge of this terrorist organization from the state, that this period is closing in Turkey will strengthen Turkey's democracy," he said.
Simsek, who stated that the foundations of the economy are generally sound and return to normal structural reform agendas again without ever losing time, "Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms."
Without structural reforms, we would not have already, because populism in the world is increasing protectionism.
“Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming,” he said.
Lastly, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek stressed that Turkey will not break from the West, "Turkey may from time to time have disagreements with our Western allies and friends, but Turkey does not break from the West, it does not give up the European Union."
He jumped into the sea from 25 meters and...
In Antalya, the 17-year-old Samil Tayyar Flaggist became a hospital when he jumped into the sea fishing from the 25-metre-high cliffs called the ‘Kartal Hill’.
Shamil, who swims with his friends on the coast of Konyaalt<0xC4><0xB1> in the evening, then jumps fishing from the 25-metre-high cliffs known as the "Kartal Hill" under the variant.
The professional swimmer, Samil Tayyar Flagg, injured his neck by impacting the water.
Difficult to move at sea, the Flaggator was taken ashore by his friends, who were once again professional swimmers like him.
Health officials who arrived at the scene of the incident after the intervention took Samil Tayyar Flagach<0xC4><0xB1> by ambulance to Antalya Education and Research Hospital.
It was recorded that there was no life hazard of the treated Flaggator.
A friend of the Flaggher, who testified to the police, "he injured his neck when he jumped fishing from Kartal Hill."
"We didn't expect that to happen," he said.
Twenty-five dead in the newspaper
Settlements in the village of Sarmada in Syria’s Idlib province, located about 10 kilometers from the Cilvegöze Border Gate in Hatay’s Reyhanli District, were shot down by regime planes.
Local sources said 25 people were killed in the attack and 40 were injured.
Two separate airstrikes were carried out by regime planes in the afternoon and in the hours of the attack on the town of Sarmada, controlled by opponents near the Bab-Al Air Border Gate in front of the Cilvegözu Border Gate.
Local sources said the planes were targeting settlements in the air strike and 25 people were killed.
According to reports, 40 people have been injured in the blast, while the number of deaths is feared to rise.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has elected Kaya to join the Y<0xC3><0x96>K!
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an elected Deputy Minister of Finance H. Abdullah Kaya to the Council of Higher Education (Y<0xC3><0x96>K).
In a statement made by the Presidency, "Our President, to the Member of the Board of Higher Education, vacated due to the resignation of Seyit Ahmet Ba<0xC5><0x9F>, is the Deputy of the Ministry of Finance in accordance with Article 6 b/1 of the Higher Education Act No. 2547."

In a statement made by the Presidential Press Center, "The "International Labour Law No. 6735" is published by our President in accordance with the second paragraph (a) of the first paragraph of Article 89 of the Constitution and the second paragraph of Article 104 of the Constitution."
Two brothers were killed in an armed attack in Kahta.
In ADIYAMAN's Kahta County, two brothers who were attacked with guns in a car lost their lives.
The incident took place on Mustafa Kemal Street in the evening.
A car with a 02 KH 839 plate under the administration of Ramazan Karahan headed towards the county center was fired with a gun by an unknown person.
The car in the Karahan administration, which lost control with the fire, stopped crashing another car.
Meanwhile, the person next to the car shot his brother next to Ramazan Karahan after the 50-year-old Umer Karahan.
The Karahan brothers fled the scene with a motorcycle while the attacker was seriously injured.
Police and health teams were dispatched at the scene of the incident.
The Karahan brothers, who were seriously injured, were taken to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Umer and Ramazan Karahan, who were treated in the emergency room, could not be rescued despite all the efforts of the doctors.
While the two brothers’ bodies were being placed in the morgue for autopsy, police investigating mobs and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred began work on the arrest of the fugitive by identifying the attacker.
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will provide renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London, but across the country.
I think it will make Heathrow quite appealing, as we did in London in 2012, for all these nations and regions to benefit from the Games.
The Olympics provided great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new internship opportunities for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave young people unemployed around the airport.
As in London before 2012, those who think that the fight to expand Heathrow is too difficult will emerge.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be disgusted with the whole world.
Those who doubted were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions asked.
As with the Olympics, Heathrow is not just an infrastructure project for a few, but for many.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth and leaves many skills and job opportunities around the airport as well as across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow from T5 (selected the best airport terminal in the world for five years back) to T2, who are implementing a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment on time and budget for the world’s two busiest runways.
We are now ready to offer a third track backed by private investment worth <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK and I have no doubt that the Heathrow expansion will be as well.
It’s time to channel this Olympic spirit into Heathrow’s expansion to secure our commercial future and create many skills and business opportunities that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow and former Secretary of Commerce at the Treasury Department.
Adblock Plus is “like a cat-fare game” about Facebook ad blocking
According to one of the companies that tried to block ad-blocking software for companies that made money from online advertisements, it resembles a “cat-fare game”.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying its users could update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around the ads to make it difficult for ad blockers to identify which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock now says it’s cracking the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that “it’s been an advanced backlash between the community and those who try to block open-source ads that’s been going on since ad blocking was invented,” and it’s possible that Facebook could produce its own solution soon.
The rise of the world’s largest social media company in this struggle shows how much concern ad blockers have raised for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people globally use ad blockers, which is four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
According to a spokesperson, mobile ad blockers for the social network are ineffective on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram, and are chasing ad blockers on the company’s desktop.
As Facebook sees it worth investing in such a move, it should still be in a position to provide enough revenue for desktop ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook again announced it would update its “advertising preferences” tool so that people can better control the advertisements that are presented to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying, and that they would also block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement: "These people don't have a good experience and we plan to deal with this problem."
Ad blockers are a blinded tool, so we’re focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman ran into the Swiss motorway; the incident looks like suicide
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police are looking for people who witnessed several cars hit the woman on the highway early on Thursday in a suicide-like incident.
The incident occurred just after midnight on Thursday at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman was lying on the ground "desperately" in the dark of the night and several vehicles hit her.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman, who apparently wanted to kill herself, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He lost his life at the scene.
Police said several of the drivers involved were interviewed, but some were undetectable, and asked them and everyone involved in the incident to refer to themselves.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter said in a statement to the Le Tribune that "a "reasonable" sentence has been opened as a step to be taken in such cases."
However, it is not yet known whether the drivers involved in the incident will face any charges.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
That's what the prosecutor needs to determine," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years indicate that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases in the newspaper (both involving a person getting off the highway in the dark), it was ruled that it was normal for drivers not to wait for a pedestrian to cross the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, on an A1 night in August 2014, a police officer was found innocent of causing death due to negligence caused by a hit-and-run man on the road near Payerne.
The court said the 22-year-old was drunk and broke into the road.
The court said the vehicle was reasonably used by a police officer responding to an emergency call and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation.”
Those who know about the incident that took place near Morges on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus used to live once
According to estimates of the new NASA climate model, there were once-appropriate living conditions on Venus.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus was once home to conditions similar to Earth, with a warm, water-free surface and an atmosphere full of CO2.
In the past, scientists were explaining the low rotational speed of Venus with a thick layer of atmosphere.
But the latest predictions suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still be able to return slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the ancient Venus.
While there were more dry areas of the planet than Earth, it may have once had protection against water and rapid evaporation by geographic variability.
Ancient Venus was also benefiting from a sun that was 30 percent looser.
GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news bulletin: “In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow turn of Venus made the dayside turn to the sun for almost two months each time.”
This led to rains, which formed thick cloud layers, moving like an umbrella that protects the surface from solar heat by heating the surface.
As a result, only a few degrees colder average climatic temperatures emerged today than Earth is.
The model allowed Venus to create a story similar to the evolution that planetary scientists had previously hypothesized.
Although Venus once had the right conditions for life, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
The oceans evaporated and the water vapor disappeared by burning with ultraviolet rays.
Hydrogen is exhausted, and there is a thick atmosphere full of carbon dioxide with only the effect of deadly greenhouse gases; that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in their Geophysics Research Papers.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche antenna
Patrick Roy resigned as vice president of Colorado Avalanche coaching and hockey operations on Thursday, saying the team was not given the right to make a decision.
Joe Sakic, Colorado’s vice president of administration and general manager, confirmed the development and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement: “Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination.
Throughout the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve further and take this team to a higher level by giving it the depth it needed.
To achieve this, the coach and the vision of VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the organization’s vision.
In addition, decisions that affect the performance of the team itself should also have the right to speak.
At present, these conditions have not yet been met.
Sakic, who joined Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We thank him for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach in the first season of 2013-14 with the Avalanche.
The club scored 112 points and made the team finish first in the league but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the play-off season and missed out on postseason games every two years.
Avalanche scored 39-39-4 in 2015-16 and scored five points less than needed for the second joker field at the Western Conference.
Roy, the keeper on the Honours List, won four Stanley Cups for both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Continue to Suspend Strike Talks
The strike was suspended due to the salaries of oil workers in the North Sea and the chief negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oil field services company Wood Group is being carried out gradually on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
In a joint statement, “We have decided to restart the process for resolving the existing dispute with Unite and RMT trade unions,” the statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will be holding a series of meetings that will take place all day to adopt a new perspective on the issues from the beginning of next week.
Labor unions said the protest was their first action in 25 years against wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, the Wood Group cut payments to contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressures.
After this fee reduction process, the company also applied a 10% price reduction to its contractors on the coast in 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would provide the space for the company to go through a difficult period in the market.
Shell has laid off thousands of people while it is organizing operations in the merger process with British energy company BG Group, and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low crude oil prices, which were a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson will meet with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest workers’ conflicts in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
In a statement, he said, “We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the minority in the North Sea and the country as a whole.”
Despite an average investment of around $7 billion over the past five years, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016.
Kepler measured the rotational speed of the stars in the Ülker team star
The Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers with their last mission to create the most complete catalog of stars in the Ülker cluster star in terms of rotational speeds.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster star rotate at a variable rate and how their periods of rotation are related to the formation of the planet.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news bulletin: "When we compare our results with clusters of stars, the mass of a star is more than ours, the age, and even the history of the solar system."
The country team star is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in the team star formed 125 million years ago and reach a new level of maturity.
They're turning at the highest speed they can get in their lives.
At peak rotation speeds, the stars at this stage of maturation form a large amount of stellar wind.
These winds form a refractive effect on stars as they progress in the magnetic fields of stars.
As a star ages, the speed of rotation begins to decline.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by observing the time between the appearance of conspicuous stellar spots such as sunspots.
The latest rotational velocities catalog suggests that larger stars rotate faster than small stars.
Rebull stated that by resembling the stars to dancers, those who are big on one foot performed their turn more slowly than those who are small.
Rebull said, “We see that the slower spinners in the Earth’s ‘balance’ are much heavier and the fast spinners are very light stars.”
Since the country team is very close to the star, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare its rotational velocities with its stellar characteristics.
Rebull said: "The Earth team provides theoretical models for star rotations in both directions as young and old as they are."
There’s more we want to learn about how, when and why the stars’ turn speeds fall, and why they leave their ‘dancing shoes’ in a corner, of course.
Rebull and his colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the team's rotational speeds in three new articles to be published in the Journal of Astronomy in a short time.
