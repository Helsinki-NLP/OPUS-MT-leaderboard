Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and, above all, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the UK and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, is updated daily at 8 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculate the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of reported cases for each country by March 15, 2020 at 8 a.m., and compare it with that of Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
He points out that by March 15 at 8 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy three weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including testing for update.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital and/or ICU hospitalization for COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of ICU and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to saturation of health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a 90% higher risk of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment.
In view of the fact that cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on intensive care cases and beds should preferably be made available in the NUTS Nomenclature for these Territorial Units.
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who will need medical care, mainly intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases expected to be implemented may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to adapt.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and lower the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which is developing rapidly.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay confined throughout the holiday and for several weeks following due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus has a great similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its disease was named CoV-19 disease (COV-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number one,” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first patient report on January 7, 2020.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Whenever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have found twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with terrifying morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in documented human history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins were initially reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of onset of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation worsens rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the epidemic still needs to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study of several centers with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age range of 30 to 65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread to groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single RNA chain with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors of the angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and subsequent membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles that contain viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequential samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ECA2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the human ECA2 protein weaker than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the full length human ECA2 cryo-EM structure to a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through squirrels and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes transport the bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that pangolins, elongated snail mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the pang-Coberon-V2 genetic homology of the 99%.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being expected (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are, for the most part, still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can consult only previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectin type C receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR) and R-type IGR receptor.
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigen macrophages.
However, SARS-CoV’s N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as the C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, more affects the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, and most often 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who have no symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to be in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, coriander, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory fever and/or symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the imaging diagnosis of the lung, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a grouping with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of higher MERS mortality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnoea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilation support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in relation to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much bigger challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually present a travel or residency history in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and treated patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral blood white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in chest x-rays are present in most patients with COVID-19, and exhibit bilateral irregular shadows or opacity in dark glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest x-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the peeling of pneumothics, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytic cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the diseaseRS and patient's pathology smelt to the pathology of viral infection SARS and SD.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which became not derived only from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable for achieving an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a complex protocol of using the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L minus one input time i instrumentation at 200 x 10-18 mol/L, using a var-free medrole (10 to 100 microns per copy).
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases.
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of treated patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs with expression of ECA2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary technique used to treat severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine cascade is known to result from an exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for the cytokine cascade include modulation of the targeted immune response to T cells; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for serious lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with low to moderate doses of corticosteroids were recommended for caution in patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single ribbon RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound to China to perform some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very much expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of treated patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have been cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, treated patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in a serious condition.
His symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale prior to the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from treated patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make a screening for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
This way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and check these components or their excellent combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rates of treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, got the lowest rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were considerably lower in the group treated by Western medicine and CTC than in the group treated by Western medicine alone.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the Western Medicine and CMT group than for the Western Medicine alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the Western Medicine and CMT group than in the Western Medicine alone group (39% versus 8%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of MTC are still awaiting more properly controlled tests at larger scales and at more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and to explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychosis symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies, were reported.
Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health system’s actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they can feel guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of the disease and people who have had contact with them, as well as the general population, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop S-based vaccines to generate powerful and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS outbreaks continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without any consequences.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a model of prognosis for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive care (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that patient health is a prognostic factor for the outcome.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ECA2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Correlation of CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressly present in various organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest x-rays and time progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for predicting the outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Steroid Usage: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants typically used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the deaths of loved ones of family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or only cause mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the ongoing quarantine of nearly the entire population, in hopes of stopping SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends by March, and the deceleration phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the scabies of the throat and middle cornea of patients who recovered and received discharge from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified may become a cyclic influenza-like episode.
However, promising indications have occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in terms of its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and that of MERS can be found below (Fig. (Fig. 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in faeces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-faecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series no. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being transported into the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only N95 masks (series no. 1860s) protect against inhalation of virions ranging in size from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series no. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care professionals should wear isolation wardrobes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent face protectors or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a great alert to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, it was only on January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproducibility among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was missed.
China’s disease control agencies can take advantage of this tough lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, as everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals; (4) be more sensitive to them and react to them, rather than to expect formal communications from doctors and authorities.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a sense of SARS return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which creates a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic counterpart has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with expression of ECA2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it have seasonal recurrence, like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the questions above and for so many others.
However, regardless of the necessary efforts, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild illness, such as a common cold.
Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought of CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted CoVS again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its SARS-CoV brother.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous utility.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigation of CoV host interactions in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we make comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current CoV disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for an effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated viruses, of positive polarity, and of single ribbon RNA.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their corona morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open-reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins of replication pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genera contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the bark of patients with common colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating today and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts, with important implications in the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental HCoV viruses are generally non-pathogenic in their hosts natural reservoirs, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the corise of patients who had contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, camel, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Over the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented HCoV pandemic in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of the "overspreaders", it was estimated that each infected person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak of viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, mainly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of cortisone, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to undergo mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent tra-infective subtype of the re-infectant HCoV-NL63, which has been re-reported.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be efficiently transmitted and to continually remain in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary propagation for close contacts have been reported in several European countries and in Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore quite peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high confirmed-case mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
From mid to late December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named COVID-19 disease.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the fatality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the mortality outside of this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they group into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is a little lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the orofecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its transition to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
The HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious diseases of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as the HCoVs acquired by the community, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediary animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it houses a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts the HCoV in a continuous and lasting way.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not suit the new host properly, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to transiently replicate and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it is unable to sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies of soroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of antiSARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a dog-guaxinim in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was reported after the slaughter of all civites in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farmed masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate host amplifier, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as SARS-CoV amplifier intermediate hosts cannot be excluded.
All of these animals seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, named Rhinolophus-related bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese ferret bat.
These bats are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88 to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, except the designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from bat fecal samples has been shown to use bats, civites and humans ECA2 as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of SARS convalescent patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest SARS-CoV ancestral in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent SARS-CoV virus, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidease 4 (DPP4), for entry of the virus.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to betaCoV counterparts of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to Middle Eastern camels in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from dromedary nasal scrubs, increasing the evidence that the camels serve as the legitimate MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that usually mild symptoms, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit the viruses not only through the respiratory pathway, but also through the fecal-oral pathway, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, there are still no responses, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be plausibly attributed to transmission between people or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a bat RaTG13 CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts should be configured among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial COVID-19 cases have been associated, indicating a likely event of transmission from animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also house SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They cluster into SARS-CoV-2-like virus underlines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology across the genome.
A recent study on patient pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins due to the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 from pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of the betaCoVs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 proceeds from the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterargument is in favour of recombination between betaCoV of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses were detected in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also suspicion that camelids are its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current knowledge on the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for HCoVs interspecies transmission events throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of bat virus to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alphaCoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphaCoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas obtain HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a very mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to civites, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the host reservoir of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had just been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross the barriers of the species.
First, their mutation rate is relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to other single ribbon RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered from "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of approximately 10-4 replacements per year, per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with revision mechanism, the exclusion of which results in excessive mutability and mitigation, or even inviolability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir suppresses CoV replication through inhibition of exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is low, apparently, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who keeps in touch with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of RNA in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the genome end.
Thirdly, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, ribbon exchange often occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs, such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Viral-host interaction with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolates from humans and civites, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensively selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318<0xC2><0xB0> to 510<0xC2><0xB0> in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its corrector receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognize the ECA2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civites, mice and guaxin dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral and civetate isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the civets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike protein with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10- to 20-fold greater affinity for this link than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine if any other receptors may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also be responsible for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence on the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and hosts of natural reservoirs of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp dependency factors with the host and subvert host restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of host-virus interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
Non-tendency screening with genomic range of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero stake
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but it has been found that they encode diverging ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion feature of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the onset of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic went through recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to undesirable changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as the host's immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E related bat and camel viruses, alpaca alphaCoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when they were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Fleas are likely to be well adapted to anatomically and physiologically CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural destroyer cells in bats is suppressed due to adaptation of the natural destroyer cell inhibitor receptor NKG2/CD94, and to the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen (ERO) species generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the review by exorribonuclease, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains upon being introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of proteins or new protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
So it’s no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or at most cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without provoking a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine cascade, in which the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was switched off from CoV replication.
The same strategy of turning off the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammation in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was found that bat betaCoV shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin betaCoVs, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin betaCoVs may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civics in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civics in those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of this transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels for control of MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people will be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle from the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, a pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspicious case” and “confirmed case” of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to diagnosing and treating 2019’s new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference for fighting this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; for this reason, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a commentary on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guideline published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experience in clinical practice; for this reason, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a review from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse his significant work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine one item of epidemiological history elements with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to meet three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history and so on: (1) a history of travel or residency in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2, or a history of histo (3) positive nucleic acid test.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging diagnostic features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case serotype must be based on the case of suspected fa2 in the case of any of the following: (1) PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the same viral genome displaying high specific homogeneity in relation to the new known anti-coronaviruses.
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and sorological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to pay attention to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we look forward to the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bengali Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would remain paralyzed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the world exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections as of Thursday.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended to the entire day the duration of the touch of collecting in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3pm to 6pm.
Thailand plans to implement pick-up touch from 22h to 4h
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Stores in Australia Reduce Toilet Paper Limits Per Transaction
On Saturday and Sunday night, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the restrictions on buying toilet paper to two packages and one package per transaction at all stores in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and Facebook pages of the networks.
Out of fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases with home delivery for one package per order.
These changes came after the previous four-pack per-transaction restriction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that, even with the four-pack restriction, “many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery” and called the demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI called it “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "sharp increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks of a promotion planned for Wednesday in advance.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local board restrictions on the frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
It expects high production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday’s promotion.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish stock every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper is a voluminous item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, it leaves many empty spaces in the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion that if there was an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [buyed] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives Crap said on Wednesday that they would be out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to a report from News.com.au.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering on holiday on the extended Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin daily print, included an eight-page insert aimed at being trimmed and used as toilet paper.
Initially, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — is a pandemic.
While the word “pandemic” only indicates the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an “unprecedented” pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that “other than the flu, no other respiratory virus has been monitored since its emergence until the continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus."
“We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO’s January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak "in short, will worsen."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuous coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping distance from people and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantine, pick-up touches, workplace risk controls and closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused a severe global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic-induced shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the student population in the world.
The misinformation about the virus spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were linked to the wholesale market for Huanan seafood, and therefore, the virus is believed to have zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has a close connection with bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with symptoms that are known to have become ill on December 1, 2019 and did not present any visible links to the group.
Of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds were connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, a new unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, which may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO first case reported that, as reported by China's new reported cases, the number decreased in China and passed from China, but suddenly increased in South Korea.
There may be significant under-notification of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s leading scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had tested positive for COVID, according to the protocol.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without taking the test, for example, who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of COVID deaths by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know [the official death toll] is underestimated,” a statement corroborated by episodic reports of under-notification in the U.S. This underestimation of 2020 confirms and often occurs in pandemics.
The first death outside of China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality factor represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a certain interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global fatality ratio is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the estimates of the fatality coefficient have fallen from 17.3% (in people with the onset of symptoms between 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with the onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the non-lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with the onset of the onset of the onset of the onset of the symptoms.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of the infection through resolution of the case.
Some scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the rate of infection lethality for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, from Pennsylvania State University, said: “Without proper control, infectious epidemics usually peak and then decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when that will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said it could "end by June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "is likely to continue in circulation for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, as it’s highly transmissible” and “that it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year.”
The virulence of recurrence will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catharma), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. The WHO states that approximately one in six people presents with reflux.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are difficulty breathing, pain or pressure in the chest persisting, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloration due to evolutive scabies. It is advised to seek medical help, if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, the researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with a confirmed infection be monitored and closely examined to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but usually is five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and subsequently fell to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or speaking, the near contact being considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets can also be produced during expiration, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The droplets may land in the mouths and noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in propagation by air.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the stools, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or fecal. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible before even the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person is usually infected by two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to the humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans, however, British authorities advise washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of related coronaviruses in their nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from home soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (B lineage). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, across the genome level, to other samples of coronavirus from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found, at most, 92% sharing of genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “TC not be used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually made available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal scrubbing, although scrubbing of the throat is also used. Various laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these had proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The peculiarities of X-rays and computerized tomography (CT) images of symptomatic people include asymmetrical, dark-glass opacities and absence of pleural strokes.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of thoracic CT to those of PCR and showed that although the image is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of imaging characteristics of the virus with X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or spitting on a paper towel and putting this towel directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that people who have been infected should wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended to healthcare professionals who care for individuals who may be infected to use the standard precautionary measures, the post-mortem precautionary measures for contact and eye protection.
The use by governments of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinsing their noses and gagging with coluteries, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working to develop one.
Washing your hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. Also wash their hands before eating and after sneezing their nose, coughing or spitting.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
The WHO recommends that you avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (in up to one minute of exposure to the disinfectant to a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropyl alcohol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, iodine at 0.5% and iodine at 2 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should not be.
Health organizations recommend covering your mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a paper towel when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any towel.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of expiratory droplets displacement when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “The use of masks can reduce people’s propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene.”
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as carers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when in close contact with another person (walking 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical mask is recommended when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone who enters supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has demanded that passengers on intercity trains and buses wear face masks from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use a mask for the face when going out on the street. At the same time, it is recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone when staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping away from others.
Currently, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in one region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, the German authorities may prohibit the public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and other compromised immune systems. In the event that they face the greatest risk of serious diseases and complications, in the event that they are
The use of the term "social distancing" led to implications that social isolation was needed completely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who doesn’t have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspected they were infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quarantine instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with large-scale transmission have been advised to do 14 days of self-quarantine since the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as present other measures of infection control and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to slow down the rate of spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time, in combination.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproduction rate of less than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. We call this "purchase of the epidemic curve".
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
interventions that are not of a pharmaceutical nature and that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as the hygiene of the hands, the use of masks for the face and self-quarantine; Community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to agglomerations.
Other countries have taken various measures to make the spread of the virus limited.
South Korea, for example, has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and the government has issued alerts on the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when performing self-quarantine and, for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, increased production of face masks occurred and those who stocked medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the decrease in the rate of infection, without stopping with the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e., the reversal of the cremation).
Ideal reduction policies can reduce peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Yet, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overburdening health systems at the same time.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is circulating by the human population or until there is availability of a vaccine, if this occurs earlier. Otherwise, the transmission occurs again as soon as the measures are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts towards the development of drugs, which include testing existing drugs.
Using cold medications that do not require a prescription, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some "marital and traditional" medications can alleviate symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
The WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as fundamental measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services in order to displace, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for testing COVID-19 and positives in the patients.
There are various theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were, in large part, linked to the wholesale market of seafood from Huanan. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On the 26th of December, a group of patients from Jipio was observed that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus of the SARS type”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading fake news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, on December 31, made a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year’s migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub, as well as a main railway connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were recovered. 36.000 died, more than 97.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The reactions of the countries included containment measures, such as quarantine (also known as home confinement orders, home confinement orders or lockdown) and pick-up touches. On April 2, about 300 million people (nearly 90% of the population) are confined to confinement in the United States of America.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26. Her hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A communiqué to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan doctors were warned by police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of transmission between humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping, as a “people’s war,” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the greatest quarantine in human history,” a sanitary cordon was announced on Jan. 23 to interrupt round trips to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations, on January 25, were cancelled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Along with the newly built hospitals, China has turned 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the extension of the festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were made in Hubei and outside of it.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement control was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) went through some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of viruses from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case, through a traveller who returned to Guangzhou coming from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on March 26, 2020, that the entry of individuals with visa or residence permit would be suspended as of March 28, when policy on this specific details.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to the companies. The State Council declared a day of mourning, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence in the whole country, on April 4, on April 19th, giving home to the celebrations of a weekday, coincides with the Qingming Festival.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country’s national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported symptoms. South Korea declared a maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All of South Korea's military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of population screening for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual reporting of symptoms for those arriving from international travel via a mobile app, drive-thru virus testing, with results available the next day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not put entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided over the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment under the allegation of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising its response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be put under quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid covert allegations of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency said there was a greater risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions such as detention centres, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the start of the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 politicians in office or retired and government officials died as a result of the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than are being reported.
It is suggested that U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group unassociated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21, the Council of Ministers announced a decree on February 22 to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the areas of the outbreak, people's entry and exit are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government called for the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy hit 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, will have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, the Prime Minister Conte, called for the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies.

As of April 5, it had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus up to that point may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the countries affected, and by 18 March 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the recognized lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement advising the interruption of all possible non-essential travel and social contact restaurants.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies should be closed as soon as possible, and committed to pay 80% of the wages of workers up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid people's unemployment during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issuance of fines and the dispersal of agglomerations.
Most businesses have received orders to close, with exceptions for businesses considered “essential,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and car workshops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start to the tests, which concealed the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The testing was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government test kits (from academies, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be subtested by early March (a medical application was required).

On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa, and on April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government “provided regular updates to avoid near-family panic in the lunar New Year.”
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that certainly was not a recommendation of the WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated."
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was invoked due to the “risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel."
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund a strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to help those countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people who contract the virus, even if it arises."
Tedros made subsequent statements stating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community "to invest now or have to pay later." On February 11, the WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to provide “the power of the entire United Nations system in response.”
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated as a result, enabling the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which WHO states will allow them to “concentrate on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint task force of the World Health Organization (WHO) in China was authorized to provide international experts and the WHO on land in China with assistance in domestic management and to evaluate "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main institutions at the national level and to conduct field visits.

Mike Ryan, executive director of the emergency health program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be ready,” insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan further stated that current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction." The WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and a classification of the virus.
The reaction included a petition to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to present his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental health problems, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, people detained, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International governmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthening health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital center includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, by the UK’s Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo Bolsonaro for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected early recognition of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus" saying that China's censorship "superpowered a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to divert it."
The Daily Beast obtained from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy cited as "This all has to do with China.
It was advised that we try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased viewpoint and 'politics of generosity'."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China has also called on the United States to suspend its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
And listen to disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union’s lack of solidarity with those affected by the Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said: "Only China has responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio dispensed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they will also act reciprocally if necessary."
NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.
Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts the lives not only of the US troops and the various European countries that are participating in it, but of the well-off politicians of the countries in which they operate."
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to the leaders of the world, asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is in trouble to combat the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran.
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-electing as president in the 2020 election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticised Japan’s ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at places designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment in respect of those they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising its response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those deemed to have spread fake news about the virus and the government’s management of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of shortages of supplies, due to increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier disruptions.
Several locals also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this would jeopardize the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from one.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that were envisaged in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not observe a large reduction, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released reserves of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.

The German Reduced Hour Work Remuneration Program was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or delayed.
In response, intensive efforts have taken place to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and highly accelerating impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion events.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been cancelled.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS - CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of mortality of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still significantly affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal scrubbing or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal scrubbing is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the material of the samples can be removed from the bottom of the respiratory tract by suction catheter or material ejected by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the real-time Ret<0xC3><0xAD>nto "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for emergency use from the National Medical Products Administration of China.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests based on defective reagents, and an impediment to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then local and state laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an authorization for emergency use. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics has also made COVID-19 tests nationwide available as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; the collection and processing of the samples should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, such period, Roche Diagnostics received a 24 hours test, in 4 hours, in the process of doing it, it was done by the FDA in 5 hours, in a process that could allow for a test.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a US FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it particularly to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus as it provides minutes as a result of a 20-year-old coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of 20.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that “ chest x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings, computerized tomography, may be present even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features in TC include bilateral multilobal opacities in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to TC in Wuhan at the origin point of the current pandemic suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of its image aspects matching other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial checkup.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals started 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
Automated high-productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an authorization for emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in the sample.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong organized a system in which the patient's patient's presupposes can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sampling tube for the patient", they must expel saliva in the tube, send it back and get a result shortly afterwards. The British NHS has announced that they are coordinating a system to test the patient's cases in the hospital.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea conduct some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the capacity for about 12,000 tests per week before being in outpatient care.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.

With the construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modelling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if that testing capability did not have online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open-source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were launched as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be run in small labs without the need to maneuver.
In March, shortages or insufficient amounts of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the UK and the US.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for additional tests. On March 31, it was reported that the United Arab Emirates populations reach n are now doing more testing per inhabitant and other parts of the population of the Coronavirus.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capability, and the acquisition of a Group 42 and BGI population-scale mass processing laboratory (inspired by its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany’s method of manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was a delay in the tests made available to the U.S. and to China and the U.S. has faced problems with the reliability of the test kits for resuscitation test kits well at the beginning of the outbreak, and also those countries
On the other hand, experts say that South Korea’s wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to delay the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented “failures”; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Minister of Spain said it would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the Turkey test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that they would not "use them". The United Kingdom was not <0xC3><0xBA>m <0xC3><0xBA>is that acquired the China's 3.5 million test kits, but in the beginning.
The testing, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom people positive for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With the shift to the restricted commune, this completely eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and outlets.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to seriously advise residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened within the planned after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed more tests, compared to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are more able to detect those with no or few symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % of tests" column is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that tests only people hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing your hands with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., the mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's bum or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling raw meat, fresh or fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be sanitized with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand sanitation:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After swollen nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main goal of washing your hands is to clean your hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lowering the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can cause small improvements in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water for deficient areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as automatic behavior carried out in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, transforming handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom in a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhoea deaths by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections in one room.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and sanitation programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions as a function of skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause skin scaling and irritation known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the toilet (micking, defecation), after cleaning a child’s bum (exchanging diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or carnage.
Other situations when the correct technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching in garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 has found that on average 38.7% of households had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index at 97 percent. The United States has the highest index at 77 percent. and China has the lowest index at 23 percent.
The “Essential Health Services Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
Deparasitation twice a year, complemented by washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC reiterates “liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the health-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even though antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and anti-skin protective agents, the complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, benzoic acid active antimicrobial and other effective moisturizers for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, health extracts).
Warm water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand sanitizing agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous hand sanitizers based on alcohol (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, antiseptic, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a humectant, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate the use and reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygienizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.999% effective counter-hygis (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol-based sanitizers can be used to moisturize or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Finger tips should also be well washed, being rubbed with both hands. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid destructive action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause drying of the skin unless skin emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and drying than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The minor tendency to provoke irritative contact dermatitis has become attractive when compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically been very low on alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have revealed to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has revealed to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or earth.
Grey or earth may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Squeeze for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or leave to dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and lacquered enamels can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands moisturized; dry skin can cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or coil with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as other areas such as schools or rural areas for developing countries), there are solutions.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a foot-driven lever to drain a small amount of water into your hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel papers are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by the towel paper, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying their hands with heated air, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air-jet dryers resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area close to the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying their hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also carried out tests to determine whether there was potential for cross contamination among other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of method.
The air-jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the environment in up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms to up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for drying the hands were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after drying of the hands were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with moistened hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Hand sanitizers based on alcohol should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that rates of infection decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to savour and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the intertwining of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can lower the rate of catheter-related infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the sectors of the health system.
The organization’s hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if regulatory compliance is required to be demonstrated.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body fluids/blood
before an ascetic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soaps) confers an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which organisms resistant to antibiotics are predominant. In order to "clean" the hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed others after washing it without touching it with the hands.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water on the forearms should not flow into the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are washed with a sterilized towel and the surgical bathrobe is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after treating a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a minor additional benefit was obtained when the frequency of cleaning exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing the hygiene of the hands with an alcohol-based solution with the washing of the hands 2 redudin<0xC3><0xA1>l handwashing with an antibacterial soap in more than one bacool in the base of the soap that rebuilt it for an average time of 30 seconds each.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores in the hands. Interventions to increase hand sanitation in hospital environments can involve hand sanitizers to increase hand sanitizers and toilets.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health facilities.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool to have an even better health and nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for hand washing in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of the universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most of rural Africa taps for hand washing near any public or private toilets are rare, although there are cheap options for building hand washing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing may instead be the result of rooted habits and not the absence of soap and water.
The incentive and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and cause a long-term change in population behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is the "three-star approach" that ensures their handshakes between "three-star approach" and "simple approach" that encourages schools.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the maximum three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of promotional campaigns for hand-washing carried out with the aim of reducing disease and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has announced the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries relative to the DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers injured in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand sanitation: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis's "Florafunda" and "Florafunda" from the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Ningreu, Vienna.
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have caused increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "technics for proper hand washing" were hung near sinks for hand washing in public toilets and in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing hands” means declaring the reluctance to take responsibility or be congruent with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a more general use phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and often attach more importance to hand-washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other “cleansing” compensatory acts, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> faith, the Hinduism, the Hinduism, the Tevilah, and the Netil<0xC3><0xA1>t in the Jewish.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam allow handwashing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam allow washing hands before and after meals.
Workplace Hazard Controls for COVID-19
Occupational hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies to occupational hazard controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, who may be vulnerable to contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), the functions with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and with other colleagues, for which basic measures of infection prevention are recommended, including washing your hands, encouraging employees to stay at home without work, and encouraging employees to stay at home if they are from work.
Functions with an average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of being contaminated with COVID-19 but may be infected due to current Community transmission or because they have traveled abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public as in schools, high-population work environments, and in the large-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective covers, and the availability of individual protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in the health system and in the necroteria who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed or suspected aerosol generation and collect or handle people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have various effects in the workplace.
Workers can leave work because they get sick, because they have to take care of other people, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing these products (such as shopping outside peak hours or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, shipping items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be discontinued. An action plan and preparedness for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparedness plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on the worker’s behavior, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or working procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (IPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPIs should be selected based on the hazard to the worker, adjusted as necessary (e.g. respirators), used as appropriate and continuously, regularly inspected, preserved and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of as appropriate to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Labor Health and Safety (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other work colleagues.
turpentine basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous washing of hands, the incentive for workers to stay at home if they are sick and the use of the respiratory tag, including covering the sneeze and coughing, the preparation of the sneeze for the sneeze, the sneeze for the sneeze, the preparation of the sneeze, the ssneeping for the s and the sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who present symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms of this condition for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to re-enter the fever or relief of other symptoms.
According to OSHA, studies with average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known if they are confirmed patients or suspected of COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 re-transmittance country with high-severe transmission of the virus, because it has a re-several community transmission in the locality of the company.
These include the following services: services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, services, and services.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolation of the sick person from the other people for a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a face mask, or ask the sick person to sneeze at the mouth or nose.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be discarded in a bio-hazard waste bag, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other vessels presenting to the center during the communiqué with passengers, hazard checks include the delay of the journey through the passenger.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, strategies of social distancing can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical education classes or corals, or meals in a snack bar, increasing the space between the tables at san<0xC3><0xBA>dias, separating children with no-grinding arrival and departure times for a more rigid place of use, not-seeking.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dispensations may be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who contact individuals suspected of COVID-19 or with the confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for the containment and disposition of used EPI and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health workers and necrotists to be in high-risk or very high-exposure categories.
Functions with high risk of exposure include workers in drug delivery, medical care, laboratory and medical transport, who are exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Works in high-exposure necrotheria include workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure to make too high if they perform autopsy. They perform additional engineering checks when patient checks are done with these risk groups.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation can be suitable in some necroteria scenarios and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with caution at level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter the hospital be separated into two different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case of COVID-19. In addition to other PPIs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals who perform prophylaxis in a 6-foot distanceVesso to prophylaxis-to-suspension patients.
In the United States, N95 particulate-filtered facial respirators, approved by NIOSH, or superior-quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirator can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. The WHO does not recommend wearing trousers, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-breathing body fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall supply of asspriesti EPIs is insufficient, the WHO recommends the minimization of the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers as clear windows, allowing only those involved in the direct care of patients to enter into a room with one patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary EPI for the specific task.

[Covid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
DATE/DATE OF SHIPPING: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community-building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, connections and conversations is a remarkable validation of the incredible human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared their appreciation for our work with me.
This person reminded me how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful it is a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, as you keep the workplaces active, pay our colleagues and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we believe to be an appropriate action for what we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to end the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to be absent for a while, no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectancy will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise arranged.
We're not declaring a holiday. If you can work on normal hours, it might be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy food or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedule.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule wouldn't even have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No certificate or paid leave is required. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedule to ensure key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan about the training and certification sector so that his sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention.)
Employees who work per hour will receive full payment.
We’ve said this before, and we’re committed to honoring our commitment to our employers and employees who work by the hour.
Everyone will receive their salaries based on their normal work file under normal circumstances.
Salaries are independent if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We only ask you to communicate to your manager, so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to carry out.
Site Reliability, HR, Reliability and Security Engineering and Fundraising teams (among others) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current goals and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to do for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We do not intend to “work folded to recover lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impracticable.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precautionary measure, we employ an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its visitors.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our office in Washington changed to a completely remote setup, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and send materials for reading in advance.
Use videos by default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make collaboration and real-time connection easier.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor questions in the chat and list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aids to buy snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community support to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We notify you that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete your agreed subsidy activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The overall feeling in the global community seems to be of sadness with the paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to stay focused on their own communities, on Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on the Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all other information related to COVID-19 in the company wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you might need help with, don’t hesitate to notify it and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a sensitive or confidential matter, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations for HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at this time our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months to come.
We need all of you for this to happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that you are in your best condition when needed.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn N, M Ryan N).
The type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and elevating Ang (1-7), becoming a promising drug aimed at treating cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptide domain and a C-terminal amino acid transporter domain and collectrin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II pulmonary alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth arterial muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatal body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
ACE cleaves the type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Pro-Hyste-G).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradycinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates transport through the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 acts as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike protein S1 from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results have been less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infused rhACE2 acupuncture has been evaluated in clinical trials for treatment.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to help monitor in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced together that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking app was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar app is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if app acceptance is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple sets limits to the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to their App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of the data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as evidence-based;
digital surveillance should prevent the aggravation of discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
There should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a unique app, the system gathered tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate alerts via text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made the location information publicly available, which is allowed due to changes to the information confidentiality laws comprehensively following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
By April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) targeting others to register a next.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Pro Event Contact) and SentoCPAs for Mobile (TCN, fka)
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication “Apps play dirty: maintaining personal privacy in an epidemic” released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a startup that develops privacy technologies and was originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and accountables without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that united around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alerting and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government’s official app, had become open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system envisages implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps while preserving privacy
Integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to address the persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reproposal, reprofiling, reassignment, or therapeutic replacement) is the reproposal of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable project of development of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that he then perfected and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in his preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate (EUE chloroquine phosphate through an Authorization U.E.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is authorised through the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive the treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they are using the drug when "there is no other option."
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU’s Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to base the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about targeting resources to repropose drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and infection with Marburg virus. Gilead Sciences found that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against fleas, pneumonia, paramixus and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring in people hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other does not have a control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical test of Alvesco (cyclesonide) from the Teijin company, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is underway with 200 patients, to be recruited among the serious cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Currently, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the function of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods have not been included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study with 300 patients is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and in therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in the sense of giving new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease vaccine (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with completed clinical trials, there are several attempts underway to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investment and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 platforms of diverse technologies being researched and under development during early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The goals of the major platforms that have advanced to Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being projected).
A phase I-II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-developing vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in humans (they are still in pre-clinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular clamp, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work for the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the elaboration of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were initiating a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans “in the next 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command in Fort Detrick and the Army Research Institute Walter Reed in Silver Spring, both in the western Maryland region, announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for pre-clinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolated individuals and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least a year and a half to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a Coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the lab, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine” under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in pre-clinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could leave for human testing in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Preparing for Epidemic (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the investment of COVID for total investment 29 at the University of Pittsburgh.
CEPI’s other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an RNA self-amplifying vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the test of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in rats, stating that "MNA delivered vaccines from the SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 that started after week evident responses of specific antibodies to rats."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the elaboration of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A further randomized test in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that developing vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of COVID-19-specific animals, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to handle live viruses, and an international coordination to ensure procedural safety.
SARS and MERS vaccines have already been tested on non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vetorized vaccines, two with adenovir vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one ve.
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of the Coronavirus such as the Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have already been cured. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through drops produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces instead of remaining infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before the symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for mask use by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use, and others oblige use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty staying awake, bluish face or lips.
Less common, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop the symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking aloud releases more drops than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people's rooms contained positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the faeces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, a person usually infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of acute respiratory diseases cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in the alveolar cells of type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spice" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is most common in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and infiltrated inflammatory lining.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for airway epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported in necropsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrhal sample can be used.
The results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown that their accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the onset of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
ADHD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands without washing.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a scar when coughing or spitting, as well as covering your mouth with the inner side of your elbow if the scarf is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective drug for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve buying".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after sneezing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptics with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not “an active substance for asepsis of the hands.”
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated through palliative care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under review.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. physicians and pneumologists have compiled treatment recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation, are being carried out.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with airborne infection isolation (SIIA) in addition to taking the standard precautions, contact precautions and aerial precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, breather or face mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use breathers instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has approved the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against aerial particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-described uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the aerosol particles to spread, compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in elderly (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China noted that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high levels of PEEP are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High levels of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are being conducted with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral medication can be tested in people with various diseases.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests for potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of plasma of recovering people as treatment in cases where a person’s life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are required to report their name and ID number.
The application is able to detect the “near contact” using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data cell phone data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people Siewan and South they had contact with.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to reinforce quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
As early as March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect those who do not quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to circulate anyway.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rise in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the median manifestation of the initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lung show diffuse alveolar damage with exudates of cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The imaging examination of the lung looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality by comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-notification of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20-30% drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as probable, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, through infection by overcrowding.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date for the onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of the onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the emergency CID-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical diagnosis or epidemiological diagnosis within re-establishes the number of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall lethality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2240,191) on April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed to die of a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who die of a disease.
These statistics are not time-constrained and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was propagated by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths must have been formally registered as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% can have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed COVID-19 deaths.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for both men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only the 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mostly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is from "crown", "VI", "virus", "D", and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronaviruses".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal snails and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the required schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed from day to day.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with the most likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing candidates for the vaccine.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the speculative protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should have safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been more than 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs composes most Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report from the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and beta hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir by compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that double that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after having demonstrated low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial specula in preparation for serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytocin storm properties. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the completion of a small study.
A non-randomized phase 2 national-level test is underway in Italy, after having shown positive results in people with the serious disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome, T-cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
