I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Snoring is one of the five senses.
What do you have?

I'm not gonna sneeze.

Tell Tom about everything that's happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.

This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a sink in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jessie standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something very good has happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't mess with someone else's business.
Who's in the blue shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?

His house on the hill.
It was Sunday and I didn’t get up early.
How many lunches!
Mary, are you in the right shape now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 clicks.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tom a sip, threw a glass of wine through him, and a firm step out of the restaurant, a dead silence reigned.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom's gonna paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.

Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary last night.
I'm not afraid of him.
I am very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.

You taught me a lot.
What time do you wake up?
Get the trash out.

Tell Mary I've got her keys.
Did you buy candles?
Canada is the home of ice hockey.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They would have agreed.

So much has happened today.
I saw the car hit a man.

I'm not ready to do it yet.

I've seen it happen.
I don't think there can be any other reason than this.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was looted last week.
How can you always be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
A man is as old as he feels, and a woman is as old as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There was a lot of snow last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everyone seems to be happy.
Tom told Mary to tell her the truth.
You don't want another daughter?
I like to walk along the river.
You can come with me, all right?
This book is a great gift for us.
“How long before dinner?” – “Five minutes.”
Let her know.

That's when I hurt my hooligans.
I have nothing more to say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You're supposed to stay upstairs.
Come home sooner, Bill. Come on.
She was sitting in a chair reading a magazine.
From now on, it is forbidden to cry.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
This is the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the monkey.
Eat my chocolate? Don't even think!!!
Painted in white, the house seems more.
I had a hard time finding the original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing that?
Which dog is yours?
You should give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me that Tom spoke French.
Tom will be returning to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched the film in French with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was playing well.
He only blames others, and he never blames himself.
Do you know how to play banjo?

"When are you coming back?" - "It all depends on the weather."
How many turtles live?
How safe is it?

She said she'd be late.
Do your parents still live in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom is probably going to win.
What would you like Santa to bring to you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your adventurous spirit?
Why are you mad at me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit right there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged to my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman. You have to think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting in my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in a hat.
Put him on the shelf.
I thought you found someone else.
There are always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must have loved you.
It makes no sense to pretend that you make me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
In the end, he was sick.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom doesn't seem to know you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Leave it to yourself.
Do you read anything other than the Bible?
Read me the accountant's statement at the boiler.
What does this gentleman make of his life?
Why do you think Tom likes it?
Do your parents know about it?
Are they talking about you?
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoobe is not to express thoughts above the stomach and below the knees.
He paid him four bucks.
Because of the strike, I had to cancel my trip.
I don't know your name.
What time does the train arrive in Boston?
What words to this song?
Mary likes to irritate her brother.
The law is on my side.
So we had to find where to live.
Tom's been with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was scheduled for the professor's birthday.
Your phone called a couple of times while you were in the shower.
She went out for him because of the money.
Not every bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
It counts, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
It's your birthday soon.
Calculate.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom was married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I downloaded online.
I think Tom's under 30.
Have you been drinking?
It is undoubtedly best suited for this job.
You're making my job easier.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I'm loved.
You don't seem to be too busy.
Dedline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
You know those men out there?
Tom walked out of the room without saying a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished your lunch yet?
Tom and Mary had been talking for at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How many collars do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me about them in more detail.
Have you heard the latest rumors?
I'd show you how it's done.
I begged Tom to come.
He's got a badge on you.
My mom taught me not to waste money.
We could go on foot.
She died yesterday in the second half of the day.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took his place for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I yelled for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not gonna be late.
I'm terribly hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom takes care of the horses.
Why does Tom disagree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die when they are killed.
They disconnected Tom from the life-sustaining apparatus.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm sorry for my French.
What did I just do?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other everything.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom is twice as young as you.
Tom closed the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat, which can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you tell Tom first?

He wouldn't dare do that.
The 12-hour journey has bothered me.
The child woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who is the boss of this company?
No one saw how we did it.

We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know that Tom and Mary are engaged.
Eda!
Did you help Tom wash his windows?
It's out of my jurisdiction.
That was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm out of here.
Don’t tell Tom what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What are you gonna say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.

This soup gives the fish.
There are a lot of girls in the room.
He says too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to gain time.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among men, spoke in a terrible, from the point of view of the Jews, the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus showing the insufficiency of the claims of the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in prayer is close to God.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
Tom was paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.

There's nothing I can do to help Tom.
Is this my book?
Washing is a routine job.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must be missing him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's studying physics at Oxford.
He was hiding that fact from me.

You want me to help him?
Tom said he was going to Boston.
Are you sure your parents will let you go?
What is the minimum wage in Canada?

Do not pay attention to them.

I'm not as lucky as you are.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning to buy a house?
A cat on the table.
Tom says he doesn't want to go with me to Australia.
He came, he saw, he won.
Life is not always fair.
I saw Tom take your keys.
The whole night was ruined because of Tom and Mary's fight.
Can you read it?

Tell us more about your trip.

I don't expect you to believe that.

Sometimes a small gift can be a manifestation of great love.
Do you prefer a blonde or a brunette?
I didn't get on the bus.
That's why I didn't like this movie.
You want us to help you?
Be a realist.
Tom was planning to have a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us before?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Burn it.
I'm making progress.
You're as pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by six.
French is not that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was sad.
Tom's never been out of school.
I suggest you do it today.

Tom's drinking apple juice.
Will you take the train?
We think so too.
How could such a thing have happened?
You're an actress.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
I always have cold hands and feet.
How can I translate words that are not in any language other than my own?
Could you tie it with a tape?
I'll go home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.

I only washed my head once a week.
Eleven is a simple number.
I won't lie to you.
Coffee at my expense.
We're husband and wife.

Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where did you put the screwdriver?

Thank God!
You think Tom knows?
This time I'm crying.
Tom behaved like a child.
Stop singing. Stop singing.
There were only six people at the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do this right now.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I need to confess something.
I was expecting Tom to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign up.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"Do you speak Greek?" - "No, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How'd you get her?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We will try our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the depths of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He's here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
That's the cookie I made for you.
England is similar to Japan in many respects.
Tom would never have done that.
I suggest you try harder.
The dog does not scare the child.
Don't resist.
Tom has the keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the mountains to cheer up.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do what he wants.
Tom rarely tells us anecdotes.
Onions can be used in many dishes.
There is hardly any snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
A lightning strike hit the tree.
Do you speak English?
My brother's gonna kill me.
I opened the caliper.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Is Tom going with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You'll speak Swedish.
Have you ever seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the tube on.
Tell Tom he won't get caught in the eye.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting film.
I'm powerless. I work from morning to evening.
What time are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What will happen to Tom?
I hope you don't get cold.
He was targeting the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I need to move on.
She nodded her nose to the glass.
In English, the verbs ser and estar do not differ.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have an excellent English.
Do you have any messages for me?
Tom didn’t want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing an SMS while driving a car is very dangerous.
Tom said that Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wasn't going to win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many lunches do you have?
The villa was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom was the first to speak.
Did you ask Fomo to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to smother me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some of the birds didn’t fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
You were looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where can I wait for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught in a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we have to lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against desire.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered him a letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop smashing the fool!
Tom wants us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It is the largest car in the world.
Tom hardly ever asked me why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that Mary didn't do it that way.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred bucks.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You won't introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living in the city?
How long did it take you to do this?
We've finally got everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was yelling.
Which one's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at three-thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Get the animals out of the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George's five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you've been told.
Please take a look at this movie.
Somebody's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't love your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're way higher than Tom.
You can take advantage of his library.
I congratulated him on the birth of his son.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas shrugged from the door.
My father is an English teacher.
On Christmas Eve, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle.
Hold on to the rails.
Is that what you did?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
How many glasses on the table?
The lawyer has compelling evidence that she is innocent.
Possibly.
I don't like Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We've both seen him.
We have a duty to help.
Tom just got out of jail.
Did you tell Tom?
Me! Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to listen to your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can one use the evil circle in the evidence and get a high appreciation for it.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they just stared at me, and I never managed to get these bastards to understand their own language.
Should I leave?
I was so stupid that I believed it.
She really did it.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's been ten hours, and my mother must be mad.
The white bread, please.
Owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French is difficult, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must be missing her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris far away?
What time is it in Tokyo right now?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there will be snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would have done.
You won't have a second chance like that.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
I have to pay all the bills.
She's flattered.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom pulls Mary's hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the most lazy of the people I know.
Mary's already been in her room?
This time, I'll forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom was not a good coach.
He's a nuisance.
Alvaro from Venezuela. He's a Venezuelan.
That's it.
He publicly insulted me.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Magnets are used in induction plates for direct heating of the pot and the tile.
I was crying.
Tom wants to learn how to play the trombone.
Get out now.
Can I take a look at your rights?
I'll take 1000 pesetas with you to replace the zipper on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
That's how Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom's got a blast.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from the third half.
He likes it.
Tom knew Mary was unlucky.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This offer is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection got into the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday, you'll thank me.
I sometimes watch TV, though.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still having a bad time.
Run away, chicken!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock at night.
Mary didn't have any desire.
It was not as difficult to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say the film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was in a straw hat.
Take care of the little brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love the bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on a Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the Olympic Games of 1992.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know that Tom can draw.
They're stuck.
I didn’t know it would be impossible to do that.
You're having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you move her?
Does Tom speak French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn’t understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the newspaper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather permits, tomorrow we will go to the top of the mountain.
We're both familiar with him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes shimmered and shimmered, and his usually pale face revived and covered with redness.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were cut off from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it very carefully.
I find it difficult to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom's still living in Boston.
Let me pick up your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power is in Tom’s hands.
I learned to play and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not at all busy right now.
Children like to play more than learn.
He was considered his younger brother.
What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess which language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you ringing?
I don’t like people who talk about politics.
Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of fear.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm coming!
Do this until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom is not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
Did you suddenly get into fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to waste that much time.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's a pirate suit.
It's the pure truth!
Let's go get the yarn.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes that Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
That's why I had to invite Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
You're honorable?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and Universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is the one he pretends to be?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezubi, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I think Tom could have stayed longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
There's nothing wrong with it.
The last few days have been very hot.
He was wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she likes the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
Honestly, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases reach the court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve persons in the jury.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started to meet.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom has left Mary.
Tom realised that something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do it.
It's been another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was severely damaged.
He was hurt when he fell.
We are unbiased.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, come on, we're late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Do you keep an eye on your weight?
Tom's playing the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald’s is famous for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a very expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a gemstone.
Treat yourself to the liver, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to go with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Alice faced, awaiting an answer, was a sudden war. It was a roaring noise, so sharp that it would tear her drum-like whistles, and so loud that it would reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine's broken.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I was trying to solve the problem in vain.
You should've done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As it turns out, it will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look upwards at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey came down on a tree.
The language I am learning is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Couldn't you solve that?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There are 20 floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back, do you?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
Next month I will be very busy.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home in the evening?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as a donkey.
I think we can count on you.
She knew she wasn't right.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary was going to bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in a dream last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but a girl picked up the tube.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He was preparing for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested in that.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They are always complaining.
Tom's got a little bit of awkwardness.
You understand what she said?
You're kind of scattered.
Don't be mad at her.
I'd better stay.
That’s why I came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I'm refusing to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a reliable place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom's gonna have to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom stared in horror.
Tom's face was red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's a leftist.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
She's got leg pain.
This is a risk that we cannot afford.
Can you give me a minute, I want to talk about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is a square root of two?
Tom leaned forward, and kissed Mary.
Tom was floating?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do that.
I've seen Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, it's opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and went into the cave.

Her clothes caught a lot of attention at the party.
They're getting married tomorrow.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They were the ones who were the first to go.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Thankfully, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I like to spend time with friends.
I didn't know you were Canadian.
If you take the child out and point his finger at the moon, the child will look at the moon. If you do the same with the dog, she will look at your finger.
Tom had a beer.
Tom didn’t want to explain anything.
I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.
She was born on April 4, 1940.
There will be an economic crisis at the end of this year.
Don't let anyone in the fire.
You didn't know them, did you?
Tom showed Mary a letter he had received from John.
"The Psalms are boring," said the girl.
I want that, too.
Tom used to teach me french.
Where did Tom get that coat?
Don't forget to close the windows.
Could this be acceptable to you?
How will I get to work?
Tom says he'll fix it.
I suggest you put a seal here.
This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do it.
She has a very tense schedule.
Tom also speaks french.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
Tiger lilies bloomed in the garden.
I told her not to do that.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
We're here to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put the toys in a toy box.
I don't want you to drive.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, everyone's ignoring me." "Next!"
He has one goal in his life: to make money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
A letter to you.
Tom's grandfather couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she likes him.
Should I go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom spent the night at the hotel.
I explained it to her.
Tom's indecisive.
The nuclear baton!
I'll postpone my departure if it's raining.
Everything must be impeccable.
There's something else I want to talk to you about.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
That cuts my hearing.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
When the three main colors are mixed, it is black.
Settle down.
What time do you want to meet?
She doesn't like a new job.
I didn't want my neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
How long is Tom still in the hospital?
I want you to stay with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You have to respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I will pray earnestly.
What are you going to do if the war starts again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I’m not going to Australia this year.
The most famous gold fever is the California Gold Fever, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your photo.
I get to meet new people every day.
I want to go on a date with him.
You cheated on Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
I miss Tom so much.
He replied to his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him to the necklace.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot that today is April 1st.
Please, enough to sing this song!
Tom bit the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I am aware of the consequences.
To the east and west, the city is divided by a river.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks french?
Was Tom scared?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think it's Tom's fault.
I would love for you to stay.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice is heated, it melts.
We could've done it.
The doctor said Tom needed an operation.
I recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who knocks on my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I'm here to see you.
I feel like I'm amoeba.
Our team has returned home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom was married to an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why don't you sleep?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you're crying.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's quiet.
Let the dust settle.
Why are you so stubborn?
He went to his teacher of the Chinese language, but, with all these hormonal things, he went to almost every meeting.
I'm glad to inform you that I've recovered completely.
I've written many sentences in Esperanto.
I like the water more than the pastel.
I can't make exceptions.
He's quick to think.
I can find them.
I'm right here.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I have my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
You stole it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father loves fishing, just like I do.
Hey, it's me.
Dan has shown himself to be an advocate of white supremacy.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom cooks better than I do.
He swims like a tortoise.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy it.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, write it." - "I'm going!"
I have a big problem.
We are not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I got two tickets to the concert.
He likes to brag about his father’s successful automotive business.
She's wearing sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
A minus a minus a plus.
A body in the basement.
Please, make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to say.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech made us very sad.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look mind-boggling.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold his smile.
Wait, did you say "girlfriend" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning what you didn’t even know that you didn’t know.
Tom agrees to help Mary.
You should've thought about it before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he's not getting married to Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's fainted.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is a friend of my father's.
Can I come, too?
Is Tom earning enough to live in the city?
The interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He seemed unsure of his answers.
I've heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There are so many.
He could not follow the principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You'll probably be gone by three o'clock.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd be here sooner.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
Anyone can do that.
A single language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is endowed with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved this problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I didn’t have anything wrong in my mind.
Tom maintains cleanliness in his room.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's inside.
It's not cold today.
I accidentally wore Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank robbery was planned up to the minute.
He didn’t like it, but he bought it anyway.
Hold on a minute.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather great?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take the tube off.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say "no" to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't make me kill you!
Which one do you like better, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't piss us off.
You may not answer.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish an alligator from a crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take advantage of this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a kid.
You really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
I got a call from your teacher.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He is sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
Okay, everybody, listen up, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'm sorry.
I consider Tom my friend.
Counting to remain ignorant and free, the nation counts on what has never been and will never be.
Tom can barely breathe.
Dogs do not distinguish colors.
Tom poured the water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are true animals.
Tom’s house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Does Tom know you can't speak French?
There are two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It’s better to be alone than in bad company.
These are incorrect data.
There is a noticeable difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom's lazy.
I have to tell Tom not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come on, get closer.
We stayed at the Hilton Hotel.
So it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
There's something we need to do.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's working in her room.
Attention, everyone!
At that very moment, I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, right?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don’t do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have walked in the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom was asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are reusable.
Tom's never had a kiss with anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We complained to the manager about the noise from the neighbors.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As you meet the New Year, so you will spend it.
There is not a single book in the library in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially this one.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this in hiragana, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you the way I do.
Behave according to your age.
Do you know how to juggle?
You killed your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come over.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I do not tolerate the suffering of animals.
I think Tatoobe is slowing down today.
Sally forced her brother to clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of chaos.
The conference room is now busy.
Potato chips are bad for your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I’m looking forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's boring here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom about it.
Get the rope!
You've said it so often.
Tom says he's not hungry.
That's always been the case.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was put into orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure she's sick?
It's too simple.
What will happen to our children if there is a nuclear war?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I feel very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone else.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, don't you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill must be paid by the first of the following month.
My french is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted extortion.
I can't speak for a colleague.
Does Tom live far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The dispute ended with a fight.
I didn't take it. You can check the pockets.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to leave a comment.
You chose the wrong person.
They took a great risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was cancelled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a truck with mules on the road.
With his grandparents, Tom speaks French, and with his parents, he speaks English.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was not easy to find.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you don’t have the patience.
Several events marked the beginning of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he didn’t plan to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said it couldn’t be talked about.
He got out of bed.
The trains follow the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
He gave Layla his own computer.
Roll your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say that in America anyone can be president, but it’s probably not really the case.
Tom never forgot about Mary, though.
The first on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does the train arrive in Boston?
Haven't you seen that?
You need me to call.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John had been dating each other.
When I get rich, I buy a farm.
I baked cookies for him.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Translate this into French, please.
Take away the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was rapidly increasing.
Mary told me she loved me.
It was Tom who told me about what happened.
Hairy and beat it.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I am very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers with Tom's.
Tom has a weak heart.
That's why we're gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don’t even try to do it yourself.
No one's seen you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry! The test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don’t know which book to choose.
Tom didn’t understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's dressed in a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was a Sunday, not a Saturday.
Is anyone here familiar with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary is dressed in a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom's never asking anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's all right.
There are many wide streets in this city.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make people do that.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Do they sleep together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Neighbors complained to us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot the bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has flaws.
I wonder why Tom needs it.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Do you support me?
What do you not like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened the other night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom was not married to Mary.
The winter will soon be over.
The titles and awards don’t mean anything to me.
Where did you find him at all?
The meeting was delayed.
I'll get to know you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need the cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Gather!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we're gonna get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom seems optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I connect you with her.
She received the highest ratings.
Tom can get tough.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the open-air domicile.
I'd like to lie down.
You owe me notes or something like that.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight. I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
The cat's dead.
It's only half nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
Swimming in this lake is not safe.
I cut off my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put her hands on them to warm them up.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
My car's covered in pigeon shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I told her to marry him.
I've been waiting all my life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into the barn.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends for correspondence in Indonesia?
You might have to help her out.
Mary has lost her mind.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to a concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let’s talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
“Hello,” Tom said softly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack! Attack!
Look at the price list.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I've been somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new offer as a message in a bottle: it will one day be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She began to work in her new office.
Let us take care of that.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning to do it yesterday.
It's too early to drink alcohol, isn't it?
Parents don't like my way of dressing.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him cleverly and hardly.
Because what, worse?
It's inexpensive.
Can I take you by the hand?
It's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom hadn't slept all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
You need to start watching the series when all the seasons have been filmed!
Road accidents happen on a daily basis.
Where did you go to go skiing?
You were in the hairdresser's?
The outlook is daunting.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Disappear.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go and help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.
Will they come too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brakes.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shook the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged her.
That's my cat.
Do you already have children?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a self-righteous idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all panties.
Tom believes that throwing away food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place turns to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's been drinking whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you right now.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I was before.
You know that boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he would never do that.
The thief will also steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went out fishing.
He was just a shadow of his former self.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to go with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It's all happening.
What day is today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm an ordinary guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily's lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I have to stick together.
I've only heard good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare to us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me about Tom in more detail.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw away my Pleistocene.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm! Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank you from me to your son.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
It's your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to go to his house tonight.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer gave his men the courage.
Tom's never gonna find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying similar things right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is the first time I have cooked grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.

The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you? Who sent you?
She tied a sweater to him.

You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.

I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing this or not.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come for his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.

I was going out when I called.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to the obstacle to the right.

I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
Maybe she's pretty, but I don't like her.
I can kick you if you want.

Why didn't you get out of your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.

It is your own fault that this happened.
It's just like a clock.
I know where you're going.
You're catching everything on the fly.
Let's do it.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.

I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.
I don’t know if there is a country in the world where you can marry your dog.

Tell them to go home.
Yeah, put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
