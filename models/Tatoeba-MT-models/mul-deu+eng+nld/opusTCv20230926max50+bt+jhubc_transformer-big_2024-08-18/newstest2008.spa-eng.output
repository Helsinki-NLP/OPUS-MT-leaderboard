European inflation slid into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying rise in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Union Statistical Office based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, under the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and a reduction in forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: “we have to negotiate” on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue afterwards.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the 12-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation rose in the euro area as a result of galopant food and energy prices.
Wheat prices have risen by 88 percent, and soybean prices have reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold last month almost $100 a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent for the next 3 or 4 months, however, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during the year 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup had never before experienced such a low – 13 percent – in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of party-safe voters – due to the greater firmness of opposition voters – would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) versus support of a fifth for socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary scaffolding: their support within the entire population is one to two percent.
Among the safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low – it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who judged the country’s economic situation particularly poor, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for the coming year, the majority of the population is deteriorating and only a tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, which is higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of the Government was more likely to discredit his functions than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or greatly trust Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, currently this ratio is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the participation question answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By comparison, only 55 percent of the population would participate in "general elections to be held this Sunday" and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of tuition fees, 79 percent would disapprove of medical consultation services and 84 percent would disapprove of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among safe referendum participants, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has doubled its prices
The average price level increase of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of the gold trading triangle of Budaörs, with the difference that this year the VAT has not been increased.
Article of Napi Ezaz<0xC3><0xA1>g
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the gold trading triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth of much more than 1,000 HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already “fired” in December last year, so there was no dramatic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do it even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we also found one kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with two-liter removable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan up by about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket values with this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average growth of prices was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in prices was felt the increase in VAT.
Precisely this process was the one that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to make decisions about the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, it can lose a significant profit on the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic price growth was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of primary consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some essential foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month interval.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only a 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, which can impose a drastic rise in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets don’t complain about the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most consumers of the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products buy large quantities, taking the canned food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, in the three stores large queues were formed in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, hospitals have recorded several thousand infections caused primarily by the misapplication of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overloading of staff do not favor infection control, says the National Center for Epidemiology’s chief medical officer.
In many hospitals it saves even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an infection with MRSA was diagnosed in the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
An injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then no major surgery has been performed due to the presence of the bacterium in his body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multi-resistance agents has certainly been recorded, the rest is not known.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is overly or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, turn into bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and quickly become infected under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicaemia in the first place, to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with weakened organism, to the elderly or to people of light weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the Hospital J<0xC3><0xA1>nos there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, the nursing staff takes care of them in rubber gloves and masks and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are examined in advance to check for the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections from MRSA in most cases, but the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of formation and infection with multi-resistant pathogens – says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not fashionable.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come out to the public when already visible MRSA infections occur in the patient - said the doctor-department-head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes stringent commitments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological pictures.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed to prevent drug resistance from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is contagious from one patient to another through healthcare professionals.
Therefore, the washing of hands, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this sense considerable defects are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is contagious through drip transmission and direct contact between people, however, in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher probability of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where the appropriate preventive measures are followed, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is being fought in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholism of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the District XXII Police Commander has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a state of shock the then-retired commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday crashed and caused the death of a passerby, Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Prosecutor General's Office of the Capital, reported on Friday, after preparing the pericial report.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholism that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the district XXII police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle on bending to Kossuth Lajos street in the XXII district, attacked a 55-year-old man who was intending to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian zone.
(The latter fact, that is, the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always cede the pass when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is under the responsibility of the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out from the subsidy of the Cohesion Funds, of which the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million had previously been signed by the parties to a loan contract of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan contract is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this objective by Hungary, the decision on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be taken later, by extending the loan contract.
The parties signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the funding of the Metro, they will reconsider the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a commission for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buys in the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly increase?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments from the ski slopes and the beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
The capital Sofia can also be attractive, as commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, so it can be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100,000 euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category is the buyers of cottages (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital property is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The rise in the price of real estate considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the Six Hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the minister-level negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Roadmap for post-emission reduction efforts set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particular issue between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures for the time being, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference was whether the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, were willing or not to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need.
In addition, an agreement was reached on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The support fund, envisaged in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six Percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its gas emissions by 20 percent from the 1990 level, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to its capacity to decrease its development by as much as 30 percent, and is also willing to commit to its capacity to reduce its capacity to even 30 percent if the other large developed regions see disparities in the world and countries.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a 5.2 percent decrease, within which the then 15 EU Member States committed to comply with an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emissions of greenhouse gases in relation to the period between 1985 and 1987, which our country will comply with – notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is much that is at stake in Bali, since in two years time the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be followed by the change.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and could not prevent an increase of more than 2<0xC2><0xB0>C above the Earth’s average temperature, which scientists believe would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of the services of YouTube: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operating body, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded to the Internet in this way and their “channel” has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own.
Category: Operations in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the Defense Ministry’s opinion they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army’s presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional recruiting television spots - defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the frenetically edited and censored recordings, in the distributor also appear amateur videos, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official", a little hypocritical propaganda films, the officers talk at most of losses, but do not present the bloody part of the fight.
In addition, numerous videos from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the Internet already recorded in real operations, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different way of recruiting with free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salted pastel at the Christmas feast of ministries
Work Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 with salted pastry and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a towel and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you can enjoy the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defense, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, and for the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad will be invited, and a reception for the press will be offered.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the festive atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Agency for Development (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of HUF 4,320,000 and the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty of the six hundred workers of the ministry is expected.
At the portfolio party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The ANF Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have failed to communicate with the competent person.
Can be assisted without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Luc<0xC3><0xAD>a Day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party started with the minister’s greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering the question of [origin] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or dress at night.
Health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in their own building with a budget of HUF 400,000.
Instead, Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a working meeting at the end of the year.
The participation of one hundred and eighty guests - as reported by the press department - will take only coffee and salted pastry, so the party will not cost more than HUF 350 000.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai instead will simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own event hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with a buffet and a toast.
Since J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of its celebration.
The agricultural portfolio will offer a New Year’s reception on January 20, in the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception on foot, to which will be invited only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and end with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas celebrations – this is what the relevant press departments have communicated to you [origin].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry ' s Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held in the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together.
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will set up a strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s indefinite strike.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - unemployment will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway transit will be stopped completely and by 1 p.m. workers of the Budapest Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League trade unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which they will hold together with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Union of Engineers will also be set up to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while the participating trade unions will be on indefinite strike on Monday, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call to strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly it is also possible to vote only on the law of public health in the very early hours of the night, or preferably near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning a part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the companies Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n may stop.
At the same time, at many points in the country there will be closure of half of the roads.
Numerous civil unions and organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others indefinitely.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railways and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were not able to reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are travelling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 13 hours will be on strike the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike the Trade Unions of LIGA of the Electric Industry 2 and Sindutos of Sindutos of Sindutos of Sindutos of the Electric Industry, and Eg<0xC3><0xAD>a of Eg<0xC3><0xAD>a.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will be on national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) that are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advance pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the rail sidelines and expect another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country increases the risk by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company's "risk warning" reads: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They claimed that all this was due to one of the main flaws of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and gypsies."
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the stability and democratic development of the country."
We are reminded that since the fall of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been increasingly publicized and promoted and that since the summer of 2007, numerous self-defense associations have been established in the country.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, public order defense), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e., of the state."
They asserted that all this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
The emphasis on the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but at the same time is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, in numerous neighbouring states, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar manner to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to form the guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, director of research at Political Capital, told the news agency that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their risk warning.
The party is not always written with red numbers.
In Hungary the law accurately defines the days that are written in red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - which the next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America, the holidays are not unified.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and public holidays.
Holidays are primarily related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
Let us celebrate the New Year as well: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven festivities written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on 23 October, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st the Labor Day, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day festivals of the Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, which is why you often bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for such extended weekends, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the party.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not obligatory on the other hand for companies and service institutions that, because of their function, work uninterruptedly even during public holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, as according to the experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with mid- or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the work party will be modified so that workers can rest for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that in return Friday, May 2, will be a public holiday.
The other change relates to the feast of October 23: Saturday, October 18, will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
Instead, the year that comes during the end of the year party can be rested, since from 24 December there will be hardly any work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to bitteren the life of your colleagues
Emails we forget to send, sound messages we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us unnoticed: they are all part of our everyday Folklore at work.
It is up to you to decide whether to adapt to the small inconveniences or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to let you know that you've been searched by the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, you feel sorry and try to fix the issue, it’s best to call the marketing department to tell them that they forgot to hand you the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to blunt explanations, it is worth meditating on the things that you can bitteren the life of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you want to pick up a document, an office utility, or your phone and you can’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your missing pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without asking them, because rightly they will be angry with you for taking away their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Are you joking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t give everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the private life of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard, and don’t joke about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unnecessarily?
When you call the office on the phone and say you’re sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel sick or well, you feel like that day you prefer to rest; think about what others should do your job, your unencumberable tasks, your work by term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you know in advance that you will not go to the office the next day or something may happen to you, so you will have to stay at home, communicate with them, so that your colleagues or your boss will not have to confront you the next day.
Tarareos, risitis, phone calls
Are you stuck in your job, but are you abruptly ridiculed by your colleagues?
Have you inadvertently heard a phone call that would have been better if you hadn’t listened to it?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your tarareos, singing, conversations out loud (less when you do them above their head), gossip, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message!
Do not allude to the chaos that may eventually reign in the office, nor to the noise that your colleagues make!
You must acknowledge if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the defect!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t watch a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows!
Don’t be uneasy, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so requires!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
It sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays Zagar's song Wings of Love.
National music life didn’t hurt us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it seems totally different this blockade when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some interesting new songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although the garage rock style is again fashionable, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to triumph, when he was asked for [b4]cinematographic soundtracks (e.g.
Francis in the Turkish Season.
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially only performed in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national records, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to sell itself also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked them if they are wearing this label or not.
The ensemble reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released record, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
It is well referenced on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds the loudest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi channel that recently broadcasts popular music from the morning to the evening. This broadcaster brought to the ears of the radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked the Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: the one you are playing, to what extent is music dedicated to a select audience?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two kinds of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-old generations attend concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they come from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We don’t compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, rely on each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that our works compare to the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we embarked on another path.
hvg.hu: In the mr2 hits list Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard the name Zagar for the first time in relation to this song.
Have you consciously opened up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to compose big hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly that way or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the record, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came almost to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it would not have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and not louder than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are at the bottom just because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says about it, about that we forget for a while our ego, who has come from and where it is going, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you do the most?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little everything was put in its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "released" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A traitorous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal villain.
This is what Jerome Kerviel, the French banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, points out.
For him, he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good abilities.
It was long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard by his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses according to what the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said.
Precisely in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw her come at the beginning of the year.
In February they began to hear some news about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, his earnings exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I won my first 500 million I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel confesses, adding that nothing has been left for him at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had forged the records in such a way that they would not be discovered.
He even tricked the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk turned into a benefit
Were you afraid that it would be discovered?
No, no, no.
"I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy."
Where did you get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
Its annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005 I already noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million title.
And this meant a boot mechanism, and it wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or that they rather suspected it.
"As he made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of its fault.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
Ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed with representatives of the European Commission yesterday a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can achieve 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kronor).
This represents almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Out of seven operational programmes, approximately CZK 125 billion will be spent on the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transportation, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kroner.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Businesses should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly-entered countries that use them the least.
20-Year Penalty for Former Nicaraguan President, Court Orders
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday imposed a 20-year sentence on former President Arnaldo Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 of a misdemeanor of $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to be house arrest at his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Nothing is clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back in the grid.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend more on the penitentiary agents if they let German finish his sentence at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Germans were constantly transferring government money to a company’s account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to their closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from various debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, passed the new law quietly.
It's a big paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and departure from the budget, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but within it lies the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore special attention is paid to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social-Democrat governments suffered from three flaws that cannot be solved so easily by this year 2008:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as the expenses of the trustees that are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second of these is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The watchmaking pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, fees and credits of the banks, often issued, meaningless, obligations with which they disproportionately owed to their councils.
In recent years they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that they received from the state and from privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we adhere only to official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which boasts <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to place order on state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We belong to the nations that, within the framework of global measures, are least threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have been inflated in the last few years with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform then will really be the end of any politics in this country and, government that governs will only be a mere bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern will turn into civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the money from pension taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget can’t be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure from normal spending on the spending of the mandates.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted in the last ten years what it could have done.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining from taxes and fees, peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders in the Monetary Mark.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to customers.
“This coordinated action by the central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must be really afraid of what awaits them yet when they decided to take this step,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems with access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the global economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks constantly feared lending money even when the Central Banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move by the central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists’ Debates Are Incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the conclusion of the UN’s international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I only find myself with the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters, and that the attempts to influence the development of the climate are ine.
Moreover, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against “reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.”
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can request the change so that officials have until the end of the year to issue the new carnet.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year there will be hundreds of thousands of drivers on the roads without a valid driver’s license.
According to traffic, the carnage has not changed mainly those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the towns they announce a rapid decline in the change of carnets, the metropolis offices are full of applications and interest in the new carnet has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 daily customers.
A half hour is expected in the queues.
In Prague, the new carnage has not yet been taken out of about 140,000 drivers.
The issuance of a new carnet lasts 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the carnet within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are required to change their license plate and do not reach the end of the year, but will be on the road without a valid license plate, will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the offence with a warning.
In the event of an administrative violation, the fine will amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the above information, the person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderate fines of a maximum of one thousand kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the carnets issued during 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the carnet that was issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplices detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as final expiry the reduction of the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the Prague department against organized crime were to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, only by the Supreme Court’s revocation.
Berdych is also accused in this case but he is awaiting first the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years in other cases.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the robbery, and helped criminal group members avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Kona<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
In terms of theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a gun permit.
In the home registry, police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser conductor and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly a dozen men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still reporting from other processes, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they are awaiting a final decision on their handover to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing a few children: 12 million
For changing some children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, disagrees in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
“We don’t approve of such a demand, it’s too high,” Dostal said after today’s meeting.
“In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescission value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>'s family wanted, for each month they didn't raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was best tolerated by men although they struggled with recriminations for changing the girls.
Women are worse off with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were switched by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> maternity home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola and <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xBD> and P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Ver<0xC3><0xB3>nica and Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Governor Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed over 100,000 crowns to each family in late October as compensation for the mistake made at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors, they must withdraw from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask for help from the administrator.
To date, the court has recognized a proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in the hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the suit over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not presented to the public today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone comes with the image of the actor and comedian.
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve had about 10 years of work.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
“After years I realized that the project is successful and that for that reason I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> had to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the society Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of her name and signature on passports and even offered her owners discounts to visitors to her farm and attendees to her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also determined today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among the today decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka the official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
From that moment on conflicts began to take place between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, was derived from the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, as the mother queen.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society which has to date been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is already preparing.
The new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We have no rush.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a particular date.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can introduce himself," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Overcome Prejudices
I have never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is a successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headroom space in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi’s body means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters long.
Flying around the world
I go inside quickly so I don’t repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the design invention although already the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned lack of space in the header disappears.
Bags in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This should be appreciated as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear gate) and a well-distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that provide an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the depot.
According to the tables, in basic regime has a capacity of 428 liters, which in comparison to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the same type of vehicle best-selling in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot is behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or by placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I should quote the floor that remains quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four strokes
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that's what a 1600 should look like that would underestimate the family five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the damage then that looked like the exhaust pipe was covered with a cloth, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices are responding
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with 1400 injection ignition for 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield cleaner, automated rear windows...
In other words, the car with everything costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons in the Fabia and it’ll get to a pretty similar number.
It is now up to you to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and as a result, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between migrants and native children are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronchitis among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking sticks to a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls cheered him on with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to let go, he gave us the urge to throw us apples and pears, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European emigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and all included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean island you can find all this and much more.
Only on an island you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He ordered him to build one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything there was of crime in the United States (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, along wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the show world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you can mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already in the cult of the 1950s, still operate in Havana today, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Although Havana, especially the old quarter is deteriorating markedly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money needed, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow routes in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades were not discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist elsewhere in the world can only be found in museums.
Where to go?
The best-known place for most visitors does not change.
And for that, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone lands.
Mosquitoes, limestone piles and high cliffs in the valley falls, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rock valleys are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting any of the purée habaneras factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone would find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Mayor Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad
Old Abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has barely changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road to connect it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and, therefore, nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth seeing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancon Beach or the sugar mill valley.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which inspires with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the road itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in fact it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, puros, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patroness of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Copper, the Santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, of which many pages could be filled.
However, as they say, it is better to see it ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up activity, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and the allocation of development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is tangible but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own,” Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
The Ninety Percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to the US military is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the Allies have reached the same limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly require more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in heaven in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months there is a controversy about whether allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands to fight there are not as high as ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper this week called the German soldiers vague.
“Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting,” Sun wrote in a post accompanying photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photo where the British troops were playing a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt to Reach Billion in 2009
For each Czech, the state owes 84,000 kroner.
The total debt amounted to SEK 842.7 billion in September.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew at the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
Since June, however, it has dropped 13.4 billion kroner.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt at the beginning of October.
For each Czech, the debt is 84,000 kroner.
For the whole of the past year, the state owed more than 111 million kroner.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the border of the trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion kroner,” Patria Finance economist David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance economist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora said: “We could pass the billiards during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see that change," he added.
The Doubt Grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The debt of the state is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or e.g. loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z kroner since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The year-on-year total debt from the first to third quarter creation is 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Picora said.
Better than expected
From the government’s payment and debt management strategy for 2007, it is drawn that the government planned this year to borrow 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, the ministry lowered the plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million kroner instead of the projected 91.3 billion kroner.
The rest consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with around 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for pension payments, 43 billion kroner to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion kroner in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
He was comparing today in court in Jart<0xC3><0xBA>m for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting 6- to 7-year-olds give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when all representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was subject to a penalty of beatings.
This 54-year-old British schoolteacher, based at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, has been arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of her students to the minister.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a professor at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "sorry that he only asked children to vote for a name ", it is only an "innocent mistake " according to him.
A divided opinion by many pupils of the school teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils" and "never talking about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
For example, can we give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Serbians and Kosovo Albanians ended a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their disagreements on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not anticipate violence for now, but we are entering a very difficult period " , he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the West considers independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the hotel in Baden, where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given some of his sorrows.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a compromise to be always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia " , said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made " in consultation with the West " .
Bush Settles Agreement Between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced during the opening of the international peace conference he convened in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old litigation point between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do anything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle " the terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties to their obligations regarding the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This designation covers the three main pelvic problems of the point of dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that forthcoming negotiations be “global and deepened” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things”.
As he climbed back into the stands, Olmert committed to what the upcoming negotiations are “direct and ongoing” and to making “an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008”.
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of his " two-state vision " for Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to this on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” Saudi Prince Saud said in an interview with Saudi Arabian capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, last Sunday?
Just as every time in this kind of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police Inspector General (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," a police source explained.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "not approved, or not authorized to ride on public roads " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was "all gas ".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the ceding the step to the right," police said.
The alcohol control exercised on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front of the car, the windshields cracked, the bumpers kicked off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary murder and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, co-chaired with the departmental direction of public safety of Val-d 'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly to their left".
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by rubbing footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to come to a brake.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing assistance to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside " any serious deficiencies " in this regard.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, on which we have to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that looks exactly at the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely helpless policeman, who was stabbed.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly encircled the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the rescuers arrived "about twenty minutes after the police march".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not allow it to be assumed that the police services did not bring assistance to the youth.
These young people have been helped.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police cracked down on Monday on the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyer movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president " urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste they swore to in front of Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled"
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
In the coming days, he had to decide on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in the presidential election, on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president " does not value more" after the state of emergency was established, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denounced persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the army.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancy (36%) is unplanned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law voted to liberalize contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unexpected births.
Different contraceptive methods such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "dominance of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of every ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours of space work to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "captured" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of hosting soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing path for the modules-laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began reorganizing the module’s solar panels with a 76-meter range.
And that's where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in just over a meter by a wire that was jammed.
Deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30-meter long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
High, sturdy, very skilled, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker " who had stayed close to the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an insulator-wrapped mini-hockey stick to prevent electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "bounced" by the astronauts on board the station.
Upon completion of the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it had to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditioned the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to mitigate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the parent company of European manufacturer EADS said.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that EADS’s operating result failed by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another program, that of the very thick A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, after the ballot: the Russians are going to massively opt for President Putin’s party, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a televised message to voters today about public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory turns out to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not allow anything to be transparent by welcoming foreign ambassadors, content with delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling – his subject of preference during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we wish honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign smeared by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been such a dirty election, even in the time of Yeltsin.
After the repression of last weekend’s demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, is banned, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in both legislative and presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they don’t feel like owners of their destiny,” said Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has been followed not by terrorism, but by a certain economic outpouring," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " relinquish the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why to reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New liberties imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory.
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, describing the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open access.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were thus far not available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or her right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of the forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the public opening of these nomination documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find deported or forced laborers and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already amounts to about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said.
The European Union's Foreign Ministers had last April given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free-trade pact will dope a lot on both economies” and “India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million thriving Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second possible European market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner pointed out. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", he had declared this week to Europe.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about relieving the current round of credit concerns, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid at the base rate of 5.75 percent in five weeks, an unusually long offer.
"To alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to announce a significant proportion of its stockpile reported during a week " in a trading session scheduled during the holding period.
The bank states that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the Bank of England BoE is putting on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take further steps to maintain the rates " of interbank loans on a daily basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank index was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny consideration of PS party’s propositions on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles on the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "nice" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, among which the increase of 50% of the surplus salary for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products) and the restrictions on floating, a check-transports.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes alive, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS deputies leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn’s Festival Republic.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who has inspired, no more and no less, the current movement of festivals in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival will take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival at Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as “the most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we’re stuck in low-category policies because of the current administration,” Charlie Jones said.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional venue that has recently taken place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after breaking out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are performed rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of country festival in the European and urban way in the American way.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is “very big,” such as that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been released to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal to face Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where you’re going.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are going to judge the best,” he says.
The Race to the Festivals
For the time being, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
All West Coast festivals, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and make sure the directors do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to say goodbye to the end of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based solely on statistics, especially because in the current context, uncertainties lie in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not in favour of the stock market taking to the lane in the last few weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values both in the long run and in the long run."
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral, not volatility-free behavior "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture into saying there will be a rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joys,” says the expert.
Ibex has lost close to 4% from its peaks on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert tints that things will be a little different this year as he believes the rally will advance to the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound in the index that could be driven depending on the news coming from the US in terms of the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
Analysts are confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values that will be in charge of bringing Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year is about big values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, says that the increases will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, if given.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will be a major factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bassist month on just two occasions.
The real year-end rally was lived in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the pinch of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a 6.68% rebound.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (currently Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 8:30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening one afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to point out or not to this initiative that follows the trading schedules.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capturing private customers moving through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a larger hiring, since it goes from about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular counts today with 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these locations of PopularMax will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value of his rival Antena 3 in the stock market for the first time
We've done it.
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect spoiled his joy: ‘It’s what hurts me, it’s not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve gone down less,’ he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, ‘we’ve fallen less.’
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain places its loss in what we have for the year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulates a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this data were to become real, the TV channel would see this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to the 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million) while television’s net revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
“We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, who we have already valued with 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market is now showing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and by 7% in 2009.
The projected revenue growth has been reduced from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s earnings forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on November 1
In parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of the amendments incorporated in the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the entities so that markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and to natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services firms to disclose on the market information about key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform, to facilitate supervision by CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Committee on Economics, several amendments were incorporated, including highlighting that securitised debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given their high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the US high-risk mortgage debt.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that can be performed by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the Royal Decree that delimits professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and can provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI rises five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and minister of economy, Pedro Solbes, has said the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has augmented that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the hallways of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential from the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
“We expected a figure of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12.bn (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8bn) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, he had accumulated a record deposit of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the government and that will continue until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues from British banks that will be deposited over the next three years to achieve those remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the 30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana detained for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the People’s Party) today early in the morning for his alleged connection to the plot of urban corruption this week.
In addition, one of the Consistory’s secretaries and the municipal police chief have also been arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, the current MP, and until then head of the municipality, and that according to sources of the research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Officers continue to register municipal dependencies and the city council and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lettering of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption unleashed earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore outlawed, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to the sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to head the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the president of the government and secretary general of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE Organization Secretary José Blanco and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he pointed out that “it looks like” that the Manchester politician will be the Socialist group’s candidate to preside over Congress if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who made public last November 15th his decision not to appear in the upcoming general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political avant-garde since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an “act of transparency.”
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or screaming” and make “it look more and more like the citizens.”
“Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk calmly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times.”
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good deed" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
climatic propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to unmerciful persecution both to the skeptics of its predictions and to those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show an iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that that fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach compels him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain’s leading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why its government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with maximum clarity to the Spaniards what measures you will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and will be no such explanations.
Precisely because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening accounts for businesses and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequences.
With shocking sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
Whenever you limit yourself to being a purely virtual contracting party and don’t want us to ride a bike or refresh ourselves with the banner.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today.
The edile was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose branches he is currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also gone to the City Hall and the municipal Soil and Housing management company.
These three arrests add to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land into urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is directed by Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees have been brought to justice today.
According to sources, the former governor of Totana and now the PP’s autonomous parliamentarian, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former governor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Sole de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, through which bribes would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
Grupo Nuaria was in charge of developing the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigoes car parks in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion and sale of the facility.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us this comment yesterday in Finland’s most important newspaper (for instance at the head of the PISA report on education level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that Black’s critique of the book appeared, curiously:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped into public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the Educational Counselor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of offences on Internet downloads:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
Instead, if you steal in the store records worth less than 400 euros, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the imposition on discharge (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the unloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to engage in a fight than to engage in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous riot has a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorised films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is going hand in hand, a very long hand.

My GP tells me one of his rare research articles titled, “Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.”
That is, that the feelings generated by the workers’ monthly salary depend on what the peers earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the Imaging Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when both were right they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly chasing war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter sweet taste, because the main culprits for the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
His names are on that list that takes its title from the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schöpbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain), which, with the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and press the shutdown of governments.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible injuries, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the carnival, the civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the carnival, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of failure.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the carnival, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on the statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to pay.
That is why both women and women over the age of 25 have to pay lower premiums, as the statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of accidents due to their prudence.
Also, by using the counts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of parcel.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
It is for this reason that the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various drawbacks when it comes to hiring affordable insurance, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the carnival.
Although the ideal to be well insured is full risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk franchise, so they get insurance coverage at all-risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would imply that the customer pays a portion of the amount of the sinister.
“The part of the amount of the sinister that the customer contributes will be preset based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount,” explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s top manager of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid injuries as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, potentially reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base fee.
The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After 25 years, it is easier for drivers to hire insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire a full risk with franchise.
“Usually, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of being involved in an accident, and even at the time of driving,” says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘novice fear’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as your financial situation allows it, of course.
Marriages with children, on the other hand, are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of insolvency, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with a deductible (may be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry on a more relaxed drive and have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a greater amount of franchise,” said Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it is advisable to have a full-risk insurance with a deductible (this being 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible damage, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic in Milan is looking for a point that is worth the eighth.
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the 'Champions' league, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their qualification.
The Italians add ten points and already on the fifth day certified their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives the Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the entire sixth day ends, as Milan have to compete in the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the 16th final.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would stay first and ensure a better crossover in octaves.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because the nine-point pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other live match.
So the Milanists will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are confident of getting into eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a Kaka goal in the prolongation (1-0) after the 0-0 draw.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the victory, in case he loses the Celtic, both to enter the eighth and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and with no options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since disbanding in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver.
About 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that included a video telling the story of the band that made the furore in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went out on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd crowded at GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
Victoria Beckham said the British star "hasn't seen our outfit, for any reason, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the disintegration of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Among the five are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that it will affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every rush between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the gas monopoly owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge more to Ukraine, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be Ukraine paying 40% more for Gazprom imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Soviet nations.
NHS “should test foreign workers”
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records of employees outside of Europe, a vigilante said.
The recommendation from Auditor General Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was found to be related to the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign personnel it has.
However, his report pointed out other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed at the gates of the airport’s terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS hopes to conduct pre-employment checks on applicants, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish health board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The Auditor General’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should rely on the Criminal Records Bureau’s guidance, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside the UK.
“Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign personnel."
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it’s not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say there are currently 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor-general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely followed.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreign nationals’ pre-employment policy and guidance at the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was of great interest that this work would be carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-protagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond protagonist Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until her suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film – in black and white – featuring a soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was produced for just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic U2 Joshua Tree album, won two awards – Best Director and Best Debut Director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony—such as Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, which won the award for Best Documentary.
The award for best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a head of the Russian mafia in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Glass Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The festival's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks against religious and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have campaigned against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the report said.
Saudi Arabia has created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned entry by smuggling eight missiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining al-Qaeda as militants to fight allied forces and back the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heresy by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted government-associated alien residences, government buildings, and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The detainees also include a 16-person “media cell” in Medina, whose objective was to promote “the takfiri thought” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes another 32 people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin Earth than had been previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by stormy winds and lightning storms.
The European Space Agency’s results for the Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a panorama of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the weather.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “It is being clarified why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when there are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police say "enriched uranium"
One kilogram of radioactive material, which they say is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It's still open
Mitt Romney says it’s not worthy that presidential candidates answer a snowman’s questions.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary and current voters record video questions and send them for their dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the Republican party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in the face of next year’s election.
It’s not exactly known how CNN’s producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to dial up when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noted peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regulate their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the issue.
None have the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because both alerted on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with China’s fear of toxic toys and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned into awkward when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now against all expectations, first in Iowa’s most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is growing in Iowa, coincidentally with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out of the background, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laborist
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucks.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party, worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using fake names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and judgemental poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative flaw.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it is the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t improve things, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is over: public officials start to fail; cabinet ministers get exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets on the defensive and doesn’t focus.
In one part, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Although I wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax, are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the mistake.
And even if it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “cash for partners,” political party funding research — voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for large political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr Watt, who said he knew of Mr Abraham's agreement, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest he knew about these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, an investigative commission on the matter – conducted largely by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one in six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard co-operative work by the Labours with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the trade unions – bitter measures for a partyist like Mr. Brown.
But he has to deal with some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and strong competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the mortgage crisis subprime infecting the American credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s natural for some dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million in its U.S. consumer financing business, in part due to the weakness of cardholders.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, the third quarter’s crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. People’s Bankruptcy Act (2005) led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss of credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of delay) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions by 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flows than asset values, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They may even work to advance the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt rises to the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retracement.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those back fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility in the fraud with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colliding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were brought to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were that they had alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s fall.
The indictment against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of Enron frauds, which helped its spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three British knew it would value at an upward rate.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s $1 million bank interest.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of tricks in accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failed businesses look successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron’s founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were in charge of the board last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when she died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of Gulfstream’s cabin last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract rich new Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany crafted yachts to diamond-inlaid car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to him."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Providing fuel for the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s largest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow — and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attended the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the group Soho Jewelry.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very dignified.”
On Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who re-released the design suit he used as a network carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cortaplums, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a Dutch royal porcelain stand Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said the richest Russians of more trajectory (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people – cash millionaires, millionaires’ envoys or tourists – fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies custom luxury cars, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grilles for Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” Mr. Karapetian says.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if you’re not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with stacks of fake $1 million banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of million.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
"Chuckles" Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw an ambulance climbing White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared on the scene.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance come up,” said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That's when I found out someone was dead."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, but they are awaiting the toxicology test, although the results will not be available until a few weeks, to help resolve the mysterious death she has apologised to the top ranks of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the County Union's attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine if Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 P.M.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a pinkish marshmallow is located in the front of the house, and a dalmata licks at the back.
A blue drum labeled as "vinyl ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - was at the door of the caravan, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rude political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut fees to raise the Stock Exchange
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were boosted by the reassuring comments of the U.S. central bank vice president.
The exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, Ben Bernanke's number two president, declared policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued tensions in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing sample credit exchanges, Mr Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October.”
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at closing to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at closing to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit tension in the markets was highlighted after strong demand at a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the London stock markets, strained credit and three-month "Libor" loans rates among British banks, marking the biggest rise since September, from a 12.59%, after a steady rise.
England sues Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here there are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection that is on loan- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and furthermore because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill in one's time, if select part, in national, to become offers.
He who does not get the sixth place will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless they give him a chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain’s eye at the same time taking a “wicket” and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to have an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first try even if Stephen Harmison declares himself to "fit and bowl" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more from these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred doubles against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of the early 88s in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two rounds in May against West Indians in the Test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of élan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living in swords.
He gets caught up in the cricket field for nothing and his attitude was summed up as when he flipped his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at the distance, to tell him excitedly, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slip pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah doesn’t stand out, as tea leaves suggest, he’s the one playing here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – And Fighting Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who were expecting the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it’s safe now.”
“They say Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious activist Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease fighting.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and Sunni teacher in the Amariyah area, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped bring Al Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s new arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues.”
“That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they have been drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops consolidated groups of armed “citizens” working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned for visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis to force them back into Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tensions.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will re-emerge sectarian tensions and start the fight.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sardinians lack only one educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Sardinian that we are not French – that was the ironic moto about themselves from the smallest federal state for their fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which in a study by the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
In this way, high schools traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Saarland is above average in higher education, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"In the Saarland, the system of vocational education is being harnessed," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in the education sector at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than one in five young people earn their bachelor’s degree at the Professional School, which means that Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That’s why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for engineering science specialties.
“After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms in the schools of general education,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the upcoming studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of pupils lagging behind in school development declined from 29 to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Saar did not improve as much as other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the dismay of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this area they could achieve good results.
Although Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez changes the time.
In the near future, there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez changed the timetable in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official State Bulletin of Venezuela, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States in its day imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced the breakup of relations with his neighboring Colombia due to hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would maintain no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do that,” says Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is driving a constitutional reform where the country’s citizens must decide Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said criticising Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to calculations by the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real-wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
“The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the stretch of food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research told the Bild newspaper.
Unemployment insurance can also be charged to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the "Neue Ostankrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over the course of a year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the Labour Office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it became public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food and petroleum derivatives sector reached the highest level in 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls in the poles, the same that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers have suspected that rays could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays call from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's origin of life, rays caused life on Earth: storms may have provoked reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it is not so: if there were ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500<0xC2><0xB0>C prevail on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
“Possibly, Venus is a ‘diabolic’ twin from Earth, but it’s still a twin,” Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest research results that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, highlight not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more Earth-like characteristics than we had anticipated,” ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vortex formed by the faster-rotating clouds.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has a mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called the sunrise star or evening star orbits the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day on Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar is not very similar to Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets there had been accumulation of water that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it split into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had turned into carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and for that reason demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case, we must not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, the Federal President emphasizes, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not distance himself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his dislike for the reception of the Dalai Lama and because of this was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperable foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in the Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to informative sources of the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of government of China, demanded that Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would welcome the Tibetan religious leader in their official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that riots such as those in France will occur.
Battles with police on the streets, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schauuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being taken to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot the police with rifles: after serious riots starring young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior, Wolfgang Schauble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We need to make sure that our country’s social problems do not take the violent form.”
“We have to take that seriously,” he said in the newspaper Neue Presse, published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits.
It's still too early to put the end of the alarm on hold.
At the same time, Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same edificatory and sociological problems as they do in France.
The youngsters played a leading role in serious riots on the streets with police north of Paris last night.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of a mimicry effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 was above average.
We need to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat underlines: “We have to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
It should "give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training job faster".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burnt cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers have been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Interior Minister, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The unrest began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor's office, the death of the young men was not the fault of the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolken.
The performance, far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more is to be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the accusation that was made against him for repeatedly devoting himself to foreign policy performances, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he does not want to understand what the critics are interested in.
In the lower house it was declared very clearly to all that the accusation was appropriate.
There was no sense of interest or of any kind of feeling about the problems of the country.
But instead, <0xC3><0x81>ngela Wolke presented herself this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it praised itself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself – for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
For he strives in expressions to get a boost to the people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about that subject using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong to talk when it comes to supplements for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He begins to stumble “as if he were in an unknown territory,” when it comes to more concrete information.
The Attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of Republican presidential candidates on YouTube and now they must fear only one outside party candidate.
Tensions between the candidates have been noted from the outset.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York City into "a refuge for illegal immigrants".
He, for his part, responded with serious accusations: "I would like to say that his own house was a 'port' for the illegals," Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed the illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: As so far the group of Republicans does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, also don’t have much content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s accusation of his opponent Ron Paul, the only one from the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from veterans of the Vietnam War, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown in their deaths.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida show that while the most important issues of the campaign are other, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said in a statement, apologizing to people and television audiences for advocating abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without uniform.
A day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath of office for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he was made to power by a bloodless military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the Musharraf oath will very soon cancel the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the west.
Since it was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, many of Musharraf’s pro-jurists have been in the process, and last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new election of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the Afghan border.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written in the band's best time.
In those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of them their box, their cables and above all their buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius, 63, dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia would make music again.
What has to be revolted here is this: the questions accurately have shown that the band’s name resounded in people’s minds, but it wasn’t so special that after 32 years the audience would miss it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misconception Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the Cologne Can 2003 band for their life work, the hall saw the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and in those times did not achieve a great effect in the audience, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist at the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist's life full of surprises.
They say that one day an Ottenstein Harmony singing association flag appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, this recording was attended by almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album at Griessmer, that is to be thanked by Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland set the goal of cultivating this own German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like Roedelius’ work, the band Neu! was rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony with producers appears on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who began to improvise again.
They do nothing more than fix the microphones to the organ and the battery to be able to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effect devices they had built with their own hands.
Today, electronic music is the way it should be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical setting one coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a term of English origin.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
On the stage it reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed too much on action and shooting or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is perhaps the most important argument to watch the movie "The Hunting Party - When a Hunter Becomes What He Pursues" (Why do the titles of the movies have to be so long and crappy these days?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had passed, that as a monument now in the ruin of his part of his decadence they preserve.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, prove to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moderischer Frieden" can be told in a nutshell: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads to falling in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because in reality there has never been a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another point, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story of American war reporters going to detect a war criminal Serb called “frog,” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
So, the stories are surprisingly similar: the little teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something the army can't do and every time it turns out a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we are initially introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynical with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnia that they will kill later.
Then “The Hunting Party” is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters achieve with impressive speed what they couldn’t for five years NATO, the CIA and all the hunters in the world, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnians to look just like Muslims.
It is so bad, they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, that one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are these demons too but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always a rule is worth it: when a star gets into a region of crisis or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "Across All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls out a good film about the holocaust with the film "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today perhaps we know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because scriptwriters don’t have the slightest fix (which is needed to be able to) to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still did not know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant gaze from an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's just because some things never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally murdered, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust received in response the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economy for not bidding for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general manager of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday said the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg’s ambitions to host the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund that is expected in early December, on Munich’s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance.”
Despite all this, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to bid for the Olympic Games.
“It’s too early to let the opportunity take away, if at this point the plans are ruined,” HSB director Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is contrary to the statement made by the head of the senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German public sports federation of higher schools (adh).
There, von Beust designated Hamburg’s 2015 university application not as a “replacement” of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the High School Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) denounced the Senate not taking advantage of such valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate was lagging behind with the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, MPs of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Is that so?
Currently, the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's work list.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Brillo-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm also carried out internal investigations and came to other disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes" are in the "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director's mule is in.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Moderna Museet were exhibited hundreds of Bright cardboard boxes. These did not Warhol (due to expenses), but they were brought directly from the cardboard factory of "Brillo".
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of wooden shimmer boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions, some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. Moreover, it is not about oil painting, but acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion.
In July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these “serious accusations” of soap dust boxes.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Antonio Trillanes, who accuses the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for shedding blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial on Thursday for attempting a coup d’état in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Obviously, the military police officers who were supposed to watch him had passed to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Adviser, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
“People are tired,” Trillans said.
“We call on people to come in our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that soon the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
Big government critics called for a big demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months, his government has received accusations of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company's absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entry into the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution maintains the equity for a third party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day got involved with nearly 10 percent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares with a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares from them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperation.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies formed a joint MSP company, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the start, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e. they make 18.49 percent share of Freenet.
That meant that both companies kept all the options, especially the participation in the company Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far, United Internet and Drillisch’s holding company had 6.01 percent of Freenet’s share.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
