The black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of money to improve the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at its solution in a small black box, which is getting cleaned up on your car’s dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor-driver and communicates that information to the authorities, is today the only way to finance the main roads of the United States. Its purpose is to restore the system that has become obsolete and to restore it.
In general, turbulent work such as highway planning has also suddenly become the subject of intense debate and lively alliances.
The mile you drive, and possibly the location you drive, to keep a description of the location you drive — and then use this information to prepare a tax bill — are the librettos in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes with the same amount of money.
The tea party is a good one.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising various kinds of privacy issues.
While the Congress did not agree on whether or not further action should be taken, many states are not waiting.
They are looking into how they can go into a system in the next decade in which the driver will pay for every mile set on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken a black box for the test drive, some of which is GPS monitoring.
This is a very important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether or not we choose to be elected," said Hasan Ikhrata, the executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which will start tracking every mile set by motor-drivers in California by the year 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way taxes are paid by us.
There is a technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's high-speed trust fund has become almost dilapidated, which is financed by the payment of taxes imposed on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
The U.S. is no longer buying gas.
Now the car runs more miles than ever before in a gallon of gas.
The federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians also avoid raising money in taxation.
Transportation policy expert Lee Munikh at the University of Minnesota says, "Gas tax is absolutely not negligible."
His state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "It will work as the most reasonable option in the long run."
Windows calls it a mileage-based user-fee.
It is not surprising that this idea is good for urban libertarians, as it can, for example, be changed in taxes to change the way of driving a car, which can help reduce jam and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are keen on the system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (APA) also considers black box to be the most viable long-term option.
The independent sellers at the Rejan Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy in Reykjav<0xC3><0xAD>k, said, "It's not just doing what's going into the dark pits."
People are paying more directly for what they’re getting what they’re getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had favoured moving forward in the direction of per-mile payment from Congress.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project, which included 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to go to the city on a daily basis, the House leadership ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It is the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest use.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee to the state instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
The city of New York is also moving in this direction.
Ilinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 State Transportation Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) with the Eastern CBO, is studying how they can implement this change. The I-95 alliance, which includes the East CBO
This idea has not been supported in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was recently installed on the cars of 50 volunteer car drivers, the driver was very impatient to think that the government could monitor their every step of the way.
Alauddin Khan, who directs the Strategic and Work-Enforcement Enforcement in the Nevada Department of Transportation, says "The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem."
It’s not the kind of thing people want.
As testing progressed, Nevada's ACLU had warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert this device into a full-tracking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology framework-structure, which would necessarily have to be disseminated to keep a record of each person’s daily coming-to-comings.
Nevada is one of many states that is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get a description of how many miles a day the car is going, but not where and for what time it is going.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called the Tru Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the market, emerging from auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But what the device is testing is good for the high-speed planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a certain time interval.
Dr. Rayan Morrison, chief executive of Trout Mileage, said, "If you don't track people's pace and place, they'll be more willing to take this approach."
There have been some major errors in these initial programs in the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-intervention ways to do this.
In Oregon, the planners are trying to give the drivers a variety of options.
They can choose the device of GPS with or without GPS.
Or again, no one can choose to take any device, instead they can choose to pay a fixed fee based on the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
It is hoped to other places that this concept could be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience instead of less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are attempting to develop such a taxing device, which will also have the facility of paying parking meter charges. Taxes will provide insurance for the "payment of taxes from the taxable person to the taxable person in accordance with the taxable amount of the tax payable by the taxable person" and others.
The city planning document states, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participate in it because of the benefits it brings."
However, some transportation planners are surprised that, according to the Mile, the whole discussion on payment is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that the Congress can handle the issue of the Diwalia Highway Trust Fund very easily by increasing the gas tax.
An additional one-time or annual fee may also be imposed on hybrid or other car drivers, whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their fair share.
The Commission's Director of Legislation and Public Affairs, Randy Rentsheller, said, "What ambulatory surgery is needed for aspirin when it can work?"
If we do so, millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
According to the police, his death was caused by drowning.
Albatta, her friend has been taken into custody by police on charges of hiding the belongings of the deceased.
The police have handed over the final report of the death investigation to the court.
On August 26, the police recovered the body of Jahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelam Sea.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his cellphones and other belongings were missing.
The police said the phone and SIM of the deceased were investigated and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in the solar system.
The woman told the inquiry that the phone was given to her by a relative of hers, Rouhal Gauhar.
Rouhail also lives in the five-storey garden and he was a friend of the late Jahid.
Rouhail was drowned in Zhelam with Jahid after prayer-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all his belongings on the edge, while Rohal went the other way for a cigarette.
When he came back, Zahid wasn’t there, he was just his clothes.
Rohal sought Jahid, but he did not find him.
He picked up his cell phone, watch and other belongings and kept them for his use.
He did not tell anyone that Jahid was drowned.
The police told the court that Jahid's death was caused by drowning and confirmed in the post-mortem.
Albatta, Rohal has been taken into custody under Section 404 to conceal the facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married the 28-year-old girl in a very informative manner.
This was revealed by his family friend, Marcel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Franciska Pascal in her private chapel.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a teen activist in the Forza Italia party.
These are the Franciscans, who were being told about their relationship that their relationship with Balrosconi was just showing.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Martha Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligence wedding.
The event was held three weeks ago.
When Polanco was asked what would happen if the two got married on Italian Radio 2, Polanco said the two were already married.
It was not a public ceremony.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the house of the former Prime Minister.
No one can say anything else.
However, he did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjode.
The two got married about three weeks ago, i.e. on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old 28-year-old woman from Francesca Pascal was transplanted.
To avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi had laid the groundwork for loneliness behind his decision.
Even in the lower regions, the rain continued to stop and stop between the sun's eyes.
With this, the entire plaintiff has started to freeze.
The cold can be predicted by the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, in Gulmarg -0.2 degrees below zero and in Leh -1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, due to rain and snowfall, the strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has been closed to traffic.
There has been heavy snowfall on the Jojila dam.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the mountainous regions of Kashmir.
Due to the activity of the Western Vikshob, the snowfall in the upper and lower areas of the plaintiffs began on the same day, which continued until late evening.
The cold also affected the general public's lives.
People were staying in their homes to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, the power supply in many areas has also been halted.
The maximum temperature of the day in Srinagar was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius below normal.
The rains in Jammu and Kashmir have also increased during the night due to heavy rains.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was 16.6 and the maximum 27.0 degrees Celsius was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the western divide has begun to occur and the weather will improve from Friday onwards.
According to Sonam Lots, director of the Srinagar Meteorological Department, the weather in the plaintiffs is likely to remain dry from November 1 to November 7.
Assaram, who was jailed on charges of sexual harassment, was once again disillusioned with the Supreme Court on Friday.
He is being presented in the media coverage filed on behalf of Assaram as a children's blood-drinking drug, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P Satshiwam, refusing to order the media to stop running news about Assam, said that he had seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason for him to comment on it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Assaram's lawyer had accused the media that he was showing up on the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these pleadings and refusing to intervene in the case said that they have more options.
Earlier, the court had already rejected the demand for a ban on media coverage in the country.
Department officials have claimed that it is the largest case of TDS theft to date.
The group manager of Mall cut the TDS and paid the related financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
In doing so, the TDS was depositing the rupee with him.
On October 17, the Mumbai Exploration Team and the Jaipur Exploration Team took action against the group.
It was revealed in the investigation that this trader had cut the TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the TDS team on Thursday launched an Income Tax Survey on the group.
Nearly 15 days before, the risk of the account being sealed, a search and survey was carried out on the group of this mail manager.
Angry at the move, the trader has made it clear to Income Tax Department officials that they are not yet ready to pay the Income Tax Department in the rupee of TDS.
The Income Tax Department is constantly taking action by targeting them.
Investigating authorities in the case have made it clear that recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in the event of no payment.
With Diwali, the demand for sweets is growing.
With this in mind, the sale of fake and fake monkeys is on the rise.
Chemicals are used to make the sweetness more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against counterfeit mawa and chemically engineered sweets.
The department seized from Madhya Pradesh 70,000 Mawa and Quetta colonies 5 thousand.
As the demand for sweets in the market has increased, so has the demand for decrepit mave from Madhya Pradesh.
Ghatia Mave, who was kept in dirt, was given the information to bring from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Khep Mave is being transported to Nagpur from the transport garage.
The department took possession of the mave, the price of which was Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not give anyone the right to a bribe.
The department destroyed it by considering undeclared (unclaimed) property.
The department recovered nearly 5,000 glitters by imprinting on the Quetta Colony-based Jitendra Caters.
A chemistry called sodium hydrosulfate was used to shine and last for a longer period of time.
A sample of this will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, co-commissary of the department, said that the chemical commission will continue the campaign of smuggling sweets and gingia and fake apples.
In the next few days, this campaign and information has been given by the department to accelerate.
Consumption of these sweets can also be contagious.
The department asked the sweeteners to make good milk, candy from mave.
The appeal has been made to the people on the part of the Department to be wary of fake sweets and honey.
The 42 senior leaders of the BJP, who were elected by the BJP, made a strong appearance at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to Bihar for a visit to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
"""The """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
It is noteworthy that a total of seven explosions took place in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's hunkar rally.
Indian Mujahideen terrorists who were involved in the blasts had marched to Bhagaddar during the rally, so that more people were killed and became the atmosphere of terror in the country.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people were killed in the explosions.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party's leaders have travelled from their village to Asty-Kalsh since Thursday.
All of these facilities will be flown together into the Ganga in Patna on November 5.
This is a part of the Consolation Journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of the people killed in the explosions on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this visit, they will also provide a check of Rs 5-5 to the families of the deceased.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already announced this financial aid.
The Indian team, excited by the explosive win in the last match, will have to take the series with a win when M Chinnaswami is down against Australia in the seventh and final ODIs on Saturday.
India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series after two consecutive ODI matches due to the rain and its batsmen gave him a record win in the series 2-2.
India has scored more than 350 runs twice in the series and will once again be responsible for the batsmen to cross the team's goal.
The Indian batting is at the extreme at the moment and a bigger goal is also proving to be a badass in front of him.
While Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in strong form, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will remain in high hopes for the team.
As far as the opening is concerned, the team as Rohit and Shikhar has got a salutary pair that is making it easier for the rest of the batsmen to work with a firm partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat the chance to play without any pressure while he had a great partnership in the opening.
"""What Virat has done so far, Kohli is considered Sachin Tendulkar of the future."
But many of the cricket pandits have given him a better title than Sachin.
Virat has scored 17 ODIs in the coming week, 16 of which have been won by India for 25 years.
While pursuing the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but the extreme dependence on these three could also be a loss for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flapped in the previous match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a case, a good ferry 'lifeline' can work for them in the Bengaluru ODI.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Belle, have influenced everyone with his performance.
He is also in demand to go to the Test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to the ninth innings.
In addition to Belle, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogues and James Foxner have played well in the series.
However, Phil Hunz and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling could be severe for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
"""Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists in the face of peace,""" said BJP National Executive Member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh."
Referring to a report by intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Tuesday that Pakistan is emphasizing a spike to infiltrate nearly 2,000 terrorists at its training camps.
There will never be peace on the border for that.
Pakistan has become even more bleak after the mansuffocation of the separatists to deteriorate the situation on a large scale by inflaming the people in Kashmir.
Referring to last year's Pakistani visit of the separatists, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lieutenant General Zahir ul Islam, Lashkar, Hezbollah's Sargana Hafiz Sayyed and Saeed Salahudin had believed in 2014
"Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise seriously,"" he said."
The killings of soldiers at the border, the suicide attacks in Samba and Hirannagar are part of the same strategy.
In such a situation, the BJP leader condemned the demand to end the privileges of the army in the state as deadly, saying that it is also against the people to do so until there is a lasting peace in the state.
They are used against the anti-national elements.
He stressed that the statements of the leaders of the army, the security forces should be stopped from falling morale.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence official, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and its director, Keith Alexander Gatti, are present.
German M.P. Hans Christian Strauss Belle, met with Mr. Snow Den in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum to speak about testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "While the results of my efforts are proven positive, my government along with Bharatiya Janata Party - Kadhi Akshay Akshay Akshay Akshay Akshay Akshay Akshay Akshay Akshay Akshay, and no bailouts are provided.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community could relinquish the U.S. government to avert criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include secrecy and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Online Zeit: "Mrs. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been hacked.
Thomas Opperman, MP who is chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence. He said that if Mr. Snowden had the opportunity to listen as a witness, "to completely destroy relations with the U.S., and even to endanger them," he said.
Mr. Strauss Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their trip to Russia.
Mr. Bellene said that, according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snowden is not able to go back to Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, MEPs said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that "he had to face a fierce and continuous campaign" for him to be forced to leave the house.
However, he said that the world is happy and enthusiastic by broad responses to "his work of political expression."
Including the United States - the world's citizens as well as senior officials are looking at the secrecy of a responsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to co-operate with German officials "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carriers will be charged on-board luggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge a $100 charge for luggage charge for passengers on board their planes - on-store.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging a charge for $100 for an on-line bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers can hold the entire box.
New Carry-on charge is for the bag in overhead bin, so, the small bag under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier said that $25 will charge if the advance is paid, $100 will have to wait if the passenger waits to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee has to be obtained to take care of the charges in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge it," he said.
The airline started charging for the first and second check-bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to fill in as much as they can are trying to avoid the tariffs in the carry-on-baggage that has the status in the overhead box means there is often less space in this box.
There is a way to bring a discount for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charges.
It is for the most loyal customers about Frontier that it has become difficult to quickly find the place of overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay for it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line on a frontier gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry - on-fee, will not start until the summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline service likes them.
They argue that the money is spent to handle the luggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
The cost of luggage on Wall Street is seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, don't even have a charge on their luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched Carrie - On Charge for the first time three years ago, and partner discounter Allegiant Air later.
The other airline with such a charge is Wizz Air of Hungary, which the airline's consultant J Sorensen said, and which tracks the add-on fee.
He said Spirit's Carry-On tax brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former midwest airline official, recently boarded a flight in Spirit and surprised passengers at the gate to face an unusual bag-fee.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to brush my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The armor was full and he said it was lickety-split climbing."
Frontier is also tracking the $2 fee of Spirit' for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The frontier recommends that those who will take the soda, or juice, can hold the entire jar, and this free coffee will only be given once.
It will still take the water away.
The U.S. Airways briefly attempted to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months after the passengers complained they retreated and any other major airlines followed after being there.
Frontier's passengers if they don't buy directly from the airline then this step of Frontier's toll-charge online is its fresh effort to operate customers towards its own website.
Airlines pays the online travel seller from Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold for such a $10 to $25.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them, rather than going through an online travel agency, rather than going through them.
The frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, a number of flights were often scheduled to be delivered to customers who had purchased them from an online travel agency at a distance of half the mile.
On Wednesday, it reduced the Mileage Award to 25 per cent of the Trip Mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier Trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It is also that they allow only passengers to choose their seat in advance when buying directly from the Frontier website.
Denver, Frontier has a loyal customer base in the city of its home, but it's getting less business and it's losing money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flight capacity fell by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republic is trying to determine Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the airline.
N.S.A. Accused of "Internal Error" Instead of Hackers to Be Website Crash
The secretive National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical deficiencies, our website had been shut down for a few hours, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
The intelligence agency said in a statement sent to the email, "Tonight NSA.gov was not in access for several hours, which was due to an internal error occurring during the pre-determined update."
Tonight, the problem will be solved.
It is not true that the claim that this obstruction, dispensed denial of service [D.D.O.S.] came due to attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website had been shut down for at least six hours, and the site is still not accessible to some users.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network had "not at all" been compromised.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the N.S.A. website by the D.D.O.S. attack.
The D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that so much traffic is sent to the target website until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively obsolete and the purpose of the attacks is not to discriminate between the internal network of the target system.

Decreased profits of Bombardier as delivery of aircraft, Decreased orders
Canada's Aircraft and Train Maker Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 percent drop in net profit, in its train unit in the third quarter and under pressure from aircraft orders and deliveries on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on the issues of any flight test data release for its brand new CSeries aircraft or its ambitious program to go into commercial service from next September.
About a month and a half after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has only been flown three times, questioning whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell less than forecast and the stock has been sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for sliding by more than 8 percent.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst stock with National Bank Finance, has cut its rating from "mother" to "field performance" on Thursday, the stock is limited to upwards over the next one or two quarters.
"Commercial aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Doorsen said in a customer note.
We will receive a new order for the Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new order is being announced in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be suspicious.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family will now be able to replicate it in the lesser end of the coveted market of Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flown for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Prospective buyers of the new Jetliner wait for the flight test result to accept the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as for the CSeries I have a fixed order of up to 177.
With 15 customers and operators, 403 full orders and commitments are available.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin believed that Bombardier would meet its 300-signature order target from the time it first brought the Jet into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was running as scheduled.
"The test aircraft had been on the ground for a long time than expected," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that it was also determined during the ground testing and software update aircraft intervals.
Each manufacturer creates a schedule in a different way.
We have decided to make a first flight and an update period and said what we have done.
This is why the flight will take place through the program.
The rest of the five test aircraft are expected to fill in the flight in the coming weeks, with the following shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts believe that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft in the first 12 months after their first flight.
Bombardier has said that it has evaluated the Entry Service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - though in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our idea that the entry service will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year ago.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion in small dives.
According to analysts Thomasson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenues of 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were delivered below 57 a year ago, during the quarter
The clean order dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the Aerospace Division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change from December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the consumption of the following order and overall market situation were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
A 13 per cent drop in aerospace revenues to $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train maker, the division's revenues increased by about 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The order in the transport unit was backlogging around $32.6 billion on September 30, up from December 31.
Some large contracts in the margins of the Transport Department were also affected by issues of execution.
The new guidelines will be provided in the fourth quarter, the executive officials said.
In Bombardier's shares, in which Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Picchett, announced the inclusion of the board, there were also 8.5 percent below C$4.83 in mid-afternoon business on Thursday.
Brazil's Embryor SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and its closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
The new research has revealed that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
No one is lying to you and no one is thinking about stealing or cheating.
But in the evening our minds change and we begin to put the ideal on one side against the rule.
Researchers at Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business of Utah have given a number of interesting facts in this research.
According to the researchers, in the morning without work stress, we prefer moral values, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to fatigue or increased pressure.
For this purpose, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people were told that the point is higher on the left or right side.
Those who took part were told that if they answered the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be given money.
It was observed in this experiment that between 8am and 12am the people who were used did not make any mistakes and gave the correct answer.
While using people between noon and 6:00 p.m., it was found that they deliberately misrepresented their remedies.
The researchers were able to prove that the lack of money in the morning makes no difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop embarrassing the morals.
This research has been published in the latest scores of the Psychological Sciences.

Incarceration of Adhi Advocate of Cocaine giving secret information about police investigation to Shri Bigg
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta reported to the notorious criminal Neil Skarboro
The lawyer thought that people might find out about his secret nasty drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The top defence lawyer, who told Shri Bigg about the main police investigation, because he was afraid that the people would find out about his secret smear of the nasty drug, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
After the 42-year-old Detta made a deal on his cocaine addiction, the notorious criminal Neil Skarboro provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his nasty drug smuggling activities.
This lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and praised by the perpetrators as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after the police surveillance operation in Skarboro. Tahti was arrested from his home in 2011.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Skarboro holding three bags of cocaine at his lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
After Detta's hair, her buttons, and her credit card received cocaine particles, the investigation found that Detta was a "regular user" of Class A narcotic drugs.
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegally information about the arrest of two people on the part of Skarboro and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine group operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseside, Berkeshire and West Yorkshire.
It included 32 other persons, who were sent to jail during several raids for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta was informing the perpetrators, as he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
The situation in Blackbender, a law firm working at Forbes Solicitors, Ditta, Liverpool Crown Court for up to three weeks after a trial in Karnataka after a court-martial in Kathleen was found guilty of violating Kathleen Kathleen's way of justice
He had agreed to keep cocaine in the previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad timing began at the time when police found out that he had been in regular phone contact with Detta since February 2011 while investigating Skarboro.
Two spies chased the suspect and saw him coming into the house of Ditta and holding more than 60 per cent pure narcotic drugs under the lawyer's bean in Black Golf Glove.
He was in regular contact on the phone with Scarborough Ditta, who had gone out for dinner at the Blackburn Rowers Football Stadium, Ewood Park after the nasty drug was taken.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, he found out that the nasty drug had been kept there and that there had been nine conversations between them.
The court heard that Detta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the test when she was found infected with a Class A counterfeit drug on her hair, buttocks and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer, as he was his client, and said his discussion was the subject of "legitimate privileges."
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by pulling out his buttocks, but they had been confiscated, and his hair sampled.
In the police interview, he said he was running the office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his client was calling at his home for legal cases.
After being told by the main persons arrested what the spies knew about him, the court said in the hearing that Ditta was calling the main people of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously filed the case.
Annie White, on the part of the prosecution, said: "The criminal attorney should know best about not breaking the law."
It is alleged that Mr. Detta misused his post as a criminal lawyer, to associate too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a general narcotics dealer, but rather about a dealer who is providing narcotics to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been more legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his own line of attorney-client relationship.
He interrupted the investigation of the police as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Detta was not respecting his profession, but was insulting.
He made a lot of close contacts with some certain clients, especially with Skarboro, and he allowed the deal to be negotiated with his independence.
Detta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Skarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would immediately do it.
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Hallstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mrs. Ditta, at the time she began receiving nasty drugs from organized criminals, at the same time she made herself a criminal lawyer."
Due to his cocaine leakage, he made an excessive deal and became much weaker against the goals of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to the police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of truthfulness, and people should be filled with trust and self-confidence.
Mr. Ditta has cheated with this belief and has tried to escape in his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lankashire investigated Mr. Ditta, in which he was also found guilty of three incidents of holding cocaine and now disrupting the path of justice, which is the pretext of bringing the perpetrators to court.
The case should act as a warning to the perpetrators that no person is far from access to the law.
We will take you out of the investigation and present you before the court.
Skarboro was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of embezzlement for supplying heroin, cocaine and bang.
Thirty other members of the group were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said that her fantastic job would be to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in the U.S., Mohammad Ali's dinner guest and inequity for his work.
Kenya's press acquitted of controversial media law
Defying the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said, "This is a terrible place, and it is valid to ask: What is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the freedom of the judiciary in the coming tomorrow?"
Capital Group - which is the managing company of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM., CEO Cyrus Kamau said: "It is cruel and very penalizing to the law. It is very criminal.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is part of the government itself" and said that banning the subject-matter and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to send back the MPs by rejecting this bill,"" he said."
According to the Star News newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with "strict control over the media", while the standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "has been hit hard" and called the bill cruel.
The bill is being passed in September as one of the measures to strengthen national security following an attack by Islamic gunmen at the Westgate Shopping Mall.
Kenya's media had broadcast security camera footage of the documents sent to the attacking site, showing them looting the mall in the south, causing the official's media to become irritated.
Police chief David Kimyo had sent a summons to interrogate two journalists and a media worker, though the summons had been withdrawn after being harassed by the media.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenya Shilling and 10 lakh Kenya Shilling can be fined on media companies and various journalists, as well as, as an additional "remove from the file" or official press release.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the infringer if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "The majority of F.M. stations are only one centimetre enough to shake the foundation."
It also said that due to these measures there may be pervasive effects that are described as the "living blogosphere" of Kenya.
By shutting down the media, politicians know they can do their will.
Nation's journalist Mutuma Matthew Kenney writes describing the media as the main source of control and balance in public life, describing "no one will ever know."
"When the rulers are left, they will divulge the country and bring us back to the era of hunts and looting,"" he wrote."
In the past, Kenyan legislators have had to deal with people's anger.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission, and had recovered about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free wage, which is considered to be among the highest in the world.

The issue of Mozambique's security concerns is rising as powerful personalities collide
With a statue of Mozambique-founding President Samora, who was spinning down on them, thousands of people gathered in Central Maputo for a rare public display of peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Afraid of his country's future, he changed his corporate outfit from "We Demand Security" to a print T-shirt in Portugal and he joined the crowd of the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
Conflicts between government officials and Ray Namo have been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebellion of white-ruled Rhodesia and the disparity of South Africa backed by the government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have swayed foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, with some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Welle, and Eni, seeking to locate the vast accumulative gas storage and coal storage of the West, likely to invest more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo party, the main political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for tensions.
Ra Namo said the government started the latest conflict by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La province, a traditional Ra Namo fortress, on October 17.
The attack on the former rebels and the rise of the government forces attacked the Renmo sites and told the Financial Times of the attempt to kill Afonso Dhaka, group leader, Fernando Majang, spokesperson for Ray Namo.
The government blames Ray Namo for the attack on the troops and condemns the clashes for triggering the attack.
President Armando Gibuzzan has called for the destabilization of the country to be ignored.
Mr. Gibuzhan told AFP, French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "higher" "whatever his armies have been trying to prove that he can enforce his decision on the government."
Free Limo and Ray Namo both insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Majhang was cited as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was repealed by Ray Namo but later became a matter of concern again.
He told the FT that the deal is not being honoured by Free Lime
"Our vision is to come back for the agreement talks, but seriously," Mr. Mejhang said.
The last talks between the two sides didn't do anything special to alleviate the tensions of a series of this year's conflict.
"It's about two big men (Gebuzzan and Dhakama) fighting together," said Yusuf Han, a lecturer at London Open University and a Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good talkers, nor of them is it necessary that they are prepared to make kinds of concessions.
Ray Namo, insisting on electoral reforms, had already spoken about the abolition of municipal corporation elections that were taking place in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an attempt by a patient movement to win concessions and economic loot from the government.
Ray Namo's share in the polls has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo member, was formed in which Mozambique's (MDM) Democratic Movement hopes to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Majhang says Mr. Gibuzhanko - who has left office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want multi-ethnic democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Majhang said.
What kind of capacity Ray Namo has not been clear, but it has been a major visit to the police stations and vehicles on a north-south highway, he said.
Most of the clashes are in La Province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, which hosts the port of Bera which relies on coal exporting to miners including Rio Tinto and the valley.
After the threat of attacking the Ray Namo line, in June, Rio suspended its operation for nearly a week.
Mr. Ra Namo was Mr. Majangvinit when asked whether or not this threat would be repeated.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to alert the international community," Mr. Majhang said.
The instability government has further escalated the crackdown, Fernando Lima, Media Coop, who is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the flood of kidnappings.
"People are the people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and think he should be one to find solutions to the problems," they say.
Omar Sultanat, an exhibitor, people still need to be sustainable.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want to have free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught to be "a model for a way of life of the author" ,methods and mathematicians.
Thor's stories could show "there is no match of subtle all-rounders in cruel power," while Equarian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
"It would not be appropriate to teach this in schools and even in the wild even at an extraordinary distance to teach many of the myths," Cross Lee Holland said of one of the "careful choices" of the age.
"I think it's amazing, in America, myth and folk music are already a part of the field of education," he said.
I've been doing this as a plan for 20 years.
He has called the writers and teachers "more talkative" and it's "a new twist" for children, along with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated biowolf from Anglo Saxons along with writing a penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "Your intentions may be a lot, but out of sight."
Perhaps for an adult writer to write, and for an adult writer to write, a large difference between an adult needs some meanings of hope.
Everything has to come to a simplistic or a happy ending, because but it is an easy feeling of good and evil.
And said that submissions should be made, rather than being said to be made known through a story.
It doesn't show the old base.

Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New York
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in the United States: about a hundred years ago, humorous playwright Frank Fee, who acted as the master of the ceremonies at the Chowk Palace in the Chowk Theatre in Broadway.
Fe's research has expanded over the years, most recently, in the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsh, founder of the Stand Up Institute named Carolines, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became very big successes, to the point where they became too big to be played in the club," Hirsh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy, "Stand Up For" for Military Retired Persons in the Madison Square Garden.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
A lot of comedians participating in this year’s festival have come from non-traditional media, such as the Comedy Central, F.X. and the upcoming shows on small networks like Spike.
Nick Crowe reached the top spot from Deep-Cable Sitcom (F.X.X.'s unusually runny fantasy-football theme "The League"), and now he has his own comedy Central Sketch Show.
Janey Slate has been a cast meme for "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel Di Shell With Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate, (especially Anthony Jeselnik, a disillusioned, ethnicity-centered w.K. Durious Bell) American comedy comedy
One of the main attractions of the festival will be, an interview: David Steinberg's Larry David Talking:
Steinberg had started working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unauthorised comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted the show "City Down Comedy With David Steinberg" on T.V. Land.
The meeting will take place in the center of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
"The city is certainly in the comedy of all Larry's works," Steinberg said.
They were telling me that, when they were here, sometimes they went into the alley between two buildings and thought to themselves that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall towards $96 per barrel.
There is a worrying offset in a report that is continuing to fall towards the price of oil, such as more supplies on Friday, where the power-hungry construction sector in China is strengthening.
For December delivery, the benchmark was down 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in electronic trading in Europe late in the morning on the U.S. crude New York Mercential Exchange.
The contract fell 5.8 per cent for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil is based on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
For more than five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand in the activity has revealed from Izafa that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come on Friday.
This shows that the development could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after 7.8 per cent decline in the previous quarter in the third quarter of a two-decade period.
Brent Crude is also a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refiners, falling from $ 108.58 per barrel to 26 cents per barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
The court has barred action on New York Police Department's pause and sporting policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case, requiring a judge's order for a break and a sports programme of the New York Police Department.
Shira Shindler, Judge of the U.S. Circuit Court Appeal 2 and has said that the outcome of the judge's decision will be awaited upon the outcome of an appeal by the city.
In August, a decision was made in violation of the Constitution in a way that prevents people and excludes them from their program of interrogation.
The decision of the City Police Department to allocate a Surveillance to help change its policy and the training program associated with it is also included, its findings and its remedial order have appealed.
The appellate court heard the plaintiffs on Tuesday on the request for travel.
The appellate court has said that since it made a necessary agreement for a judge to avoid the presence of a party in a series of media interviews and by the public to go to the House of Commons to the House of Representatives of the United States of America, the Code of Conduct differs from the Code of Conduct for the Judges of the United States.
The judge ruled that police officers incorrectly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and sports program.
He has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes in policies, training, and supervision, including financial reforms, and he is most likely to shut down where a pilot program has been ordered to test body-wearing cameras in some premises.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police arrest.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The pause and sport jukti has been criticised with civil rights advocates.
Rest and sports policy has been around for some form of decades, but most of the black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to 2011, have dramatically stopped the rise under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A suit was filed by four men by all the minorities in 2004 and became a case of a class action.
Supporters of the change in the NYPD's pause and sports program have said that the unwarranted behavior will end with a more reliable and effective police force that will have to defend and affect the use of the police department's policies.
Opponents say the change will reduce the police's morale, but crime, money wasting and solving a widespread problem of a police force under pressure from thousands of officers during the past decade not yet.
The judge has noted that there had not been an end to the pause and play, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakud, Jamshedpur, Dhanabad, Hazaribagh and Chatara districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were informed of several studies including tent pitching and flagpole.
The training is being carried out with the cooperation of Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are breaking the spirit of unity by engaging in prayer.
The Camp Chief Minister, Vipin Kumar, is providing special assistance to the State Training Commissioner.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm the secret information. . . .
The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Colson, has been accused of having made a so-called "secret statement" in an attempt to confirm the so-called "secret information" in a "phone hacking" about his relationship while he was a secretary to Charles Clarke's house.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was meeting with her "attractive special counsel" Hannah Paulby.
The court said the newspaper had appointed private investigator Glenn Mulker to hack Paulby's voicemail and "stay" the man, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said "The prosecuting party's suggestion is that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of the N.O.T.W., is not known to stand outside the people's house and keep an eye on them, but rather to keep the articles in front of the people."
He said that the N.O.T.W. used three ways to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and amana-samna.
The third one included the editors themselves.
It is obvious that he knew the other way i.e. about the Nirvana, he necessarily knew.
What about the first one?
Did you know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew."
The rumor about Clark's sexual relations was first presented by A.O.T.W.'s feature desk at the time when a sexually desirable source in Ms. Paulby said: "Don't waste your time," he's with Charles.
From Mulker's home in August 2006, a tape of Voicemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Paulby's phone.
The investigators also found such entries in the private investigator's computer, which was dubbed the "Project" by Ms. Paulby and his sister.
During the period during which he was being investigated, he was being asked for information by mistakenly calling Ms. Paulby's grandparents.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Wedderup watched Ms. Paulby's arrival.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them via a voicemail: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that Colson's involvement in the case is only in the parton with other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The court heard on Thursday that Colson had been talking to Ms Blanket about her relationship with a married woman while she was looking at the case of co-respondent Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to intercept with other people for hacking the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulker, Thurlebeck and Vederap have accepted phone hacking.
Increasing corporate fears about state surveillance with the openness of the NSA.
In late August, on a quiet day, a German police helicopter crashed at the U.S. Embassy in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the mission of the German domestic intelligence agency, was to photograph the roof of the U.S. headquarters, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media asked BfV to express its hopes of identifying the presence of Leasing Antenna and signalled an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the United States and Berlin.
James Klepper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, emphasized that the United States "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and steal the trade secrets of its foreign intelligence capabilities and do not allow U.S. firms to grow in the U.S." Their international competitiveness has increased.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made the whistleblower, began to tell the U.S. Treasury the secret, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director is not right to keep his promise.
The U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on Brazil's oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahu expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was ringing, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, then of course the leaders of the business world are also making potential targets.
Snowden has made the deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible for these data to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, who represents German small and medium-sized IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the U.S. has almost now become a major risk, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked in all documentation by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that the U.S. went to the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union. And it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
"Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google,"" he said."
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again. . . .
"This is not the way," said Haso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, "This is not the way."
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany settles down, from coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The U.S. technological advances and espionage access revealed by Snowden has proven to be the biggest surveillance threat to some of the companies that were previously believed to be China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing era where European officials are more aware that data stored in the United States is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey released by Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members plan to cancel the use of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the discovery of the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s co-executive chief executive, says: “We saw a new question that didn’t come to customers a year ago – that’s what – my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest report just confirms what they already knew: that the powerful states want to steal their most inestimable secrets and data and for that should be at all costs.
The fact that it is an economic espionage is not a surprise.
It has always come.
"It's been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.
The U.S. is spying on us at the commercial and industrial level and so are we, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not keen on the defense system and it is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it’s been a long time coming to the record whether it’s unwise to leave a home business with a USB stick, or at least unwise to leave a laptop in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car maker Audi, says that this is an all-old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because their use as remote hearing devices could not be
Germany's BfV executives advise to consider using a simple prepaid mobile when smartphones are compromised due to the risk on overseas tours.
The prepaid mobile phone was later discarded.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many of these companies are in the forefront of the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies are often inexperienced, effectively protecting corporate secrets against employees and unauthorised access to financial resources," BfV warns in a report.
The U.S. has warned other countries about the economic espionage of its own companies.
According to the France The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. national intelligence agency in February was named in a second tier of criminals involved in the hacking, behind China and Russia.
According to the board members of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: "The services are well aware that all countries, even if they co-operate in a non-terrorist fight, spy on their allies."
The U.S. is spying on us at the commercial and industrial level and so are we, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one was stupid.
The parents of Georgian teenager who was killed in a 'unique accident' believe his son was murdered
A Georgian teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a resting mat at his high school gym is believed to have been murdered by his son, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A.K. Kendrick Johnson was found trapped in a mat directly behind the blisters inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators at Landes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in a "unique accident", but the 17-year-old's family denied it.
Attorneys for Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, Benjamin Kramp, told the Fox News Dot Com that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered."
He is not at all confident in the manner in which the sheriff told him.
"They believe that this is beyond the rationale of physical rules and general intelligence,"" he said."
They think this conclusion is a statement for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he came back in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mullere said on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder caused by a crime?
Mure said the matter at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever we go.
My goal is to bring the truth to light.
"I believe that there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told the reporter that there were indications in the primordial body test that Johnson's death was as a result of "stage retardation."
According to Moore, a different cause of death was found in a second body test in the same way."
"There are a lot of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,"" he said."
Moore also said that if he finds enough evidence to cross-examine a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the County Sheriff's Office.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the judges to release all surveillance videos that were reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they are hoping to get some indications from the video footage of how his death had occurred.
The CDC has issued guidelines for children's allergies to the schools.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines to control children's food allergies at the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children who go to school is increasing due to food allergies.
Currently, one in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that cases of food allergy in children between 1997 and 2007 have increased by 18 per cent.
This guideline informs schools how to inform teachers and staff about the food allergies of children, and in the event of any allergic reaction, how to deal with them.
Schools have also been suggested to keep a stock of Apenephrine - the auto-injector of the Apenephrine brand - to cope with potentially known acute anaphylaxis. The most common of which is esta.
The state legislature has recently updated the rules so that schools can easily stock up on more apnephrine.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms that are communicated by children affected by an allergic reaction.
Children can say “it seems like something is sneezing in my tongue,” “it seems like there’s hair on my tongue,” or “it’s sneezing in my tongue.”
Intersex Kids' Parents Can Choose Their Children's 'Ling Indefinite'
Germany has become the first country of the European Union to grant recognition to the third gender for children born with obscure genital mutilation.
Newborn children will no longer be identified as male or female in a modest manner.
Under the new law, there is no need for parents to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender “unspecified” or “unspecified” on the child’s birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make gender-determination decisions for newborn children in an expeditious manner, as well as to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "No, I'm a man, not a woman."
I'll continue to make the wound made by the doctors, scratched pawns.
It is estimated that one child in every 2,000 children per year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the examination of sexual developmental disorders, this is a collective term that has abnormal traits, genitalia (infertility or excretion), or abnormally viciously.
It's possible that Walisy Simpson was intersexing.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender-determination may not be possible, it is better to use the best available information to identify the gender. The best way to know the gender is to use the best available information, the best way to know the gender, and the best way to do it.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender-identification cases, said Germany's new law "seems to be a good thing."
Intersex causes children to develop moral instability.
"Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires paramedic, but most children are not in a situation like this," he said.
You can specify the sex even without the scar-medicine, and then see how the identification develops after that.
The science of knowing how a child will develop sex is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this is happening.
It's kind of a mystery as to why people are gay.
In the report submitted to the European Commission in 2011, Intersex persons have not been described as transsexuals or transgender persons in any way, in the same way as in the case of transsexuals or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but rather to sexual relations.
These features can manifest themselves as secondary sexual inclinations, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual inclinations such as in the reproductive organs and genitals; or in the reproductive organs; or in the reproductive organs.
This report also provides insights into the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-uniform sex.
Australia and Nepal have already been given permission for adults to mark male, female, or "third-sex" on their official documents, according to the report.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "lingingless" person after winning legal appeals to hold "unspecified" sex status for life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, there will also be a third specification for intersex persons as X in the German passport in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender-related issues in the neighbouring country in France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French law-makers from this strictly Catholic country have signed on a petition to retrieve the "Ling Principle" from the school's books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also objected to this law of Germany saying, "While the world is going in a state where the sex is self-chosen, there are options to go, but not in sexual activity, we are two more states of civilization."
The mother of the newborn baby in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would like to see the children be gendered at the time of birth.
He said on the website of Parenting, "Parenting is very stressful without additional boundaries, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children are in need of stability and reassurance.
Historically, the children who were born with both genitals were called Harmaphrodites (Ubiylingi), which were in the name of the beautiful Greek deity who were twins.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world regarded sex as a slit that could be erased and then written down.
But now a lot of people are challenging the morality of pediatrics, they are understanding that gender-identification is a complex job, and sometimes even mistakes can be made by doctors, who don't know what their gender will be about when the child grows up.
“In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a ‘mental emergency’,” says Dresher.
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the psychiatrist.
The existing principle of treatment of children with obscure genital mutilation was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hapkins University, who considered sex to be feasible.
He formulated the word "gender identification" and argued that social and environmental indicators - how parents parent the child - determine whether or not to identify the child by interfering with the child's genes and hormones.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child, whose sex had been accidentally sexed during the lining-up (circulation) session, to remove her vagina by fully bonding the child and make her look like a lad-up girl.
"Mani presented the case as a success case of temporary, but it did not happen,"" he said."
At the age of 15, the child changed himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that some doctors are still "following that pattern," he said.
But with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s, individuals undergoing these gender-based medicine began to come forward "not happy with the results".
The same case was with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with X.Y. Male genetics, but his birth name was unclear.
The doctors did not clearly understand that her sex was small, or her boss was large, but they were certain that she could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So in the year 1976, shortly after her birth, Bruce was discharged from the external organs and the intestinal tract-medicine and became like an adult girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn’t happy, but it was hard to ask.
At the age of 18, she was going to have a vaginal plastitis with him.
But feeling depressed and a bit depressed, she demanded medical records, and she said.
This made him aware of the horrific truth.
When I was born, I was bound - and no one ever told me.
Bruce had been born with the D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, causing his genitals to be unable to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he returned to being a man, he took a dose of testosterone and removed his breasts.
Because of his medical condition, he was devastated.
Today, he explains to people in an organization called the Interface Project to generalize their perceptions about intersex individuals.
But, Annie Tamer-Matis, the administrative director of California-based legal group Advocates for the Informed Wise, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chips and tricks."
They say, "Many activists think that the law of Germany will prompt parents to make a quick decision and motivate them to specify the child to be "indeterminate."
"We are afraid that this will encourage the intervention,"" he said."
We think that rather than waiting, it is a better process to specify the male or female gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said his organization supports the Australian law because it "allows adults to be identified in the third gender," according to the report.
"""Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender,"" he said."
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at the time of birth.
It is not a jungle that is being fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Petersberg's Breast Radiologist Dr. Erlene Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual developmental disorder, and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that Germany's law "makes parents and children both happy."
Baratji's daughter Katy was born with male genetics, but she had a D.S.D. called full androgen insensitivity contraception.
Since her androgenic gland was defective, female abscesses developed in Katy.
She has a vagina in her body but has no uterine or dimples.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and resides in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is obese, she hopes to adopt or become a mother through a stationary surrogacy.
"""This law allows parents not to make their own decisions in a hurry,"" he said."
It gives them time to understand and appropriately by some test before writing ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you're okay - raise the baby, love the baby.
You have a lovely child and have fun with it.
We do not need to do such medical treatments in a hurry that cannot be returned to us.
"It brings the children into the decision-making process and frees the parents from the distress that inspires them because they don't believe they are doing well,"" he said."
In the end, the child will determine which sex he is more comfortable with - and that will be a very good thing.
This enables children to make their own decisions on their own.
The Legal Awareness Camp was held on behalf of the Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar and chaired by All-Judge Sandeep Kaur at the Ramnagar Middle School Dalher.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the right to education and financially disadvantaged persons.
Advocate ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch made people aware of the matter at the camp.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama quietly considered Hillary Clinton for a ticket for 2012 to replace Biden for taking the vice-presidential position.
The most notable explosion in the mystery is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down : Change the Game 2012" by Mark Halperin and John Helemann.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and told on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had been holding "wide-group polls and polling in late 2011". Obama's re-election may fall in hopes of what dumping
According to the Times National Political Journalist Jonathan Martin, the book provides full information about the efforts made in the chief officer's campaign and the White House, named after the former White House chief of staff, put on a bill to replace the White House chief of staff.
The possible switch was a very safe secret within the basic structure of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pouluffe – were under consideration.
The "double down" claims that Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal balance before finally making the decision when his information was telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's status.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I looked at the whole scene and said, and one of them, it was," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember that at the time the president's office was in danger so we were in a situation like this, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dale described the research as "precautionary," Martin had told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made a significant investment in finding out how much this claim would pay off on being a poll.
"The campaign doesn't spend on voting and focus groups like money until they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, Halaki, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked the pitcher if his boss knew about a possible reversal?
While Dale said he "didn't think the president knew about the possible change," the former chief of staff thought it was "possible" that it knew Obama.
"Double Down" Definitely: Will not answer whether political inquiry reached Obama's desk? Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin if he was serious about the Obama Biden Dumping ticket research he had thought about.
"Perhaps," Martin said.
Do you like ice-cream in the dark?
A British businessman has created the world's first glo-in-di-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
"Charlie Francis has benefited a lot of sea animals to develop the best breakfasts,"" he said."
He came up with this idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and China's confident scientists made use of chemical fluorescence on the re-examination of proteins.
The ice cream, which will increase the pH level of the protein by reacting with the tongue, and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that the ice cream is illuminated by reacting with the heat of the mouth, i.e. the more the win will be, the more it will be illuminated.
Charlie, founder of I.M. Delisias Ice Cream, said: “This is an incredible thing, but the early days’ production will get me about 2 grams of stuff from <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The proteins we are using in the ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth warms, the protein pH levels will increase and the ice cream will glow.
We've been experimenting for the last few months and it feels perfectly right to share it on Halloween because it gives an amazing glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the brilliance of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, the taste of isca is very good.
The experimental company based in Charlie's Bristol is famous for its unusual flavor, including beer, pepper, meat and golden leaf apnea.
But his next creation is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
"I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream," he said.
It’s naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the aperture above the ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do it.
The ice cream is useful for the detrimental properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The Rani Bag market was full-fledged with customers.
It was recently that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy beans.
It was recently held in the central markets of Vazirpur, Awantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
Some of the same sights have also been seen in the shops of model town of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar and Sarrafa.
Here, too, people were buying gold and silver jewels and coins.
As a result, other markets, including the outer ring road, were jammed.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in the jam to get home.
Halloween 2013: by Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up for the neighborhood to play.
Today, I've become more of a fan.
I didn't even sign in to get Candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably won't be this year.
But there's evidence that there's a black sheep in the halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween at $158 million this time., $6.9 billion will be spent on candy and clothing and decorations.
One of the things I've always seen is all the hallucinations of Halloween.
According to the NRF, the total cost of clothing is estimated at $6.9 billion.
This year, everyone is angry with the inanimate objects.
Women don't have to be lazy, because it's a sexy food with jasse pizza, hamburgers, and carrots.
A lot of zombies hoping for Mordo, and thanks to the moving space of the Dead, will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after outfits will be zombies, batmans, rogues and squirrels.
I don't think there's anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we wore a dog outfit and surprisingly, we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend $330 million on pet clothing.
This is the reason why there are a lot of hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to the Nelsen company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairy Bars, Lollipops, Milk Dolls, Twisters and Clark Bar are around <0xC2><0xA3>600 million.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is good news that 41 million trucks are taking part in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we, and what's fun, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confessors Association, one thing we will not use during Halloween is candycorn, but it also sells for about <0xC2><0xA3>35 million.
It is about the personal wealth of Macca 9 billion.
It's a mystery. So far to solve
There is nothing more important than the basic halloween bhutia home.
They are best known as, "The Terror Behind the Wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Chikh-o-Chikh" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to the U.S. government, there are 1200 officially approved ghost homes in the United States that generate 500 million revenues. And that's a terrifyingly good picture that you make of your friend Faker and look at your Facebook and he's your favorite.
Finally, let's talk about Kado.

The dream of smugglers to trade in the Patakha market in the transport area was not realized.
Patakha traders have been trapped in Maddar after the order of the High Court.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary patchha market created in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been licensed to do business in the transport area.
The commission set up by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary patchha market at Ranjit Avenue unsafe.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar also fined Rs 10 lakh for not having proper management there.
The High Court, in its order, has aggrieved the administrative officials of Amritsar, saying what kind of administration could not solve even a problem of smuggled traders for nine years.
They could not be made available the right place in the city.
Subsequently, appropriate security management was asked to issue a license for the business in the market located in Jahazgarh.
Even after the order, Patakha traders were happy, but on their happiness, the police handed back water on Friday.
The real license team of the police branch reached the Patakha market and sold the form by placing a counter on it.
After that, it was impossible to meet the conditions they were told in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind and Arun Sharma Patakha reached the market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the management carried out by patakha traders.
Therefore, no licenses have been issued to the smugglers.
Diwali has one day left.
As a result, the trader is in trouble.
He is facing a loss of Rs 1 crore.
Patakha traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desaraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said they will sue the district administration if they lose Rs crores.
Angry Patakha traders took out the Angry March from Jahazgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
The protests against the police and the district administration.
Subsequently, the temporary patchha market, which is running at Ranjit Avenue, was also shut down.
A fire brigade was called to rescue a missing pope at the foot of a mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cockroach Spaniel Ruby ran away after getting into a small road collision
He was seen by a dog walker trapped in a mine three days later.
Firefighters took down the front part of the rock from the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After being trapped on the slopes of some 50 feet above the ground by Pope, the firefighters were called to him for a happy life.
Nine-month-old Cockroach Spaniel Ruby ran away after coming into a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Elderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denham, were in the Flippit mine in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and he was in the Flippit mine.
After a minor accident, after he left, he had gone crazy for his lost dog, and an appeal had been posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a fast-looking dock walker spotted Ruby, at an altitude of 50 feet from the ground, on a mountain in the mine.
A technical rescue team arrived at the scene from the Cliqueton Fire Station and descended by the rope to save Ruby and used a stomach tube to bring him down from the rock.
"Technical defence officer Andy Clatton said: ""He was in a difficult situation."
It was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet up and down.
He did not kill a single one during the rescue, he had become a stone.
But now he is good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It is unbelievable to see the dog.
Special Technical Defence Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived in a lucky way."
He was likely to be seriously injured or even more likely to be in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be well in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see rescue work."
At first, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It's amazing to have him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she got too tired and fell down, she would definitely fall down.
The firefighters did a very good job.
What he has done is a very courageous work.
We were so proud of them, and they were all the best.
Mr. Alderson also told Kegley: "We were afraid she might fall, but she was there."
The firefighters did a great job.
I can’t believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says when Katy Perry was 18, she didn't hit her
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pan Star said he had sung backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with senior rocker, and ‘when I was 18, he hit me.’
"It's old, and he treats me well,"" he said."
The 70-year-old Jagger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies about ever beating Katy Parry."
The spokesperson also said: "Perhaps Pari is talking about them in someone else's misconception."
Parry was one of the singers to come as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prizm" reached the top spot this week.
Georges Kerevan: The European Union has given the Scots an option
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that an independent Scotland will be required to be included as a free travel zone throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the barrack, the passport controls and stories about the boundary of the cantilever wire on the walls of Hydrian indicate.
It is true that the Strathclyde Paper described the potential economic benefits of free circulation with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
No one has described that E.U. members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shawnee area, so Brussels will be an affordable discount for continual non-compliance for Brussels instead of getting what they really want from Scotland.
So, then, a-hack.
And the thing that's been stuck for so long has been stuck. First I heard the bubonic news about 40 years ago that "freedom means passport control."
Still, the interesting point in hearing this old story was lost again.
Why should we expect to bidding Europe from an independent Scotland, after all?
Why do you want to buy and sell London's yachts, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The grand, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died out.
Throughout the E.U., dedicated parties are gaining strength to oppose the E.U. or to shut down the euro as an equal currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly came and received about fifty lakh votes in the federal elections in September. The Congress of the European People's Party (EPP) received about 50 lakh votes in the Parliamentary Assembly, and thus the Free Democrats (Democrats).
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be fundamentally transformative.
As well as the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think that the project Europe has gone a long way due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not have much role to play in the excessive budget deficit of the national governments – it was only true in the case of Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has stabilized its members at the exchange rate in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a position of inherently detrimental to productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce wages and public expenditures - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European productivity amidst the current budgets and currency problems, the report said.
To provide exemptions to French and German energy firms at the expense of consumers - as a result of the "exhausted" energy policies imposed by Brussels, the European industry is doing more than double the GDP of the United Nations for electricity and gas.
It's a huge cost loss that we've seen in Grungemouth.
Despite freezing all wages in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be spared from being affected by cheap U.S. shell gas.
As a result, a sense of rebellion has been aroused in the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the E.U. as a means to keep Germany under control, and to provide Paris with billing equal to Wansigatton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing France’s economy to dwindle.
Result: The U.S.-backed National Front of South Africa (U.S.) has won by pushing the ruling socialist in third place in the recent by-election.
At the moment, the Front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it is a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot proceed by assuming that the dissolution for the left, will itself benefit for the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with his newfound fame among the French blonde, working class?
The party wants to make use of next year's EU elections in the European Parliament anti-EU, the highest anti-currency alliance.
If, as is very likely, the anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a coup could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: soon the union of anti-EU and anti-exchange sentiments in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not be completely over, but it will come back in a way that will be backed by General de Gaulle as the “Europe of the Nations.”
Germany and some of its unconventional economies may maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect that the U.K. will keep itself away from this project in the hopes of increasing closeness with the U.S.
However, the growing interest in the Pacific in Vanshigatan indicates that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What's next for Scotland in the future?
We can choose to stay in the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to be different at the right time, and that's what we're doing.
I think that Scotland can do better in a loose European system of action-implementation, provided that we keep our own currency.
It will be easier to work together with other countries with similar thinking in non-federal nations in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic freedom while walking the way of Norway, he said.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful mitigation-anti-political campaign in Europe, which was proposed by Labour Chancellor Elistier Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk Atatürk 2011
It would be foolish to vote for freedom for Scotland at this time, as in that situation it would have to accept the rules of mitigation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Youth Before Time: Growing Up Quickly
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get youth at a younger age than girls of their own age, according to the study.
Physical change doesn't mean that youth is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed.
Experts believe that stuttering rash, may be a cause of adolescence at a young age
The case of pre-teens is not as effective in boys
Pat Etheriz, a former C.N.N. journalist, is an expert on children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried, if her daughter starts to develop breasts at the age of 7 or 8 years and the hair of the baby begins to grow out?
This week at the annual conference of the U.S. Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a Pediatric Endocrinologist, clarified that these are the initial physical changes in the U.S. girls.
Caplovich says, "I spend a lot of time trusting parents - that it generally doesn't show a steady progress towards full youth," he said.
Direct symptoms of development such as sneezing of the breasts, pubic hair and nails, and physical odor have been seen in girls for a long time.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very minor change in the age of Razodarshan (first menstrual-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
"When the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first rash to develop," says Caplovitz, who is also the author of "Time-Pre-Teenager in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is the time.
What is the beginning of adolescence is debated, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, two call it "child-adult".
In most cases, the process will be slowed down or stopped - which can be closely monitored by a pediatrician.
An examination by an endocrinologist may be required in the event of more severe progression in order to eliminate the possibility of serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
Premature menstrual-religion and other outcomes are treatments to delay: premature age-increase of the limbs, which may cause undeveloped growth and numbness as adults.
The compositions for the drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of increase, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are important as well.
Caplowitz is concerned about drugs but admits, "Pressing a teenager can increase managerial issues, and girls may start to feel different from their peers."
Another big problem can be understood: parents just don’t want their underage daughter to be menstrual-religious.
Caplovitz said, "They're worried about the risk of pregnancy, or how they'll maintain cleanliness."
A woman, whose daughter had started the monthly religion at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we had also talked about menstrual-religion, she was not emotionally prepared.
He was afraid of his school and upset that he had started the first monthly religion in his lifeguards.
There are many prevalent theories about the causes of asymmetry youth.
Still, there is no continuing evidence that sexual messages in the environment, in the environment, in the milk or other foodstuffs could be accused of being sexually transmitted.
Boys - just like girls - are getting pre-teens too.
Caplovites lay down the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of stagnation.
She helped conduct studies on girls aged 6 to 9 in the year 2001, which combines body fat with adolescence time.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it as well.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get teens before their age for blonde girls.
There are many explanations for this.
At the global level, the time-previous youth pattern, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although the boy's face and genital hair are getting at a young age, but the course of the teenager is not as clear as the girls.
Other physicians present at the A.A.P. Conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see facial and genital hair.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician at the Goreeb Childrene Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says, “We need to be careful about it as we do.” We need to be careful about the real early stages of youth.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their pediatrician to get an opinion on how to talk to their children.
Caplovich advised, "This may mean that we can have a conversation before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
It is necessary to have the confidence of pre-developing girls that even if this is happening before the time but it is part of normal life.

There's a lot of controversy about the seat width on the big orders of the jet manufacturers.
A hurdle has been set up to fight for this month's Dubai eruption, while the width of the tourist-class seats for long-haul flights among the leading aircraft manufacturers
Controversy is centered on the width of the seat of the Economy class in long-haul aircraft, not always as provided by airlines, but whose oriented location is the efficiency. The latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Corporation
The Airbus is hoping to give an extended seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin this week but this should be decided by the airlines, according to its head-counterweight Boeing.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when a large version of the long-distance aircraft's twin engine of the long-distance aircraft began to be sold in a probable order after the 17-21 incident.
How is the previous department of the aircraft created - especially whether the seating 9 or 10 is equal to the more-capacity demands being made with the design of the mini jets?
Boeing says it has created the "777 X" which will put 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a single line.
The Airbus said it would take 350 people to a seat equal to 9 inches left 18 inches while hovering with the A350.
Aircraft tycoons often engage in trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, the Airbus 777 X is hoping to take the lead on more than 100 orders in the Dubai Arsho, so appealing to the public ahead.
Recently it is being seen that the beginning of the Vigilance War is something that is happening to Finnsero showing it all three together in a restaurant Would you accept it?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said: "The Boeing regional turbo is also offering long-haul flights to the Sanctuaries."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way the plane sits doesn't change.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when Boeing 747 Jimbo ne defined modern long-term travel tha, and the average 40-49-year-old American male ke weight me increased by 10 percent.
According to the U.S. Health Statistics, the average American male waist is 39.7 inches in the 21st century.
Airbus says its rival is stuck with a 1950s seat concept when the new name was the average circumference of the "jet set," according to the BBC.
Airbus said it had set up a research commission that suggested an additional inch in width of the seat to improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent, according to the report.
Boeing has disputed the airbus seat measurement data, and has said it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers on how the airlines are balancing between rents and facilities.
It also says, that research shows that depending on the experience of a cabin more than the width of a seat.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver said, "It really tells us what it takes to give airlines the flexibility to do and what they believe they need to do to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us what they're benefiting from."
They know their business better than anyone else's.
It’s about the cockpit room for the pilots, but for suppliers it’s a matter of urgency that it can affect income.
The trade of at least $700 billion behind the dispute is expected to suffice in the coming decades to tip the average of U.S. and European exports, the airline said.
For the first time in July, Kei's seat layout was actually a matter of fighting between new jet planes, Reuters reported.
Airbus and Boeing have claimed a 20 per cent performance per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300R, the leader of that segment in their new twin engine design.
The performance of the Boeing depends on the design of the 10th 777 X Forest Original 9 compared to the 777 design.
The unit cost has now been compared to 10 times the profit in unit cost.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe's airbus passenger facility, said "Boing's plane is doing this to make them more competitive with our products, to occupy more and more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-cet-per-line cabin suggests for the existing 777 S that many passengers are in favor of a denser layout, which can also go with cheap rentals.
Cabin interior expert My Carbi, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network said, "The eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this is a trade point threat by the Airbus proposal 777.
Airbuses and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for the airlines.
Jet sellers from all over the world also take careful measures to check on this layouts competition.
Even more relaxed, all the builders are also providing low-cost aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
The Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but says it is not yet sold.
But until recently, the Airbus has focused on some of its jet aircraft on extensive cabin seats for the need for more cabin facilities.
It is unlikely that a new industry will be flying on the standard without the support of another manufacturer of modern jet aircraft, but it may divert from the wave of sales of the 777 X.
New Anti-Nicotinum Vaccine May End the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can end the fun encountered by smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine, the mice were able to keep safe from nicotine intake for the rest of their lives.
Testing on a human requires further and more testing, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal, a professor at the Cornel Medical College in New York, said the inflammatory signs are positive.
Professor Cornel said, "We are very hopeful that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers who have been in the market for a long time." He said, "With all the methods available in the market today, he has been able to use the smokers.
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to deliver genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotinous antibodys.
This virus, selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibody.
Antibodies detect any nicotine nuclei in the blood, and prevent the rise of nicotine within the smoker by disabling them before they reach the brain.
In the test, the vaccines were given to rats who were given nicotine later on, they continued to do their normal activities.
The researchers say that but the mice that were not given the vaccine "liked it", it was a sign that nicotine had reached her brain.
This experiment was described in a journal called Science Transcendental Medicine, which was published in the journal Science Transcendental Medicine.
The vaccines of the former tobacco had failed because they had antibodies in them.
It had to be dosed at regular intervals, so that the level of antibody remained, but it proved expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver will make the cell an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future was completely safe, it could be given to children before smoking cigarettes, so that they could be saved from nicotine poisoning.
But it is likely that it will be used by people who smoke to quit smoking.
"They'll find that if they start smoking again, they won't be able to enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists found the results interesting, but cautioned against the need for too much research to be done.
Even after the post-mortem, the real cause of the death of the tiger could not be recovered.
The Department of Forestry, while responding to Golmol in this regard, is making the death of first-sighted Baghin a natural occurrence.
On Thursday night, forest workers from the Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tiger near the Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Kicheri Nale.
All the bodies of the tiger were safe and there were no signs of injuries or injuries etc.
In the presence of Forest Conservator Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR, Saket Badola, DFO Kakasha Nasim, SDO GS Karki, Veterinary Director of CTR, Pom Khanat and Kotabag, Veterinary Doctor Hema Rathore
According to sources, the tiger's antarctic body is said to be damaged during post-mortem.
This did not reveal the real cause of death of the tiger.
Department officials responded to the death of Baghin Golmal.
However, the tiger's antarctic organs have been sent to the IVRI barelli for a toppsychological examination to confirm the poison.
Wildlife conservationist Vivek Pandey said that the death of Baghin could be called natural.
There are no symptoms of poisoning from the body of the tiger, etc.
Yet for this, it is sending a bizarre investigation to confirm the poison as well as a search for the surrounding area.
We refuse to be impacted by Tripod Obaid.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joa Tripodi will be scrutinized by State Corpsan Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joa Tripodi has refused to deny the policy at the request of his political guru AD Obaid, former New South Wales conservator AD Obaid, whose government-controlled three lands are overrun by the state.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) detailed its investigation on Friday that, what did Mr. Obi-Wan have to do with the violation of the Parvi strips of policy from several ministers after? Where did the two restaurants and cafes owned by the Obi-Wan in 2005 at the time of the Samati Kei?
The evidence given on Thursday by Lynn Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, was now being investigated for the covert selfishness of the charge of Shri Tripodi Shri Obaid.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had put pressure on the launch of public tenders for strips.
The tenants were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the Circular's Entrance for Loans, which led to Obi-Wan earnings of $2.5 million a year, was reinstated from the Loans-Free Tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Gardens from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the Public Tender.
But he refused for the change at the request of Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi had called for a change in the government mortgage policy
Copy presented in a telephone call in the ICAC in August and September 2007 Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dun, a senior official who had come to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obid after working in the Ministry of Ports
The Assistant Commissioner, Anthony Whealy, asked Mr Tripodi, "Was the development of commercial mortgage policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," Mr. Tripod replied.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn’t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obi-Wan.
Officials say that Israeli fighter jets have called the run in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to the Fox News.
The officer did not say what the goal was, but there was at least one goal there.
According to an Associated Press report, the Targat was a Russian S.A.-125 missile.
Israel has failed to launch airstrikes on missiles within Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass the "certificate" test
A "certificate" test for foreign employees on 457 visas is being considered by the government, as its purpose is to extend a rigorous procedure.
If this test is adopted, it will be implemented by means of a standard created to prevent the 457 being used to fill in incompetent positions in Australia or to reach family and friends in a precautionary manner.
A government letter of discussion was issued today, condemning the government's motto on foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine MacQue said today that it could wreak havoc on Australia's neighbouring countries.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreign people are reaching the end of Qatar" and the strong statement about "Australian people first to work" is a very unpleasant repetition at such a time. Hue is a very unfavorable repetition, while the Unions are a safe haven.
Historically, it meant that protection should have been provided to the white workers – and if some people in the area had seen the echo of that historical evidence, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion letter outlines 12 measures, which were first considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about the people who were kidnapping, has implemented five substantive changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "certificate" criterion is adopted, the examination of the visa applicant may be carried out as to whether "the enrolment is true in circumstances in which the enlisted person, the co-sponsor of the visa is the owner or the relevant person concerned.
Businesses may need to count the number of 457 visa holders, as the former businessmen who wanted to sponsor fewer employees, hired hundreds of people to work.
During this, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee ship on Christmas Island this week.
The man's roughly nine-year-old son had come on a trip to Australia with him, and on Wednesday, after his father's death, his adult stepbrother has tied a rope that was on the same boat.
Australian officials have taken the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he was found dead, according to a statement from the BBC.
A study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's profits from the HS2 rail project.
The work by HS2 points to high-speed services in Scotland and the north of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barrones Kremer said the project will "become one for the UK."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are very "enthusiastic" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and the Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was in talks with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider rail capacity for the north of England and Scotland and the prospects of improving the time of travel.
This includes the possibility of three hours or less of possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Barones Kremer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving forward with HS2, as it will have a lot of benefits.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be more well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Ellister Carmichael, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael to return Scotland to the HS2 network for a "clear" return.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail is likely to have a huge economic advantage for Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail across the UK.
So we are excited to work with the British government to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create profits for all, and complete the Glasgow-Edinburgh line. This is the first time the government has been able to explore the options that it has created, whose scooter
I am ready to review the inquiry report with the ministers of the British Government next year and to take a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Rules Will Be Effective Now In Australia
The device-related regulations in the U.S. will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones while Australian airline passengers are boarding, while boarding and boarding the aircraft.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left open the option to U.S. Air Service companies to change their processes, so that passengers can read e-books during the important stages of the flight. Read the e-book in the magazines, watch the videos or play games on their devices.
Passengers can still do this during a lot of flights, but many people don’t like to be unable to fill in and access their e-books while boarding the plane, etc.
Australian air service companies are considering the decision that US air service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have an immediate plan to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but stressed that the ban on the use of electrical equipment in important phases of flight in Australia is still effective.
"Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulations governing the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the Authority said, "This issue comes under the regulations, according to which the aircraft service operators must ensure that the aircraft is in compliance with the regulations, or in accordance with the regulations in which the aircraft is to be transported, the air service operators must ensure that the safety
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but asked to take further action at the direction of the wingman.
The spokesperson said, "We will welcome the review by CASA in case the use of electrical appliances is allowed, because we really feel that it will provide a better experience to customers. In the meantime, because we now have (wireless input)
Quantas said that it will comply with the current rules at the moment.
"We do not have any immediate plan to use electrical appliances during the filling and landing of flights as per our current policy, and we have no immediate plan to change it," he said.
The FAA Decisions apply to U.S. Allergy Lines.
By the way, we’re always interested in exciting developments that can benefit passengers and we’ll certainly consider the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each U.S. Airline service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio decorating from mobile devices, as well as they have their own rules books, training materials, Carry-on Baggage program and brief delivery to passengers.
The FAA said that "after verifying the tolerability of their aircraft by the airlines, it will use lightweight electrical appliances such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones that hold passengers at all heights."
In rare cases of low visibility, the driver will instruct the passengers to turn off their equipment during the landing of the aircraft.
The group has also suggested that the heavy equipment should be safely kept under the seat or in the upper compartments during the flight and landings.
Ponbrokers' silver due to being made difficult by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirathlinga is taking cash in her gold chips, rings and chips to pay for her daughter's school fees at the Ponshop at the Bendemier Shopping Centre in Singapore.
"""My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it,"" Ms. Amirathlinga said."
She says that although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also works, but the family’s monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic debt is growing - the volumes where they are doing their transactions, this week, the third-placed exchange listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Keeping the jewel down is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirathlinga, $1,300 Singapore Dollars - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Generally, Ponbroker takes interest at 17 per cent per annum in Singapore, slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, ponbrokers have the advantage of not having to have a credit check or proof of pay, and they can provide loans more quickly than the bank does.
Millions of people in the sector are taking a stand for Ponshop due to rising living expenses and rising domestic and consumer loans, the report said.
Strong growth for up to five years after the global financial disaster, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, due to the slowdown in their economies, families with low and middle incomes are able to meet their own needs.
This week, the rating agency, Standard Angels Powers, described domestic profits as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks, mainly due to rising mortgages (mortgages).
He said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to domestic debt.
With 80 per cent of GDP, Malaysia is at the top of the list, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer loans in Thailand, which have emerged slightly from this week's technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a steady decline in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
In Malaysian Bank, CIMB economist Sang Seung Wun said, "The decisive point is that, with rising prices, [income scale] will come in the middle. People who come in the lower category will increase their income as much as possible."
The historically high prices in gold prices over the past two years have inspired people to keep their personal belongings down, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to value their family’s jewellery.
70 per cent of the gold deposited in the city-state 200-pound outlet in Singapore is gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold looks good, let's keep Grandma's gold chain down, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest pan-shop manager, Ejimni, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using his outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the holding business that outlet manager Valumax in Bendimer and 15 others like it in Singapore, not only in their neighbours, but also in the neighbouring countries, are planning to expand the works in Malaysia, where there are four stores.
The company will use 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received this week in listings on the Singapore Stock Exchange, financed by the company.
While some discount lenders (creditors) have been criticised due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that holding the depreciation is not only at a cheaper rate than other lenders. It is not only in growth, but also directly in growth.
They say, “Customers hold down items that they already have, and depreciating personal properties doesn’t increase in domestic debt,” he said.
The social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing in order to obtain short-term and secure financial assistance.
It’s not that Ponbrokers are only used by financially weak individuals.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax Outlet, they hold down gold bars or Rolex cases so that up to 60 per cent of their purchase price can be paid in cash.
We have customers from all walks of life in our community.
Ms. Yah says, "These include wealthy individuals who need a loan for a short period of time for a business venture or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements."
Sometimes they only need money in a very short amount of time.
India's biggest businessman, Mukesh Ambani, says his wife, Nita Ambani, is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He held a very big party on the occasion.
Several major stars of Bollywood arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party. In the late evening of October 31, several major stars were seen catching the flight of Jodhpur at Mumbai Airport.
The stars include Karishma Kapoor, Gita Basra, Vinod Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose and others.
Obviously, you can guess how big the gas will be when such a big name will be included in the party.
Tajikistan's $325 million bailout package for health
The Union government has stressed that there are also tough conditions associated with a $325 million bailout package for the Tasmanian health system, which will ensure that the state government does not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that the National Assembly, the island state's elderly population, high rates of glandular diseases, and the current taxation limits are "immediately urgent" to resolve the current crisis.
The financing decision, which was to be made over the course of four years, was made after consultation of the government with Tasmania's independent MP Andru Vilki.
Ms. Plibersek said today, "The government has delivered an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the special challenges faced by the state.
The $ 325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $ 31 million, which is also available in the U.S.
An additional 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic and motiabind surgery, will help resolve the previous collected cases.
It contains a walk-in clinic in Hobart and Lonsestion, better care after leaving the hospital, training of medical specialists, mental health services and local hospitals. Personalized electronic health care in the hospitals of the hospital.
"These investments are in line with the best ways I have been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania,"" Ms. Plibersek said."
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government will face strict reporting and accountability of the government.
The state will have to maintain the current financial-feeding level in order to get the National Assembly funds, and report every month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be formed to ensure that services are provided by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Vilki said that the $325 million would not mean much more so long, "until actual improvements are made to bring the public health system of Tasmania to a more sustainable level."
Yet he praised the Government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they had first brought before the Prime Minister in the beginning of May."
"""I hope that the federal assistance package will prove very helpful in separating the state-run public health system from the crisis-threatened list,"" he said."
According to the State Government, these additional alternative processes will mainly predate the cuts that have been made recently.
But federal opposition health spokesperson Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-ed solution."
"We are here because the Labour State government has taken $430 million in its health care system," he told ABCTV.
You can't think of getting nearly half a billion dollars taken by the state government and giving 300 million dollars by the nationwide as a day with good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plembersek should be given a guarantee that no one of the rescue packages would be spent on additional employment.
Dennis Dederot's novel Gillum Niklaux has the best production design and time period details in the conversion, but it's far more than it should have been.
Reflecting the time of France in 1760, this novel, named Suzanne, tells the sad story of Young Rais, who sends his family member to the Convent.
When she rebels, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the oppressive mother Superior, and becomes the object of sexual attraction for the other.
This movie never goes into sexuality or sensuality - and that's the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the storyline, it also runs the risk of becoming a hilarious film for the audience.
CSA vice president Dr. Munna Singh has decided to impose an entry fee to the garden due to dirt spreading in the garden.
A 15-day ultimatum has been given to repair the dash of the departments.
The vice president conducted an in-depth inspection of the subdirector Seeds & Areas and Directors Research with the Garden Department on Friday at 10 a.m.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees in these departments, including directors, nadarda from his seat.
He also warned that the next time he was found missing, he would cut his salary.
Dr. Naushad Khan, who is in charge of the university's media, said he would have to pay Rs 30 per month for the tour.
People will be able to go to the garden for a fee of one rupee per day.
Work will be done from the system: the files that come before the vice president for various tasks will be accessed under a system.
Not every employee will have the right to be admitted to the office of the vice president with his file.
The relevant officials will reach out to their final vice-chairman.
The monitoring group said that Syria has devastated its ability to build its own chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed essential tools for making chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while fierce fighting has erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the site of the poisoning.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian movement group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's civil war started about three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the last date of November 1.
The organization located in Heg destroyed or "ineffective" the machinery used by the Damascus to collect chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to fill them in war materials. It was used to destroy or "make them ineffective".
Mainly to complete the initial stage of destruction, the stone of a meaningful milestone in this ambitious sequence of events is aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.
Destroying the equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is now believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, which include mastered gas and nerve agent Sirene.
Britain's situation Syrian observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement took place at the time when fighting escalated in the city of Safira on Thursday, about which Kedar Kedar experts believe it was accompanied by chemical weapons production.
The group, which details the number of deaths through the network of the movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that 61,067 common citizens, including 6,365 children, are included.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar Assads are members of the military army, 18,678 fighters fighting for the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead there are 2,202 soldiers and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated that about 100,000 people had died in the fighting since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's military forces had been fighting rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were affiliated with al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people from both sides were injured, but did not say anything clearly.
This war reflects the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons, who, in very short time-limits, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, cooperating with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team is "currently satisfied and it has confirmed - and has seen all the declared important production and mixing/integrating equipment of Syria" - destroyed.
It also said, "No further plan of inspection activity is being made."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they had gone to 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus and completed the first stage of the confirmation work.
The inspectors said they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the O.P.C.W. said that according to Syria, the two centres "have been decommissioned and ... chemical weapons products placed there have been delivered to other declared centres, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira, is one of those two centres, where the O.P.C.W. inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of O.P.C.W. next month.
In the remark issued by O.P.C.W., Ahmed Uzumku, Director General of the Supervising Group, said, "I would like to extend my greetings to the people in fulfilling the most challenging mission done by this organization so far."
This civil war has been going on for three years: mainly the Assad government and its security forces, which emerged from Shia Islam, include members of the White Panth, and the insurrection is a struggle between Sunni Muslims.
Rami Abdurrahman, head of the arsenal, said on Wednesday there had been a massive explosion at the air defense center in the coastal region of Syria.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered copies of photos of the stolen register, stolen masks, laptops and stolen registers from the accused's possession.
The Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that Chandra Nagar's Rajiv Agarwal, Ghumar Mandi's Kamal Krishna Jaswal, Kohara's Gurinder Singh Gaggi and Ghu were among the arrested persons.
Balbir Singh of the Registry Office (Eastern) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and record-keeper Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office, were extracting documents from the records of the empty and old lands and after that, they bought new stamps and made a register on them.
This was not the case, after which the real Registry was erased and uploaded to the Registry record.
Subsequently, the accused sold the land for crores of rupees on paper.
At the same time, they were borrowing on these paperwork.
After that, the real owner of the land was under pressure from the police and administration.
The accused, who was preparing the net register, were keeping a special watch over the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one who oversees the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to sell and prepare the registered register of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said the accused had said in the enquiry that they have so far prepared about 150 jammed registers.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft have been registered against Sargana Rajiv.
Assault on Conspiracy for Bombing in Bali
Families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombings said Omar Patek had to face the firing squad, stressing the sentence given to the suspect in the bomb blast.
Patek, who had been fleeing as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted individuals for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
He can be released in 15 years if he is given parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other terrorism-related allegations, including a series of bomb explosions in a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded the sentence of life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the death penalty of this person, who is called the notorious "destructive person" as the master making the bombs.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of June Cortin, a woman living in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-defendants a decade ago.
Stopping his aspirations, he said Patek should have been given the death penalty.
"I really feel that he should have been punished just like the other brutal terrorists,"" he said."
Ms. Courtin told A.A.P., "She should be placed in front of the firing squad."
"I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, just after 11 p.m., the club's name was removed after a bomb exploded in a stand-alone van outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddle bar just 20 seconds before the bag pack filled with explosives by suicide bombers exploded.
They moved into a month-long coma as a result of this bomb explosion and "died" three times during their stay on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says Patek should have been given the same punishment as three other members of the Islamic terrorist group responsible for the assassination - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Narayan - who died four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of one of the Bali bombers.
He was spared from being arrested for nearly a decade, but finally in January 2011, he was arrested in Abatabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. Army killed former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report revealed that the contacts between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda were to be re-established in Patna in an attempt to meet Bill Ladden
Ms. Cortin says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, he is not really saddened by the fact that so many people are suffering mentally.
The decision came before the 10th anniversary of this year's attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Cortin said, "There will be a lot of tears this year."
Patek may still appeal against his sentence.
F.A.A.: Air passengers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but can't call from cell phone)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music, from entering the gate to the gate. Anwari Prathani Aishan Aishan will not be able to talk to Aishan Aishan on his cellphone - such as on Thursday.
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately, he added.
At a news conference, F.A.A. Administrator Michael Hurta said that no matter how quickly these changes are implemented, it will be different for each airline.
The F.A.A. has to demonstrate how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines, as well as the rules on how to display the guidelines. The conductors of their flight crew members are in the form of training booklets and device collection rules.
The F.A.A. has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted the plans to the airline.
The F.A.A. said in a statement, "Based on the status of the plan, we can approve the extended use of the electronic device very soon.
Currently, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door of the aircraft is closed.
They are expected not to turn them on until they reach an altitude of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to restart their device when they land on the plane, and do not turn it on until the plane has fully landed.
The F.A.A. said, under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic malfunctions are their passengers flying by plane, complying with aircraft landing and sub-devices during taxiing.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria, the report said.
The President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Laura Glading, has welcomed the changes in this regard.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy is implemented in a safe manner - and we will work together with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we're tired of feeling like we're "hall monitors."
But surfing, sharing emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, such as online scribal games, which is associated with the famous incident that when actor Elek Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011, the aircraft from Dina Urahe to Ata Urahman was at the door.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected as they will worry about the other person in the cabin being injured if they go up.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be banned during the flight.
The vignettes related to the phone call are held by the Federal Communications Commission, not by the F.A.A.
F.A.A. may remove restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rozhenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is the national transport safety expert at CBS News, said that the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, but not because they can potentially cause malfunctions in the navigation-related device, but also because they can grow up when they're in the air," Rogenkar said.
To investigate the issue, the Industry World Consultative Committee set up by the F.A.A. last month has submitted that the government should allow more use of the personal electronic device.
Pressure on the F.A.A. to reduce restrictions on their use has been increasing in recent years.
A critic like Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, has said that there is no legitimate reason for the ban.
The introduction of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is all-encompassing.
Some studies also get the indication that nearly a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device, according to the study.
The F.A.A. began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996, when the passengers carried FM radios and high-tech gadgets of the time. The introduction of navigation and communication devices due to the use of pre-electronic gadgets
New airlines are more reliant on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the F.A.A. to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude from passengers for many years.
Modified aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to malfunctions.
Hurta said that most airlines should meet eligibility criteria for the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, and that they should meet the eligibility criteria.
Today's electronic devices emit a lot less power than the electronic devices of the previous generation, and they emit a lot less power than the electronic devices of the previous generation.
For example, e-readers, there is absolutely nomadic transmission during the page redirection.
However, transmissions are stronger when the data is downloaded or sent by the device.
Amazon.com is also among those who are in favor of reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded its entire family of e-readers into the airlines and flew it to test for problems but no such problem was found.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee has expressed the militia-juli sentiments regarding the risks arising from the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Air Passenger Association said that he believes that the malfunction from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said, "There are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device's malfunctioning in the aircraft system, most of which are very old."
However, the members of the committee submitted that the F.A.A. Pilot was allowed to order the passengers to shut off the device when the plane landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and they are said to be a common knowledge facility for people who are travelling in the latest phases of technology.
"We are pleased that the F.A.A. is aware that travelling with pleasure is not inconsistent with travel, rescue and security,"" said Roger Do, C.E.O. of the U.S. Travel Association."
Learning from the slylewar bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police has tightened their belts for quick reaction during Diwali's arrest in view of security and during that time of emergency.
A total of 1,800 troops will be deployed in all the main areas of the city, crowd-struck markets, to prevent traffic jams, to prevent traffic jams, to prevent other incidents, including teaching the traffic jams.
These youths will include female policemen, including PCRs, traffic units, and policemen.
The city will also conduct a duty-tax check on other places, including hotels, guest houses and PG, with police and commando vigilance.
The SHO has directed the establishment of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) for the investigation of the cases.
The DSP, including the Inspector, has also been given the responsibility of inspecting the markets, malls and other places including the VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the Diwali festival, the senior officials have also set the duty of additional police personnel in police control in view of the sanctity of the people.
In addition to Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH management, the Police placed high alerts to the staff of other Dispensers, including Director of Emergency Department and PGI, Principal Director and DHS.
To teach lessons to the clerks, department officials have now imposed on duty the name 'Anti Gunda Staff' under the leadership of the NGO, including female police personnel.
The policemen of the anti-Gunda staff team will smash the mobs in crowded places, including markets, in plain clothes.
All SHOs have been ordered to put 44 noses on Diwali in the inner areas of the city.
Police personnel will also be detained at 38 naka points on the city's borders.
Bird left back in the jungle by air for safety from North C rig
The bird found stranded on the North C Oil rig has been left back from the coast by air transport.
The bird named this water rail was sent by the Scottish SPCA to the rescue center of their Aloe before being recovered by the helicopter.
"This water rail was probably a winter migrant bird from northern Europe, which came in a gust of strong winds over the North Sea," said Colin Seden, the central manager.
It seems that the bird was tired and he took refuge on the oil rig.
He further said: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
Before leaving, the water rails had become healthier and more resilient.
Is Europe's top class ready to do business with the UK?
In April, Business for the UK was launched and it was promised to bring the business together and determine what changes we would like to see in our relationship with U.K.'s employment and prosperity maker U.U.
For that, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of the UK’s business leaders and asked them what their views were about the UK’s business with the EU.
U-Gov has given the idea of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be astonishing to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on those countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming immobile.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to be confused with the long-term and vicious process of reforming the EU's secret institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas such as product regulation to the law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster, he said.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels, being part of the European commercial sector, is far more than the perks of being part of the European business sector. From the per capita to the per-capita to the per-capita, the per-capita to the per-capita to the per-capita, even the vast business to the per-capita.
Finally, and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants to grow in the direction of trade-based relations and treaty change with the UK, E.U., rather than through politics.
This conclusion, seen at the levels of the major business groups, showed that the business is inspiring towards a "significant change" that will give the U.K. back its lost power.
It has a very high price - the issue of treaty change for the UK and getting a better deal changed in the vote-not-conflict, 16 per cent of the vote in favour of sticking in the EU.
The prime minister should not be in any doubt: it is a survey opportunity that UK businessmen, EU support his plan to negotiate the terms of the UK's membership in the EU.
It also showed that the business, current power balance expects to be re-reacted by making a meaningful change in favour of the U.K.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming mandatory very quickly, as progress is being made in the direction of the eurozone, the contiguous economy, and the Fiscal Union.
Priority should be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that it means a new focus on business for the business. In the regulatory process of Brussels, a new focus is on the business.
Gazprom's Alexi Miller announces the start of a new round of pipelines in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said that the start of the construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today there has been a historic event: the construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline has begun, which is the largest and most important project in Europe.” This is in Eksanko, President of Gazprom, Alex Mihl.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will provide a variety of export routes to Russia in Europe.
The officials said, that Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is part of Europe, poses a risk to the traditional routes in a dispute between the gas-promote counterpart and the contract between the gas-promo.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the geo-political risks associated with transiting countries "forever"," he said.
After the start of the entire project in 2015, the Bulgarian customer will receive gas at the discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said that by the end of the year, construction should begin in other downstream countries.
The pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion dense feet of natural gas, the company said.

Ahead of the allegations against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission has heard allegations of sexual offences against two employees of the YMCA.
Two employees of Y.M.C.A.N.S.W. have been charged with sexual offences before being charged against Karingbah Child Care Officer Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in a statement before the Commission, it said it had "never encountered a case of child sexual harassment within its organization," the Commission said.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case in which an employee of Y.M.C.A. was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in the same year in which Y.M.C.A. Caringbah Jim Inst.
He was aware of the first case, but did not know about the second case, the Commission's assistant lawyer, Gayle Farnes, said.
He also admitted that the statement of Y.M.C.A. before the Commission that "external investigation of Y.M.C.A. has been conducted and he has found Y.M.C.A. the most advanced in the matter of child safety" is also not accurate.
The evidence before the Commission is that the Y.M.C.A. was notified, and it obtained the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August of this year.
Mr. Green, who is 21 years old associated with YMCA, admitted that because of the appointment of the Lord the "self including me" distribution has failed, and it has failed to ensure that the employees in the constituency have failed to comply with the violations of the Child Security Policy
At the beginning of this year, the Lord was found guilty of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year term in the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Green rejected the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, as a result of which the employees did not report a violation of child safety by the lord.
What the employees saw about the violation, gave evidence in which the Lord spent time alone with the children, doing them privately babysitting, letting them sit on the floor, telling them that he loves them and that he loves them all.
Daniel Oakwell, who was in the custody of the Lord, and who had spoken for the child safety training, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the "Y.M.C. CaringBah, who oversees the Lord, was in the custody of the Lord."
C.E.O. stated that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not easy to give information above their employer.
He said, instead, his friendship with the Lord had misled his decision to inform about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided his view to Y.M.C.A.N.S.W. Mandal that the text for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord Event" was "about not giving notice".
Mr. Hare said that the decision of the employees to sign the confidentiality agreement was made by the CMCA's Child Services Manager Liam Whitele as soon as the charges were made.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the interference of evidence, but it was not "extraordinarily" and properly executed.
Stephen Smalbon, Special Professor of Child Sexual Exploitation at Griffith University, said that the Y.M.C.A.N.S.W. was not a safe organization while staying on the job of the Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, supervision, entry, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20.
Blair says he wants to go back to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like the chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview on the evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blayer expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After a decade of resignation as a leader in June 2007, most of his remarks limited to his role as the representative of foreign affairs and Middle Eastern group peace founders. Mr. Blayer to discuss British politics from Kafi
Asked if they would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by the London Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the trading community after the financial crisis, he said.
When a crowd of experts were recruited to perform horses for the best horse of the year in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school yet and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his paulette Shetland tattooed Toffee very easily completed three stages and received the top prize of the year - he reached his 30th birthday.
At the annual competition held by the Sunnyback Equiestrian Center in Rudri, near Cardiff, the indistinguishable pair - which has been the same length as Sk - was highly praised for its display, behavior and style.
In front of the men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, he rolled his flat hat at a sharp angle and shoved his two-year-old toffee into the ring.
The decision makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control that is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest scores for his performance and personality.
Fenton was given Toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March, and he has been practicing with this tattoo of Shetland every day since.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and toffee are a great pair."
He had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but they both won the Gold Cup and Rojet.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy about his victory.
The most distinct in this colorful terrain, he seemed so amazing to everyone that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This young boy from the village of Nanteglo, near Abwell, South Wales, has been walking on the heels of his aunt Sharon Hovells who have been performing horses for more than 10 years.
"The whole place was filled with excitement, and everyone was enjoying the joy and playing the game,"" Ms. Howells said."
He was running on a bale all over the colorful terrain, and despite being so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is the goddess of animals - he loves horses, tractors, and fields very much, and he has got two bugs that he takes care of.
The kind he started, he's going to be in the best horse show of the year long ago - and I'm sure he's going to perform very well.
A spokesperson for the annual Horse Show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his tits."
They are a very good couple.
The decision-makers gave scores considering the manner in which Fenton and Toffee performed and the manner in which they were presented in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between Tattu and his rider - in this case, Fentan and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m absolutely convinced that Fenton’s beloved clothes have helped her, she was really looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper that filed the suit will be "resurrection"
A Chinese newspaper that had made an appeal on the front page to leave a reporter guilty of defamation would be reinstated, a press secretary said.
Guangzhou's newspaper New Express had filed a serious public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongjoo.
But thereafter, Mr. Chen admitted on television that, he had resigned himself to write horrendous news about the state-owned company.
Viniamak said that the new Express now has to undergo a "complete improvement."
The order for "improvement" came from the Gwangdong press and publication, radio, film and television administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had printed a lot of fake news about the listed company Jumluon during the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
Viniamak said in a statement that "the editorial distribution of New Express was disordered."
He said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking the license of the reporter of Chen Yongjou."
"Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for it in the New Express, and to immediately amend the leadership team of the New Express," it said.
Mr. Chen had written many articles in New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Jumlaun.
After being challenged, his newspaper published a two-page appeal for his release, stating that he supports the journalism of Mr. Chen.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to state television, agreed to write and publish false stories for money.
"""In this case, I have damaged Jumaloyan as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people,"" he told State Broadcaster CTV."
I did it mainly because I was in the mood for money and fame.
I have come to realize my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a homepage apology stating that it had failed to properly examine his report.
A lot of high-profile suspects have recently admitted the faults broadcast by TVs.
Experts say the convictions are vigorously admitted from time to time, despite the fact that a law in the latter part of this year had barred officials from obliging a person to hold himself guilty.

U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel has found its own railroad
One of the most complex drug-trafficking tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, including its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. judges have described the four-foot-thirty-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the same length as the six-football pitch, which connects Tijuana, near the warehouse and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is packed with one-of-a-kind warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said it had been discontinued prior to passing any drugs from the tunnel.
According to the records of the Court, the officials have confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three persons, about whom officials said they were working as a driver, were accused of being kept Marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment from 10 years in prison to 10 years in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, ponds and huge underground water drainage streams take advantage of this.
This tunnel is the eighth major route to be found in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the Marijuana crop in central Mexico, which enable drug mafia groups to present the challenge of how they can quickly reach the product to consumers. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The British police have sent an extradition notice to Assange.
The British police sent a delivery notice to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scottland Yard said he had sent a "disclosure notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to be present at the police station, as well as saying that he would be arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden as a result of sexual offences charges, as well as his options under British law were terminated at the time while the Supreme Court has ruled against the extradition at the beginning of this month.
Stockham will take them to the U.S., out of fear he had called on the South American country for political asylum, on June 19 to request asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
A spokesperson said that Scotland Yard "has sent 40-year-old Assange a surrender notice for which he was required to be present at the police station on the date and time chosen by us."
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notices being issued.
Assange fears that more than 250,000 U.S. political cables will be released on a privacy-fighting website called WikiLeaks, and that the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face potential spying charges.

Scientists have also shed some light on the relationship between the dog's tail and its mood.
Recent research has shown that happy dogs sway their dog more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while unsuspecting dogs sway their dog more to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle difference in the tail and can express their reaction to it.
The study has been published in the Journal of Current Biology.
Professor of Neuroscience from the University of Trento, Georgia Wellertigra, said: "In humans, it is all well known that the left and right spinal cords of the brain. The right spinal cord is involved in that stimulation in different ways.
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He said that like humans, the right part of the brain in dogs was also responsible for left-hand movements and the opposite order, and the two pellets played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one-sided squirrels by other dogs, the researchers looked at the animals while watching other dogs' films.
He measured the heartbeats of the pet dogs and analyzed their behaviors.
We probably won’t take more time to understand why their dummies sometimes swing on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Wellertigra said: "We presented dogs with dog movies - to deal with other issues that could be put in the realistic version or in confusion. There were shadow-pictures in the pros." And we could see the heroism of the quest more, and ask questions.
When the animals saw an emotionless dog swaying his tail to the right (from the dog's view), they were completely at ease.
But when they saw the tail shifting mainly to the left (again from the dog's view), their heartbeat increased and they looked unsteady.
According to Prof. Wellertigra, they do not think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these addictions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their own experience what kind of addiction they should be concerned about and not who they should be worried about.
He said: "If you've met with other dogs many times, and if they're constantly moving their tail to one side, it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you respond based on the same experience."
The researchers say that these findings can provide better information about the feelings of animals to owners, veterinarians, and trainers, the researchers said.
Fellow of the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Sciences, John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior, said that this is not the first study to examine whether or not it is left or right for dogs.
Last year, the University of Linkin’s team found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see the happy dog.
In another study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to the Italian study - when a robot dog's tail was hovered to the left rather than to the right, the dog's tail was tilted to the left."
He said these differences were due to the fact that in different studies, animals or robot dogs were not fully understanding the breath in dog films.
He explained that the study of the way in which dogs react to real dogs can help in this case.
"While there has been enough evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and there are no exceptions in this case," he said.
However, looking at what their behavior can easily be recorded, it seems that it probably won’t take us more time to understand why their doom sometimes swings on one side and sometimes on the other.
Alex Turner's disease caused by the Arctic mankees postponed the Glasgo Gig
The Rock Bank, known as the Arctic Manchurian, has postponed the gig in Glasgow after suffering from the contusion of its lead singer.
The Sheffield Group's programme was set to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new Cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, in the Catholic Church, have pastors of the highest rank, their post is only below the pope, and these people choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his personalities, who will eventually co-elect their successors.
There are currently a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it comes into the group of 120 "cardinal voters."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Fedrico Lombardy said that before the celebration of the promotion of the new cardinals, all existing cardinals will be held, the pope said.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to hold the February pope-parliament in advance, so that it will be easier to plan other meetings involving Cardinals from different countries of the world," he said.
Catholic Voices' Jack Valeriero said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline by February.
He said that in general, the Pope declares the name of the cardinal electorate as much as the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, as the cardinals, and the cardinals over the age of 80, according to his will.
Valero said, next year's pope-sabha will be important, as it will be the first pope-sabha since Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new popes, too, nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
There are 40 percent Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in the Cardinals is very low.
The Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose work is to search for ways to improve the Church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after its formation.
Before that, the pope had to decide all things on his own.
Valero said, "Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois has just chosen these eight cardinals to assist him."
He said it was "possible" that Francis would ask the Cardinals for advice.
But we’re not in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said that the pope generally gives the bishops of large places the post of cardinal, but Francis was "completely surprised - so we don't know whose name they'll declare."

This is a book about which I think it will excite my enthusiasm during the second year of the poisoning of the medical school and it will give me a spark of hope.
Its name is "the courage to win," and it commemorates Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
“When I find myself dripping from my patients’ beds at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics had inspired millions of people and speech could have stopped your breath.”
The election proved unilaterally, and newscasters took a break to show the historical significance of the time.
In the eyes of my comrades, I was filled with joy, and my parents kept every newspaper that they received.
A group of young visionaries was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an approval rating of 82 per cent when he became President of the United States in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of missed opportunities.
This has changed for the first time since the election was held by me.
To put it simply, none of this could have been imagined.
I commend Obama for a lot of achievements, from the return of our army from Iraq to the "don't tell me" end to the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the policy of party opposition has prevented many efforts to move our country forward: including immigrant reform, public options for health care, closure of the border at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the innumerable times I have sided with the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answer to what I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disillusionment.
The opposition policy of the republic is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on masculine children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency’s data collection about the privacy of ordinary U.S. citizens, nor can it respond to the prosecution of people exposing the government’s misdemeanors.
It cannot explain the cause of the murder of U.S. citizen Anwar L. Avalaki without any trial, nor would the public funds and spending limits have been reduced during the presidential campaign.
It cannot respond to the findings of the report, which states that efforts by the White House to silence the media "have been the most aggressive ever since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, this can’t explain the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed into law of the Affordable Care Act.
I don’t know if I expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government, could disrupt the political campaign that would bring it forward.
It is clear that the elected office is not a foreseeable path, because the anti-political parties and random events such as the Newtown Assassination, will give shape to our public discussion.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be mostly self-chosen by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romani presented a confusing and indeterminate option, which did not appear to be as determining their policies or their post.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Still, while Obama’s approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to get back to 2008 through that book.
When I see him, I remember the promises he had lost.
This week, he was reading a section of the book describing the way in which Clinton suffered a lot of damage due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mart camp meeting, he told his subordinate employees that they need to return to the Patri, and that they need to remain truthful about their goals.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We need to remember who we are.'
"Today, five years later, Mr. President, I can no longer agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Moris.
P.M. Tony Ebott's interest in Parental Leave Scheme is disputed, said Clive Pamar
"""The interest of Prime Minister Tony Abbott about the Parental Leave Scheme is a struggle because his daughters can get pregnant, and they can take advantage of it,""" billionaire MP Clive Pamar has said."
Maharathi of the mining sector, who are in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Pamar United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be important in determining about the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Pamar has claimed that only the interests of ministers can be conflicted, and said that Ms. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"He may have a significant interest in the case of maternal leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether or not he got a leave," he said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission has officially declared Mr. Pamar the winner by 53 votes of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax after falling again.
Mr. Pamar called for the resumption of the election counting to move the process forward at a rapid pace.
Tony Aut's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the election come two months after the election is held by us?
"We need to have a better system,"" he said."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill out our descriptions on the computer, vote immediately and we have the result at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Pamar also criticised the use of the pencil to mark the ballots.
Is it because if someone doesn't like it, they can get rid of it?
The use of pencils in today's period seems absurd.
The Electoral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting, and has recently released a joint letter of introduction with New Zealand, the report said.
Mr. Pamar, 59, said his policies include being built an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and they are "very serious" about their new work.
The public office is for the public service.
"""We don't need any other award except for the award of history that we can serve the community at this important time."
This caused the protesters to get into trouble.
Addressing the meeting on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong emphasis on aggravating law and order in the state.
The attacks on lawyers and their families are proving that the perpetrators have become ruthless, he said.
There is no fear of the police and administrative system on them.
Referring to recent incidents of this kind at different places, he said that when advocates are not safe society, the security of the common man can be easily guessed.
RBS has downgraded two forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has dismissed two traders from its foreign exchange department, the information received from two experts from the case. This is another indication that the currency market's suspect Herfer Vine is a smuggler from Jabal Abhishek.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Dush Bank and RBS, have confirmed that the world’s largest financial market, with $5.3 trillion worth of exchanges every day, is in the survey.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, which has been delayed with the investigation-and-treatment of the case that appears to be a recurrence of the Libor Interbank loan herfare.
The Bank, while refusing to comment on Nealmbon, has confirmed that the Bank has received a request for information from the regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the Bank had said, "Our investigation into this case is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS had sent the former trader and sent the records of emails and instant messages received from them to the UK Anti-Money Laundering, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in the year 2010, and is believed to have been fired from its current position as European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on vacation last week, while former senior Corency trader at Barclays and UBS was ousted by the standard charter this week.
None of these have been charged with any misconduct on the trader.
Scientists from the case said that Mr. Usher's instant messaging group includes barclays and bankers of sitigru.
UBS said, after being told by Swiss viniamak, Finma that he is investigating a suspicious sheriff of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss backs, this week he has taken action against some of his employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finland, the Competition Authority of Switzerland, the Department of Justice in the FCA, the U.S., and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – have adopted their currency-conducive exchange rates in the market.
Those familiar with the case said that HSBC, Citygroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suis have also undergone internal investigations, or have received a request for information from the whistleblowers.
Banks are investigating the accuracy of instant messages and emails equal to several years in search of a snag of an incorrect activity.
Investigation-Patch news has given rise to turmoil in traders in the area, who have been among the top earners in the investment banks’ trading unit for the past several years. The most profitable in terms of earnings are among the top earners, but they are facing the challenge this year.
Some bankers have tried to push the case by saying that it is impossible to resort to a very large and highly liquid foreign exchange exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary to do so.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large volume of foreign currency buying-sales, there is a rupture of the liquidity between different trading platforms. The liquidity ratio is exaggerated by the liquidity ratio and the "increased profitability of its own platform" by the banks.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that a trader from its London-based exchange-traded fund desk would be served this week, which deposited about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its insurers.
Credit Suiss said, "We believe that the trader had acted alone, and he has been taken over."
This time, students who are studying other courses, including technical and management, will be able to exercise their voting rights.
The Vice President of the University has written a letter to the Governor for permission to conduct the elections.
With the start of the admission process to the university, the demand for student union elections had started to rise.
In order to reach his voice to the university administration and college administration, he had also conducted a signatory campaign on the selection of his representative.
Students taking entrance to nearly two dozen courses, including BTEC, MBA, Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, Biosciences, Tourism Management and Paramedical Sciences, will be able to choose their representatives this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will have the opportunity to exercise the right to vote for the first time.
Vice President Ashok Kumar said that the Governor has sought permission to hold elections at the university.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as the permission is obtained.
"""It is the responsibility of college management to conduct elections in other colleges,"" he said."
Many colleges do not want to have student union elections on their campus.
There are also no elections due to lack of unity among the students.
The Council had conducted a signatory campaign for the election.

After Diwali, the district administration will be asked for permission to hold elections in colleges.
There are also problems with the lack of clear views of the colleges regarding the Student Union elections.
Gold and silver have been bought by many people in Dhanteras from ports in the capital.
The number of such purchases has increased by 20 to 30 per cent compared to last year.
Longs were smuggling in jewelry stores in Shimla.
There was also a lot of crowd in the shops of the berths ranging from the lower market to the mallords.
While there was a rise in prices on such items this year, people still didn't seem keen to shop on a happy face.
Good luck to purchase on Friday mornings from 7:52 to 10:12 and from 1:56 to 3:37 and from 6:17 to 8:12.
At the time of the said three muhurts, more crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla came up for more shopping.
There was no room for people to keep their feet in the Shimla Lower Market.
In every small shop, the crowd felt the same way.
In such a case, the purchase on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Triodshi Dhantroyodshi of the Karthik month, is a sign of Shhubh Diwali.
The Supreme Court has backed Obama's health care bill.
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Services Act constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
With 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of the Extraordinary Order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens would be required to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty before 2014. Anth santhan-khat decided that it would entitle the government to tax.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other libertarian members of the court, while other judges, Scalia, Thomas, Elliott, and Kennedy, disagreed.
The Court has also endorsed the remaining articles of this 2700-page law, stating that the condition of the Health Services Act that the State Medicaid eligibility increase or that they will all be fed federal Medicaid Finance, is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states, as well as the National Federation of Independent Businesses, to prevent this law.
During the initial session of 2012, the law was opposed by all the major Republican presidential candidates, including the projected nominee Mitt Romney, who was also elected to the Senate.
It is true that our work cannot be done without money.
Wealth is one of the greatest needs for life, but it is not in our best interest to consider it all.
We celebrate the Karthik month of Krishna Triyodashi.
Dhanteras is worshipped by the god of wealth Kuber and the god of death Yamraj.
Wealth is an important place in our lives and religion.
No money is good or bad.
We have a strong sense of well-being about money.
There can be no other valuable thing than that which has come to the welfare of mankind, but that which has become the cause of the greed of wealth has no meaning.
Let us make money for the holy purpose and spend it only for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to make money for the maintenance of the family.
Some part of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but our tendency to make sense, to destroy personality, to make sense of senseless storage or to make money from one-on-one.
The feeling of giving should always be in mind.
A portion of the money you give can be the basis of someone’s life.
A lot of people in society are living in terrible deprivation for them, we should all think for them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and mosquitoes have been given equal importance in the men's spheres of life.
All people wish for wealth and success, and according to their manhood, they also get wealth and success.
The same is true of the wealth that is associated with respect.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he cannot use it properly, nor can he do the work of any other.
If you have money, don't give it to anyone else.
The true rich man is the one who creates the way of pouring into the countless hands of wealth.
There can be no more use of money than the creation of employment for others.
In other words, money is not just a currency.
It was also like your health, your character, your love for others.
Try to be the owner of that money.

Ajaz Jan, MLA from the Punch Legislative Assembly, inaugurated the water cooler at Gurudwara campus.
A large number of people live in Gurudwara, the MLA said, but the water cooler has been installed due to the lack of proper drinking water system here.

Pure plain water will be available in the winter season.
This will eliminate the problem of drinking water for those who are going to come.
Other members of the Gurudwara Committee were also present on the occasion.
After the general election, the new government would not find kerosene in these stores in half a dozen states if it continued its policy to discontinue the sale of kerosene through rations.
The states in which kerosene sales should be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, some states in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the northeast are also prepared to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources from the Ministry of Petroleum, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS stores in the states on two bases.
The first Aadhaar is building up a fast-paced electricity connection in rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
In other words, the sale of PDS kerosene is being discontinued where most rural families have been given a kitchen gas connection.
The Ministry of Petroleum has already prepared a pulse in this regard.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been closed since October, 2013.
According to the sources, the kerosene quota for Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been significantly reduced under this policy.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh litres to one lakh litres.
Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 per cent in the allocation of Uttarakhand by 70 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of kerosene seizures from these states.
The Ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene is being used for migrating.
The price difference between PDS kerosene and diesel is Rs 37.
Those who do so are encouraged to do so.
In the states where PDS will be discontinued, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The burden of the kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore in the year 2013-14.
The accused, referring to the trading firm, opened the accounts of the investors in the name of the purchase-fork of the stock.
Possibly, this is the first time such a revelation has taken place in the state.
While the police have not yet reached him, seven people, including the accused, who were working in the state, have been taken into custody by the police.
This group operated a forged commodity market called MetaTrader-5, which was the name of the company.
The company's employers were making a fake ID on a fake software by taking cash from investors.
When it came to trading, the stocks bought by the investors were seen by the accused.
It was up to him to find out which shares were bought at what price.
In fact, no stock was being bought and there was no transaction for it, as no demat account of the investors was being opened and the shares were being falsely displayed on this fake software.
The police have estimated that hundreds of people have come to the scene of the riots.
In the name of making profits from each investor, up to Rs two to five lakh were invested.
Its chief accused Amit Soni has been taken into custody by Cyber Cell from Jodhpur while his six other companions have been arrested by Indore.
According to A.D.G. Cyber Cell Ashok Doubre, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
It is only after this that the company is able to trade shares to investors through it.
The investor’s demat account is then opened, so that shares can be bought-for him, but this company named Metatrader-5 was neither affiliated with any exchange nor engaged in stock trading.
On September 24, 2012, the company bought a server in the name of Wintrad, calling it trading.
Since then, people have been being harassed in the name of investment through this company.
Currently, eight Indore traders have come forward complaining in a cyber cell.
Even after the sale of its purchased shares in profits, their amount did not transfer to the account.
On this, he began to demand the amount of profits from the employees of the company.
Investors are even saying that the price of the shares they bought was always lower on the fake ID given to them.
This price was decided by the accused at their level.
The company has appointed its CEO and agent in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Maharashtra.
The agents advised the people to join the company by giving them more profits.
Subsequently, two lakhs were deposited from one to five lakh rupees.

In such a situation, all employees are forced to work in fear of accidents.
The next day there was an atmosphere of terror in the staff working from the roofs of this building from falling cement.
This building, built in 1913 by the British, was the first office of the Municipal Corporation.
The building was handed over to the Electricity Board in 1995.
In the name of its repeer, the department is bubbling with color disease.
The condition of the building has been so bad that the employees are also afraid to sit in it.

In the past month, cement has fallen from the ceilings of four rooms.
As a result, a female employee has also been injured.
J.J. and Revenue Accountant Child-Baby were rescued in the accident.
Currently, there are about four and a half employees in the building.

In such a situation, the situation of the building can be easily guessed.

Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Dinath Mangeshkar Hospital, attacked the Congress on Friday while addressing a polling station.
On the occasion, Modi said, "There was once an alliance government in many states of the country and in the Centre, there was once a Congress government, there was once a government of Communists, there was once a BJP government.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call on the political pandits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What the team did.
If it comes with a comparative result, the country will not be asked whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government has been formed, there has been an effort to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai's government witnessed low inflation.
The poor man was given two meals a day.
But when the Congress or its supportive government became, the poor man did not have enough to eat.
Not a single leader of the Congress, not a single leader of the UPA, is responding to what they have done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country can't reach them.
The Congress has been disillusioned.
They don't even respond to the media.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
"""The next day Modi is being asked questions. When the people bless the BJP in 2014, they will present their work to the people every year,"" Modi said in an attack on Congress leader Kapil Sibal."
In a democracy, there should be a servant, not a ruler in Delhi.

Congress, we have already taken the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people are the only ones who have faith.

Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is a hard-fought battle with Apple’s and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google had put an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google's bid has increased several times, and finally offered $4.4 billion in bids.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola mobility for $12.5 billion, a major reason for which was to have a long list of patents with Motorola.
The prosecution said that "Google has violated, and is constantly infringing, despite its efforts to acquire patents-in-suits in Nelamy."
Rockstar has called for increased damages against Google, as the allegation is that the infringement of patents by Google is infringing.
He believed in the first president to be independently elected in Egypt.
Mohammad Morsi has taken an oath of office, but his Victory Day in Egypt barely ended the political struggle.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi vowed a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office as the country's first independently elected president to replace Hosni Mubarak who was removed 16 months earlier.
On its formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi is the first independently elected Islamic President of the Arab world, and the fifth President of Egypt after the abolition of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took an oath on the bank of the Nile River in front of 18 black-blooded judges of the court, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony, which was shown live on national television, Morsi said, "We are aspiring for a better future, for a new Egypt and for the other republics."
The hardliner group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its founding as an illegal organization, and which has been at the forefront of previous governments, has been the focus of the Lok Sabha Party's constituency, Naja, 60-year-old engineer, Mirsi Ki said in a statement.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers secured the building and arrived in Morsi shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car cage.
Only a few hundred supporters have been gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President since Mubarak's ouster. The traffic was also stopped for a short period of time by the Jok Chon Sear Kear, so that his engine's confinement was generally suppressed.
The personal prestige of Morsi, who is portrayed as the non-christian of Braderhud as the "below tyre", has increased greatly after his victory and on Friday, his speeches were not only about Islamists, but also about all of them.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took the oath of office in front of the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "Today Egypt is a citizen, a national, a constitutional and an ethical one."
After that, he went to Morsi Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural lecture.
The military band was officially welcomed by playing the national tune, while they were standing in the currency of caution.
Military Governor Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
On their arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with the slogan that "the army and the people are one hand".
Established in 1908 as a fortress of secular education, Cairo University later became a fortress of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the Teheran Square, which is the birthplace of the revolution that ended last year's Mubarak's reign, and from his post by the military council of the leader removed from the Shahti Swat Kipili.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court instead of traditionally taking the competent oath of Parliament, they bow down to the will of the army, which is an indication that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at the Tahrier Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases, U.S. spying has crossed the line.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been harassed under the Intelligence Surveillance Program.
This acceptance of Kerry came to light during the address of the annual summit of the Open Governance Partnership, held in London via the video link.
Kerry said, I assure you that in this process, the masses are not being harassed.
But in some cases, unsuitable methods have been adopted in an attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the U.S. Parliament has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA) (NSA).
Its purpose is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in the people that has been hurt by the revelation of large-scale phone taping.
The move has been welcomed by six U.S. companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also shut down the data centres of these companies.
The Senate Prabhup<0xC4><0x81> Committee passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform (FISA) Bill, which slammed the NSA on Friday by 4 votes to 11.
The bill cited a number of restrictions, including banning single-phone tapes under the U.S. Patriot Act.
Unauthorized data collection under the FISA would be considered a criminal offence and a 10-year prison sentence has been provided for for it.
The bill will become a law after both the House of Representatives and the Senate are passed by the two Houses of Congress.
"The NSA's phone recording program is under the law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the security of the country,"" said committee chairman and senator Diane Fastin."
But, in spite of this, there needs to be more transparency.
This is not the case, the safety of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill with the unveiling of the NSA's Internet surveillance program.
In a letter to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome the proposal of MPs who are smearing on large-scale phone recordings of the NSA.
It is recalled that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden have been removed from the NSA's documents.
The NSA has been particularly agitated in the international community after the opening of the monitoring of the talks held by the presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France, on the telephone.

In a recent media report, the NSA said it flew information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who has been involved in the investigation.
According to the report, the NSA was the name-musculator of the program, which she ran in conjunction with her British Counterpart-GCHQ.
Both agencies have stolen data from Yahoo and Google's huge fiber-optic cable network, which has been hacked and hacked.
The Washington Post has said in the light of a top-secret document dated January 9, 2013, that more than 18 crore documents were collected in just three days after the start of the program.
These also include e-mail, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run out of the U.S. and a Benami telecomunication provider helped NSA to make access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was much easier for the NSA to run the program outside the U.S., as there must be court orders for such campaigns in the U.S.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied these allegations during a press conference in Washington, D.C., saying, "Even if I have information, it has never happened."
The NSA has always collected all information by staying within the scope of the law.
The NSA had recently become a target of espionage by the German Chancellor.

Schools urged to pay more attention to Mathematics, Spelling and Grammar
Students in English literature courses will have to read at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British history after 1914. (wikipedia.org)
In order to encourage more reading, the exam will also include "Non Seen Text."
A joint English Literature and Language Course will be completed in the course.
From the year 2015 students will have to take a foreign G.C.S.E. in the language, and will be very inspiring to choose English literature as a foreign qualification.
The Department of Education will launch a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow - these will be the first two topics that will have revolutionary change.
It will also make changes in the other major themes next year.
In a separate step, the exam will expose the changes that will take place in the structure of the G.C.S.E. with the official, new grading system, and low course.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gov had said that "there was a lot of consensus about this, that in order to restore people's trust, we need to improve our own exam system," he said, adding that the GCSE was "more challenging, more powerful."
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours in a year or - less than 3 hours in a week during sessions compared to most countries.
According to the comparison, the Australian school provides an average of 143 hours a year, while the average in Singapore is 138 hours.
While, there is no formal requirement to give more time to mathematics, the coalition sources said that the GCSI-League table combines mathematics with more weight to provide additional education in the schools as a result of the overweight.
This course will focus more on "Real World Problems" including Financial Mathematics.
The Supreme Court has rejected the banning of media reporting.

There is a guideline for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have a number of other treatments that can be used.
Assaram's lawyer said that there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but in particular there are two channels that make them more troublesome.
These people are damming their image and are reporting one-sidedly.
The rights of Assam should be protected in this case.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Assaram's lawyer that he had other legal treatments that he could use.
In the questioning of the opposition on the railway gate, Pawan Bansal put a spot in the opposition saying that he had not seen a woman in 15 years.
After that, everyone was surprised where the woman came from in the middle of the conversation.
Perhaps the hint of Bansal was on the side of a major BJP leader and a council's domestic relations.
After turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had committed a conspiracy to complain about a woman who had failed to make a complaint in the last parliamentary election.
Speaking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI had interrogated him in the railway station.
If they were made a witness in the case, would they have been made after the full investigation?
Bansal said that he had written a letter to only one person in need in which the booths were talking about the scam.
If this is their fault, they will continue to commit such a sin.
While it was not a constitutional right to raise the issue in the Nigam House, he asked the opposition to speak for himself.

The way in which Chandigarh is developing or going to be, these people can't even think about it.
The congratulations were exchanged between the two at the Cabinet meeting.
When the meeting was over, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for the counterattack on Narendra Modi in the Chintan camp.
He also said about his speech that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
We need to face up to new challenges.
It was also on the face of the Chief Minister that he took the speech of Singh in a positive way.
Singh had asked the Chief Minister to pay tribute to the workers in the Chintan camp and to protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, they had also said that to keep their word they were also ready for dismissal from the cabinet.
By the way, there are new ideas in the case of putting workers on government posts after the opinion emerged in the Thinking Camp.
In the camp, State JD(U) President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the appointment of workers in 20 sub-committees will be announced soon.
His sign was also that the list was almost ready.
It is now reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will make the list from his own level.
They will also check whether the MLAs have taken their opinion in making the list.
If necessary, a large-scale change will be made to the list to accommodate the old and committed workers.
The general allegation of MLAs is that those people did not have an opinion in making the list of nominations.
The names of people who came from other parties much later have been on the list, while many important activists who have been active since the days of the Samata party have been ignored.
Some people are born with a silver spoon, while some work hard to idealize life and people are inspired by it.
In such personalities, a name also comes from Sava Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani was born on December 28, 1932, the third son of postmaster Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani in a small village school in Chorwad, Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was the third among the five brothers and sisters.
The family's five children include Ramanikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to the economic crisis, Dhirubhai had to leave school after high school.
Dhirubhai had started helping the house financially as a child.
At the time, they were planting bhazi shops near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Speaking of Dhirubhai's first job, he had arrived in Yemen from a ship called Kabota at the age of 17 in 1949.
Here, his older brother Ramanikalal had made all arrangements for him, so he did not have any trouble getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai’s mind.
So in 1954 they returned to Wattana.
In 1955, Ajaman arrived in Mumbai with 500 rupees in his pocket.
And that’s where his business trip started.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani stepped forward in such a way that he never looked back.
His name was not only famous in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani have taken over his son Sultanat.
Like the father, today the names of these two brothers are also prominent in the international level of businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

"Khan said the state government was responsible for this and said its security had been ""removed"" for political reasons."
It is alleged that Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the 2002 PDP ticket from Shopian, was a member of his Cabinet while he was the Chief Minister of Mufti.

According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the past four years to celebrate the birthday of Sardar Patel.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA's tenure (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Vihari Bajpaye was a period during which no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
On Thursday, while laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-metre-high statue of the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, Modi said there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birthdays.
While DAVP records show that UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that the BJP does not speak on the basis of the facts of the PM candidate.
The UPA did not get any advertisements on Patel in the year 2008.
Tiwari said it was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is far less than the amount spent on the festivities and festivities of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family each year.
DAVP has spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birthday and Punyarite, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawahar Lal Nehru.
When asked about this difference from Manish Tiwari, he said, "This should not be seen in terms of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on a number of things, which include things like the advertising rate or the advertising rate for that year, etc.
The truth is that this shows our dedication, which the people who oppose have been trying to cope with the legacy of a great leader without even knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of the people who were killed at the Patna rally last Sunday.

Proceedings from the soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Welle is providing free health services in rural areas of Camaroon, India.
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every week-end.
There are not many physicians in West African countries; there is only one physician for 5,000 people
Vote your vote here or give it by mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of the C.N.N. in 2013.
You can vote for them or someone else in the top 10 to make the CNN the hero of the year.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work. . . .
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to terms with and unconsciously, going to hospitals, which were not adequately equipped to assist him.
Jaime Welle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
Initially, his hand was only broken, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he produced blood clots, which affected his rest of life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameron."
If we had money, we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Welle was swarming with a lot of clinics and hospitals about his father and was receiving whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave the house at 5 a.m. in the hopes that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that is not the case.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people may be in the mouth of death by waiting.
There has not been much change in the situation since the death of Well's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of the Cameroon cannot bear the cost of it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the cost of health care in the country is private.
Well says, "Her only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they can't take the joy of their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his compatriots, Well made a firm determination to resolve some of this.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have undergone 700 free footwear treatments last year.
He himself became a physician, and began to work as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital of Yaoundé.
And they started the non-profit organization Escowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and about 30 people sit in the van, take medical supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need to get medical attention, he said.
Sometimes the odds aren't even with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once by pushing it from rivers and soils.
But when they arrive, they really get the respect of the heroes: Dave, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that can be offered by the community.
The free medical service in these villages is the reason for the celebration of the wedding, and the well - with its great smile and endless energy - includes the joy-happiness.
The next morning, his team begins to meet with hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people on each trip,"" Well said."
They come about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All of these weekends the clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tepidic, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get a gifted goggle, or free birth certificate -- this document is needed in school, but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the team conducts a simple paramedic with local cognition.
Surgery is usually done at the school building, town hall or at home; after the procedure, the patient goes to the place of recovery, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes in the operating room and sanitation equipment, and Well and his volunteers get up and work on Sunday morning-morning.
It's a fast pace, but the village musicians generally help keep the team inspired.
"They've been playing drums all night to keep us up and keep working,"" Well said."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes Cameron's physicians and foreign medical students - has undergone 700 free shoe therapy last year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.
One person said he will be able to go back to work as a result of receiving free hernia footwear treatment.
The man said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a midwife in a hospital, he also works in a private medical clinic around Yaunde at night.
He said this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed with a private donation.
"I don't know when they're sleeping," Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer at Well's group, said.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they continue to run these operations.
Students of medicine and nursing such as O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experiential opportunity for them, which they can never get in their country.
"In gin-worthy medicine, we help to hold tools for Dr. Welle or clear blood clots, in which we are able to gain experimental experience," O'Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S., you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Voluntary students usually spend from their peers to reach the chamber, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after the junta arrives, their stay-at-home, and the cost of the instructions will increase well.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Well, almost a kind of workload, is not difficult.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that make them very happy.
Well says, "I'm very happy when I do this job."
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope they’ll see what I’m doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Take a look at Escowim's website and find out how to help.
You may not be sure, but it is true.

Manmohan Singh is the prime minister and his government, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an environment in which he is in control where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.

He said, "You'll find a better deal."
The administration has said that it should be no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance from their own money may be obliged to change their plans as their coverage, affordability care is not compliant with the desired standards under the Act.

Since the election code came into force on October 4, 313 cases have been registered against various political parties until October 21, 2020.
Only 31 cases have been registered between October 22 and October 27.
With the implementation of the Code of Conduct of Elections, there were also cases of violation of the Code of Conduct.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but the Ahista-Ahista has been declining.
It is being reported that there were more complaints coming against political parties due to the lack of full information about the Code of Conduct in the early days.
There are now fewer complaints on the part of the Electoral Commission due to raising awareness of political parties and taking lessons from the registration case.
Many parties were campaigning as before in the absence of information, but when action was taken against them, they put a stop to it.
The political parties are following this by obtaining information about the Electoral Code of Conduct.
This also reduces the number of cases of violations.

Unexpectedly accepted, John Kerry said U.S. spying "has gone a long way unused."
John Kerry, by accepting it in an unexpected way, has signaled that the U.S.'s protective stance on his surveillance program is softening that sometimes its spying "appropriately goes a long way."
The Minister of State has also admitted that he and Barack Obama are also dual in the case of being a "automated pilot" in favour of the indictment of Edward Snowden on the face of NSA spying activities.
This mysticism has given the U.S. government a political landscape in its relations with its allies.
Speaking through a video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Shri Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, I, and others in the government, had actually found out about some things that happened in the past, in the past, in the past, in the past, in the past, in the past, in the future, in the future.
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government, who have admitted that the U.S. spying has extended its boundary, but have emphasized that no one’s rights have been abused.
"""In some cases, it has gone a long way unnecessarily,"" he said."
And the President is determined to try to make this clear to the people and is now reviewing deeply so that there is no sense of abuse in any person.
I assure you that nothing is going wrong with the innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that, however, the NSA was an effort for a good cause, and its monitoring work has saved the lives of many people.
"We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves,"" he added."
There is a violent incitement in the world that is committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We have saved the plane from actually crashing, building collapse, and killing people because we are able to know in advance about the plans of others.
During this, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that the U.S. legislators will go to Europe with the U.S. Secretary of State in order to assist in resolving the so-called U.S. espionage concerns abroad.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and had been barred from participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to the lack of oversight by the National Security Agency. The smugglers were barred from participating in anti-terrorism organizations.
In an interview with Washington, Murphy, chairman of the first-elected Democratic Party and the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs of Europe, said, "With the U.S. or the U.S., it is really important for the national security interests of the U.S."
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of recording of millions of phone conversations in Europe by the NSA have cut ties with some of the US allies, even though the head of the SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA SAHTA
Other revelations in documents leaked by Snowden reveal that the NSA has made cellphone monitors of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Agenna Merkel.
While defending the incident of spying on allied countries, National Intelligence Director James Clapper called it necessary and said it was common practice to do so by both sides.
In the middle of the season, Murphy said his office is organising a Congress trip that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that both parties and members of both chambers would be included in the House of Representatives.
The names of the other participating law-makers will be released in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme is still being worked on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some "impractical relations" should also be abandoned.
He said European leaders, along with their people, will also have to be honest with their spy programs that have been used for years.
"Although we can amend our surveillance programme to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
During this, this weekend, Mr. Carrie's program is to go to the Middle East and Poland, where he will solve the dissertation about U.S. surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy to change the board in the municipal councils has begun.
Recently, Trinamool was transformed into the board due to a change of party of Congress-led councils in the Saifthiya Municipal Corporation of Virbhum district.
The change took place due to the involvement of most of the Congress councils, including the chairman of the municipality, in Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but also some of the councils of the BJP, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the farward block have stopped the repression of Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai sees it as a good sign for the party.
He said that the 10 councils of the Congress, including Congress leader Viplav Dutta and Chairman Virender Parikh of the Sawtiya Municipal Corporation, were in Trinamool.
Some of the left-wing councils, including Makpa, have also raised the flag of Trinamool.
All have written to the District Commissioner under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and according to the number of force, the Sawithiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Mr. Rai also claims that all the decisions of the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee are agreed upon.
Leaders of other parties including the Congress, the MCP, the BCP, and Farward Block are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
You are welcome to Trinamool by the qualified leaders of any party.
The political turmoil of Trinamool on the Board of Directors is being deemed important due to the change of party of the Congress councils in the Saiftiya Municipal Corporation ahead of the November 22 elections.
This is an example of the seizure of Trinamool on the Congress-ruled Parika Board in Haldiya and Nadiya.
When the party is occupied by Trinamool due to change on the municipal board in the districts, the party members are greeted with a generous welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai is excited to break up with other parties and join the trinamool of the leaders.
“Welcome to Trinamool for those who have broken up from any party,” he said.
He claims that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is growing, resulting in people wanting to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the MCP, says the leaders of the lower levels of other parties are being intimidated.
People are getting involved in the Trinamool Congress terror attack, he said.
The change in the board of elected local bodies has been seen as a blow to Makpa democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its livestock, but it is permissible to raise the question of the legitimacy of a change in power.

Bamfod has appealed against the sentencing order and bail has been granted on 50,000 inmates.
During this, a report in Australia said that she was celebrating holidays at a place where Crabby's holiday is celebrated in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said that Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in the Walkett, but cautioned that as a result of the appeal, the court may extend his sentence to the Barga for up to two years and raise him as an adult.
