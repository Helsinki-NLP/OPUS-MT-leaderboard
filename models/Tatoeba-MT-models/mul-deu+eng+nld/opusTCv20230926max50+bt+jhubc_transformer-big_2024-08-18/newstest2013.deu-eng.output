A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama’s Re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight the election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that election fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. in 10 years.
One thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for carrying out the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have announced new laws since 2009 that complicate the procedure for registration or the receipt of a certificate.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, declare the right to register as an elector on election day invalid, and grant citizens the right to vote for which a court act is available.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state has asked voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that will force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that U.S. citizens, unlike Quebec, do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid in order to obtain the required ID.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This is even more than enough.
Students who are considered to be voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations to vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state had asked for proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states promoted laws that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general election have contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voter turnout.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, although they make up only 13% of the state's electorate.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the electorate, made up only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to exonerate the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics deplore the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them the clear goal of influencing the results in the states that are hitting for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test in fact sometimes displays faulty results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for the conduct of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and give unambiguous recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality in patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
In men of African-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made really understandable the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated, if he does not impair the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases one prefers to be overactive.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not have treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and are offered treatment in the event of progression of the disease.
One determines with increasing accuracy the criteria for a decision who should be treated and who not.
That is why I still recommend carrying out the test.
Most importantly, however, it is to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick with it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
“If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages the health of people.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” says spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, mast-darm, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against bowel cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing gum or colon cancer, respectively.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not currently conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study has found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed a more likely increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family bias.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has sparked some attention last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted from the standard model – our best or “at least wrong” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter – but empirically has not yet been observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely sure about it.
Let’s assume, however, that it’s actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of cheating, and let’s look at what it is about.
There is an inevitably unavoidable law in this world that causes two objects not to be present at the same place at the same time.
It’s not possible to break this rule – and don’t try too hard because you’ll hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also have such a law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantity state" and are in the same "quantum state" while in the same "gap."
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are referred to as fermions and obey politely the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons are moving, an evil gang of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred – certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories’ The Particle Adventure website, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not deal with here and the “force particles” through which the great forces of nature are spreading and with which the Higgs boson is somehow connected.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "particle of light", which is the "bot" of electromagnetic force.
That is, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this location, in the form of a silt that was thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carrier of force".
Stabilized field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the trigger must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond whose surface could only be feared by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like CERN – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – is needed to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (by the way, the photon) do not have a mass.
What can all this research be “good for now,” Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine all deviations between the observations and predictions of SM in detail.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who most hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and close some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major flaws, since it offers no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these studies on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially seen rather than a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also be derived from all the instruments that surround the research.
Willard Boyle, for example, developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it wasn’t the original purpose, this sensor now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras worldwide and has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its committee on “Death in Dignity,” Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the lifeline.
The debate needs to be resumed soon, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much work to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had allowed him a period of two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I made seven years,” he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"It's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resigns to let himself be helped with food.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is to cure my diarrhea because it’s humiliating,” he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pinching in his standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’ home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
“It depends on the person’s ability to take a step back,” he notes.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, large events take place amidst these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overcrowded by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t have any desires in life anymore,” she says, before accepting that she is wearing a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, she still expects a last visit from her son, who is coming from Italy.
The Victor-Gadbois home offers a group of volunteers to take care of the body and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little considering that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The deceased is given oral care with Brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help relatives and patients alike,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family reunion in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while touching to his honor, a young man of 36 years, who has everything from his parents, his wife, to his two young children, he is surrounded by verses.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care to alleviate the suffering of patients who have reached the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor Gadbois Home and the Montreal-wide Society for Home Palliative Care specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care ensures that several doctors specializing in palliative care face the adoption of a law regulating death and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before being accepted to go to death care.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without taking any measures to relieve her.
I’m afraid that patients just want to die because they don’t get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst prognosis, until the last day.
The chances of survival of Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the caregiver for not meeting this wish after their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
However, it must be made clear that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which leads to the patient either sporadically or permanently falling asleep until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Administration, companies of the main construction industry, money procuring political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is collapsing since drastic measures have been taken," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him following an in-depth investigation of the violations related to the contracts for road works in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he emphasizes, “the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars from the contracts,” as some were smuggling their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already overthrown two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit and its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts are also making great efforts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau troupe", which since 2009 has caused Montreal's "channeling cartel" to proceed more restrained in the artificial suspension of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having received lubricants repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Office of Road Construction, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accorso and Lino Zambito, were indicted.
The latter has drawn attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to a Mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand at stake everywhere by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising an illegal fundraiser for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for sewerage, the costs of which were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption functioned smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail in front of the Commission: in ten years he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of $736,000 in exchange for conduit agreements.
Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they were lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first deputies to strike the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, from 2010, she leaned against the sale of a communal plot that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which will eventually be carried out, she says that she "is pulling on a thread that allows her to understand the functioning of the system undermined by ants in order to stop the evil and vilify the culprits".
She says the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of clearing the wound, however, we need an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all, he thinks about the role of the "mandate holders who are about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% share of black money in funding the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a weak decluttering of reality."
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as election campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't go deeper; by going things up with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on your side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements motivate me every day to improve my level of play.
And with a game, it’s even easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress gradually.
They are therefore taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s new additions are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me having to offer the forehead and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti pays respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we are lauded in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we qualified for the eighth final.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have to speak out against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group ahead of Porto, so that we can draw back the eighth-final as a home game.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is given the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to take off this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be a 79-point champion.
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
“Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux win the title, I think we have the guts to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it’s normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something to accuse us of, that’s certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team is building up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and who has also made huge expenditures!
In terms of the invested sums, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game break!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performance.
For the better, we are talking about a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That’s why he came and he proves he’s the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he’s played, he’s made it clear that he’s a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This motivates others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
What a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from taking some time out of the game.
I’ve seen things out of which I’ve grown stronger.
Today I am able to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blue".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our lessons, and today we need to put on the spot an exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, stands close to the players and encourages victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the Blues to Brazil.
Is the forced draw in Spain on October 16 (1:1) a starter game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a match like this in my career.
Bitcoin makes it possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin’s price peaked at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to $2, five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "competitive with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “Credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy by playing (and sometimes even redeem).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously account holders, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded are present in the public accounts’ account spread across the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice for cheating very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionths, which leaves a certain amount of room for play.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in the computational performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also highlights this deficiency.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blogging platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the bill and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-closed sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who insures that it has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are covered in favour of more horizontally aligned systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, in its report, the ECB intends to re-evaluate the various risks that are considered high today in the event of the success of this currency.
We have moved out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
We have punished the Afghan farmers in particular by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and wounded.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined them by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was properly carried out.
The truck and tank convoys overflyed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more inflows of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Its takeover was then seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by taking over government land to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive U.S. subcontracting.
They have brought themselves to the call, and most of them were not involved in the struggles themselves.
As I’ve heard in the campaigns, people want a government that doesn’t consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to benefit from American spending: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is being watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command they will be deemed to be legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization on the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution, the United States wanted it to be a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present, and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that had been at the root of 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
It has been rumored that Afghanistan has vast treasures of land.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s main employers.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, to resume normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' and youth high schools, institute for French at universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was hired in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-government organization "in order to remove and dismantle them from their homes.
This work, which required many local workers, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase of agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free the farmers from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, it would be necessary to carry on less, more well-controlled and directly related civil aid in their favour.
A Constitution with the Breaking Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt has decided to put everything on a map in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily gives it unlimited power, more than ever, it remains divided.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months to complete his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on an interim text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only contributed to an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "walk with the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to refrain from their plans to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protests are raging across the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to an hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should probably end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a bizarre atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt that they were not able to put their views into practice.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to achieve the decision-making ability, 11 persons, deputy members, were added in all haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously adopted.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... in the time of prayer came to be expressed, as some members of the board felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this only as a propaganda attack, are responding to "sacrificial sanctity".
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which recognizes Al-Azhar University as an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia laws.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
You can see here the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, no concrete religious commitment can be recognized.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that "there may be ambiguity in relation to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One here refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil courts are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to the National Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The record of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, the article no longer refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of sol
The Promised Land combines in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and unspoilt nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Bend in front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the silence of the storm of the sea and the fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to His disciples after the Resurrection.
Most of the shrines are located in Jerusalem.
Here believers take the path of suffering or the way of the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Tomb Church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
In Christian view, the navel of the world is here, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place of the Jews - the Complaint Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes there, which then go into fulfillment.
Take a journey to the heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are preserved ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is on display.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most comprehensive department is the Children’s Monument, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for your health
The three most important recreational areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 <0xC2><0xB0>C and the air warms up to 23 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimming smoothly on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing mud as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to soothe the nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Age
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and here Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in that place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, named after the zodiac sign.
Fortune is supposed to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman statesmen, including Pontius Pilate.
Evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre today.
List of attractions for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
You’d rather take the money on the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which can be exchanged easily in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations that connect the sub-city to the super-city.
Precisely speaking, it is an underground cable car.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which includes transfers for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only cozy food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without shellfish and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falcon) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-groomed cats that are cozy and unobtrusively scattered through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
Cats like lively places and don’t say no to treats.
A rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, which is an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparison period, before the lifting of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Mighty" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While lawmakers and lawmakers discuss the benefits of the Law on Compulsory Language Tests for Migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families left in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every working migrant must pass a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in retail.
However, the tests are expected to become mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
It is not only necessary to take language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the purpose of obtaining and prolonging the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their education certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, Problems and Protection of Rights
The totality of examinations will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the press several times before the law came into force: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to have to present language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Most importantly, according to the spokespersons of the immigration authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
“Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers,” says the head of the representation of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, your rights must already be protected from your departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a profession, education, language skills and medical examinations face problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions who put him under the pretext of helping in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours on the day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland you will be promised one, and on arrival you will be deceived, get their passports taken away, and not receive the promised salary," Tolib Shwaripow, the head of the Tajik Immigration Administration, said in a statement.
Don't moan, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they not only do not master the language of the country of destination, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
“It’s hard without language skills,” they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists underscore the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, then there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "No access for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Don't shy away from costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be faked.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to save himself the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be purchased easily, both civil servants and civil servants agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who pass the test for the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered positions in areas where no active comprehension with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Weapons Market
Extremely low share of legal weapons in criminal offences
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten the Arms Act for private gun owners.
The authorities are responding to the latest events: wounded in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the amok by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and set the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Weapons Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, the author of which - representatives of various arms associations - calls on the authorities to refrain from "useless exacerbations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal justice, Vasily Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from operating on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find any weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons come to the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, which are stolen from law enforcement agencies by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons that were stolen from both the police’s arms chambers and directly from employees of the law enforcement agencies.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons depots.
In many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
“There is evidence that in some cases it was a fire foundation to cover up the lack of weapons,” the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private armament factories that are not able to withstand international competition and therefore are wasting arms on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
In particular, many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a production of its own, sometimes handicrafts, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” the former military official explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated how much each of the five channels accounted for in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the topic of weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there because of the "debt of those responsible who have come to terms with weapons in their work," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict zones, 14% come from thefts in weapon production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun shop who doesn’t want to be named assures that weapons found at illegal excavations have long since been outdated.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to provide supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, such as a TT gun, is purchased via a fencing line.
The weapon is displayed and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically conduct check purchases at dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other over acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to the station "Begovaja" where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun was there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and date with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth".
At the moment, I even come up with a few beats about a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the punching rings just because he knows I won't piss him off.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album where "everything is possible" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the sack, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I not only buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disk.
"I can then shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we're negotiating with each other," the expert describes the move.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No paperwork is required or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," it says in the ad on the "Buy Combat Guns or Guns" website.
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license," user asks "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service on the net.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to scoop coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Responsible persons accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," said Dmitry Kislow, a spokesperson for the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service on the net.
“People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to scoop coal,” he says.
One macaroon for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal firearms, according to experts, prices ranging from $100 to $900 can be expected.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons depots by mid-range observers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons in all of Russia in the period from January to October 2011 decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives dropped by 8%.
Fast-food and supermarket workers strike in the U.S.
One in four U.S. teenagers is sitting behind McDonald’s box office at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages at Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will swell further or whether they will soon be airborne again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food employees, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of founding trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, at which sales were held in the U.S., which attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to handouts.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, raided branches of the chain, targeting low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paying Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the protests on Black Friday called for wage increases and expressed concern that the contribution to the company’s health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if the company increased its average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they’re currently donating for wages.
If Walmart were to shift the wage increases completely to its customers, it would cost them only 46 cents more per purchase in the future.
For them, that would amount to just $12.39 per year compared to today’s overspending.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that there were only protests in nine states, and these did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesperson, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the Huffington Post website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees put down the work and the protest was merely "another PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where, however, their target was not Walmart affiliates (which are not wanted in this advanced city and therefore do not exist so far), but McDonald’s and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you're not given sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, its simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she earns no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get out of New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. teenagers after school at McDonald’s were behind bars, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income in it or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they’re going to have to cope with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current rate.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate leadership from standing in the way of this goal and deterring or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you're not getting paid for sick days!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food workers together so that they can get a fair pay and deserve the economic prosperity!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be moderately over-listened so far."
The theme of augmented reality, which is popular with followers of modern technologies, has recently been commonly perceived by the lens of a special spectacle.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the Interactive 3D Technologies Group at the Microsoft Lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It attracts the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with just hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is conducting.
- We deal with the interaction of human and machine, but want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, most of humanity has been stuck in the phase in which it is working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are an advance, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else do we have in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more understandable.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his surroundings are recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much more easily with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these vicious virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone about his actions and intentions.
In fact, any type of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and scarce, rather than exhaustive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, however, the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example, gesture and language.
- What do you mean?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this squirrel box?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- Normally I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the time and what doesn’t?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approximation.
I think that in the coming time, we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately capture people's reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary to take into account not only the resolution along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough for gestures in particular.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our lab in Redmond with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly this device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might be able to solve the problem...
Or intensify the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with different camera tendencies to see how that helps us in three-dimensional positioning.
“When I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the palm of your hand while on the road, but I think the best option would be an "alternative" augmented reality in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and they have their strength (private only you can see), but at the same time also their weakness, because an augmented reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What is your group’s response to this objection?
In my lectures, I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection material.
It takes pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "pictures in the air" something hand-tight, for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still as weak over the hand at the moment.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to override the brain?
Let it think that it feels what it should feel when it is just seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task with which we will have to struggle for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills as well as platforms (other than in fitt).
So far, the brain can only be moderately over-listed, and we still have many years of work ahead.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "St. Petersburg Avantgarde", which is dedicated to urban residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, already landed on the list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearded man who is sometimes seen at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the Summer Garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at Vernissagen.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in the face and provides them with a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a slingshot and became a Petersburg slingshot player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist presence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the grey standard evokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Palace of Culture Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I knew I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters at the time came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevchina"; from this arose "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only once finished.
It attracts me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
And all of that came together in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was until the renovation works a musical and artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and included the popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, their “Leningrad” became their “Leningrad”.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a press poll about the award "Persons of our city".
I won in the "Artists of the Year" category, and with that I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be like that.
In a clown, this blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the big picture, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and oriented himself on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But perhaps one should not give a man his hand, but should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by disguise.
We recently saw you play the role of the city's film director, and a cultural city should have a hero like that.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful too?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the destruction of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- Stas Mikhailov's performances are a few thousand!
- There are abandoned women coming to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come, not 10,000, so there is less management, less money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not destroy the achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which even hung on a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, it is something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
They are said to be servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real czars, because the czars may not understand much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are needed.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
In St. Petersburg we have some who might be the experts, but they are blocked the way because it requires higher-ranking experts who properly evaluate the first and free them the way.
Now it only matters to your own taste.
The same goes for the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding food ground.
Art can only grow on our stones.
We need a cultural food base, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in the Universe
Earth is in danger.
Earth warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth inhabitants on board are on a quest for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises, how can we propagate ourselves in gravity or on a substitute planet?
I don’t think there are many options.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"It's Mars and Venus," says the scientist at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of breeding in the wild was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the terrestrial species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guardian eggs were sent into space to investigate the effects of gravity on the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a hold; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychew, the laboratory head of the RAN Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
Without solid ground, the chicks overlapped wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely muted.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, she simply died.
“Twice we let the chicks slip and put the whole thing in place because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, referring to the failed experiment with the chicks in the room.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
“That was just the case with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats got young.
The problem of propagation directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are ripped from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our mosquitoes flew away from it, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Is it beyond space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
“Finally, no one answered this question,” says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in the room, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, who after long flights, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more dangerous it is, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolab in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; however, infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness to the rise of life on land to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb of the mother for about 9 months in water, and the fact that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim just 2 weeks pass.
“It’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So while for a newborn, weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not get out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form back enormously quickly and thus also decreases the ability to squeeze the child out.
All right, let's get around this with the birth-initiating aid.
The birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth’s pull, the body cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in orbit like an adult for training in a load suit.
He will simply miss what is of elementary importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person,” says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space has been a mere theory.
Someday, however, it will become a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a distant planet that will become the home of their offspring born into the universe.
NK<0xC3><0x9A>-Chef: Control of the Black System Failed by Blame on Politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in relation to public contracts, but does not apply them.
In a conversation for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala, said this.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly – and I don’t think that’s the case with us,” Kala said.
A similar result appears to be a joint check by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he leads the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and the control authority, whose duty is now once the control of compliance with the law, hinders its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies’ Control Committee, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in the framework of which the laws of the two countries regarding public procurement were compared with one another.
What was it concrete about?
This is a parallel examination, which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a matter of the European legislature setting out how public contracts are to be handled, on which the national legislation is based, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a bit "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to put in place new and more precise rules over and over again, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project for you?
Precisely such joint control could help us to stop constantly striving for the perfection of the laws and the reduction and austerity of thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only load the system with excessive "paper cram", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to use the system than if the thresholds stayed higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to ours and also has a college that is only slightly different, but basically both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that these accounting offices also exist in the individual federal states - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by our districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would only like to compare this without specific information; nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better at all.
Is it because the testers are better there?
Not sure, but as I said, I don’t like comparisons like that.
It is also worth noting that those countries that are a role model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of revising the Procurement Act, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novelle is only in force for a short time, it does not yet have an effect on our examinations.
Since our checks will take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of ineconomy" and examined and analyzed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes are most likely to have an impact on the outcome.
Do you see the passage of this law more positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be observed.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to examination are accountable to the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) for any non-compliance with the Procurement Act is equivalent to a violation of the budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
In my opinion, not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let’s say which path is not the target.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not fix entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and the control authority, whose duty is now once the control of compliance with the law, hinders in its activity.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the thing,” but he can’t say that we do as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded alone due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it has to be applied correctly – and that is what I think we lack.
On the streets there is a single glacier, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice.
Mostly, however, the roads are well manoeuvrable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were well accessible this morning, with snow and ice glaciers prevailing individually.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 <0xC2><0xB0>C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower elevations there is only a thin snow cover.
On the combs of the Erzgebirge, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district street guard, Nebel's vision was limited.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently accessible without restrictions.
However, attention is given, for example, to bridges on which the lanes are sometimes required and smooth.
All second and third-class roads, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, sectional snowfalls or snowfalls remain.
Higher attention is therefore given, especially in the higher layers.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger due to glaciers, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an outlying layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Highway Directorate informs on their websites.
The road masteries warn drivers of ice slicks, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
It can be used especially on second and third-class roads in Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to districts.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An outlying layer of snow lies in high altitudes on the roads of the districts Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or hot, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
Temperatures range between -3 and <0x2B>1 <0xC2><0xB0>C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well accessible today, but local attention is given, and the way of driving is adapted to the weather.
This is freezing in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can become ice-cream on the roads.
Local is also to be expected with fog, however, the view will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the District Roadmasters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but high attention is recommended by the road masters between the 80th and 131th kilometers.
The first-class highways are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, there can be glaciers.
The highways of the second and third class of roads are humid, and therefore the reference to possible required sections also applies here.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, drivers who are travelling in the direction of the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to rely on snowmatsch.
After the use of scattering vehicles, Snowmatsch remains on the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nightly snow-driving forced the road masters to use, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk about 3 cm of snow fell according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the highways are usually unrestricted.
"In the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, the highest snowfall remains in the altitudes.
On the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo, drivers in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k must expect snow-match," said an employee of the road administration <0xC5><0xA0>umperk today to the agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Her colleagues in Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also had to go out at night, according to their information, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are unrestricted, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district, the drivers have to drive cautiously in wooded areas, as the highways are still damp.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, Liberec
In northern Bohemia, the roadmasters report several poorly manoeuvrable sections of road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K. is blocked according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero, so that snow and ice stay on the roads, but no problems have been reported from the deep plains, especially south-east of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are generally dry there.
No traffic jams have been reported so far.
Ice glaciers are reported in particular from the area around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless skies and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the road I/13 at the border of the districts <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was necessary due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the highway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the downfall of the world will take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans are so excited about.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re making fun of it and saying that we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world’s downfall.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the downfall of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers in more detail?
This is a nationwide charity event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which is forecast for December 21st at 11:10 am.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously from 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who is this idea coming from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the downfall of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once passed this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the world’s downfall, with which people can also support us by purchasing via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also recorded the so-called Hymn against the Fall of the World with the title "The Fall of the World falls out".
Even today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the end of the day, provided that everything works out and the world does not end...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live together in a live broadcast from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you come to cooperate with the two?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charitable events and concerts...
We strive to engage these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us, and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the profits of the concerts against the downfall of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, where we have been working together with the Tap Association at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various recreational activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be created, into which we will then enter with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you choose to use?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to bring a lot of instrument trunks and other luggage...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked out without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered partly already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were witnesses in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for people with disabilities. There it is still unusual when someone in a wheelchair is travelling alone in the city center.
It is not even natural there to allow a wheelchair driver, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to recover from the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we hang out with...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not very common for a larger group of people with disabilities to actively participate in social events, and we are a bit ahead of that with the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a thing, but only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willing personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: What motivated you to form a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a caregiver at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I myself am a musician and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, tends to say, something has gotten out of control (laughs).
The band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also begun to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and cannot see it outwards, one’s own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can approach things differently.
In the show business, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is looked at with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer has most is compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progression for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If one wants to do something good, one must not compromise on many things and must also seek some discipline.
In my opinion, however, this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have twice the week rehearsal, have to complete preparation phases, and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm in many quickly runs out.
But this is how it works everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.

Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemia ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland being the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space probably started much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, and they did not always come to terms with it.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld of December 6, 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
<0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the REP Hirsch Prize in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics" by Robert Esnault-Peltterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and space.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's internationally recognized contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the Earth-facing side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway-draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket engine was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the design and the details of this project remain unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisine.
The information for this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled artillery.
The research was conducted by the Institute Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents transmitted, it is clear that the research had progressed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Armed Forces.
In 1937, the draft of a photoelectric hunting rocket from Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda povietrzna i rakietobomba lonnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA made an effort to join the International Federation for Space, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member as early as the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1,800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w Desert began flight tests with the two-stage missile RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observation of altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
From these missiles were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missile had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a capacity of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a capacity of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland’s accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Non-Profit Work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the Law on Non-Profit Works.
This decision sparked a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages) there are price tensions.
This is to be understood as a condition in which the manufacturer attempts to maintain economic competition by importing favourable goods by "subjecting" competition in order to gain a larger market share and increase its profits.
To a large extent, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy it cheaply, or to give up their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, the state expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is further reinforced by the absolute unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay their taxes and thereby to compensate for the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own populations without regard for the social consequences of private capital.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage field.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and, on the other, by the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as growing differences between poverty and wealth.
In Germany, there have been public food outlets for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work for several years.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state must raise their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern countries will undoubtedly be in the same condition where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century when this was the case), or for a starvation wage at the edge of society.
Naturally, the question arises here, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital stays the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the point that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planning economics leads to economic disaster.
Private capital holds tightly on its position that the state must not intervene in an orderly manner in the economy.
Then one must wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense or even directs it.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which virtually everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, in the absence of finance, a State Ministry is tasked with drafting bills by private law firms closely interconnected with industry.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer proceeds from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been understood to be in disintegration, and the offices were occupied with violence.
For lubricant money, through illegal lubrication of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew indelibly, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes" ... "People of character did not apply for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline he did not have a consul for eight months" ... "Man really began to talk about the one who was in the medical profession.
As can be seen, today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to general societal interests.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not able to recognize and enforce the benefit to society as a whole.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not at all striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the present state of affairs, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites face the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the Law on Non-Profit Works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state’s share of capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are" .
“If my sons didn’t want war, there wouldn’t be one,” says the dying Gutene Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
One is behind Israel, arguing with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other is supporting the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated on the Palestinian Arabs and describing the state of Israel.
At this point I do not want to write about who is the culprit and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; ultimately, the inhabitants of Israel today, including the self-government areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not the beginning of violence itself.
I want to open the eyes of readers behind the scenes, the eyes on who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them, and my own understanding of who or what group of people is significantly influencing the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it has not arisen within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a special one that could be called the head of the crab (I don’t know if there is anyone else above them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course I do.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to prevent their name from linking with high-criminal acts, in the background of which always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both stood.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries under the Rugs, after the fall of the Russ only remained in Iraq).
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed – he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859-1871, the Rothschilds’ global quest for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was intended to break the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war was intended to cause the world's population to a greater degree of concern, and not to reduce it to a greater extent, to a greater extent, to a greater extent, to a greater extent, to a greater extent, to a greater extent, and not to a greater extent, to a greater extent, to a greater extent, to their universalism.
The method by which the group of the richest families works at the forefront with the Rothschilds is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat).
After the assassination of the Habsburg Successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo enabled them to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire), then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to be able to defuse the Second World War even more easily, the bankers allowed politics to create a latent conflict situation by simply laying down Germany with gigantic war reparations; in this way they created the prerequisites of poor masses, so that they would continue to be able to defuse the Germans with a faunch and a solution to the violen of the leaders, to applaud the Germans.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was breaking away from the chain in which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps certainly created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in detaching this war, the Jewish people will, as in World War II, fall victim to the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you just think about how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
One must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only choose their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to defuse a war with Iran, who could come to terms with Iran's membership of Iran, which could go global over Iran's membership of Iran, and we're talking about Pakistan's membership of the organization for cooperation (China, India).
In the light of the 1994 words of David Rockefeller, “The only thing we need is an all-enthusiastic crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn at birth is implanted a chip to subject this being to total control.
And it causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one may buy or sell, that is, the name of the beast, or the number of their name.
Here is wisdom. Whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrative Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government – it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution was aimed at the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free the hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six embassies managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity – they traveled tarnished with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who allegedly ran the country for a sci-fi film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by "Exfiltration" expert, Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful house piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film vary - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the filming of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically and slightly overspread therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after Krimi No Child's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the director's hometown Boston.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that deflected this director’s previous films from the Hollywood Standard.
Affleck, however, also demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entry sequence of the first storm of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and the unpredictability when history occurs.
Affleck and his team also have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the false film bar at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn’t actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality a little - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport is turned away by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and thus they are far from being alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some traction, which is a film that you can follow with a certain interest and enjoy the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s.
However, enthusiasm is difficult to awaken.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day, and as proof of how overlapping the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually launches a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has this year decided to host the competition "Absurdest Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop".
“This idea was brought to us by the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a women’s share of 40% in the management of large European companies,” Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this survey, told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
Among the nominees are, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for the insurance companies.
"Another incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding incorporation of bioethanol into fuels, which in turn is detrimental to nature, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance in egg yolks, or because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance in the human body.
Criticism in the past also reaped the factual ban on the use of the term "butterfly" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that trade and industry lobby, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the claims of Czech banks even with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests also included that the highest-class bananas in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
In doing so, the European Commission defended itself with the argument that it would only harmonize the non-uniform national standards that would hamper trade.
The EU has already softened the standards for fruit and vegetables against the resistance of some countries, noting that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons on sale must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU relied on an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of drowning in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using vintage straws.
Curious incidents also occur at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official position in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a member country in addition to the so-called absurdities.
The EU thus established the maximum volume of food supplies that could be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom preserves, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas probably came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x83>mec (US-DEU), offered funding for applications for grants to the municipalities, which should specifically be funds for the placing of grant applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States are easily the target of criticism, but some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole are more likely to be recognised.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions in this country also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products, and this struggle does not always win.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the designation "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the interior (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to change their name to "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar cane.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or Parmaschinkens now also show up Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or also the Saazer hops.
With an EU mark, the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can be used.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura says.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic being pillaged for 20 years, how thieves are running around freely, while people are raising taxes and pensions.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don’t like, then I’m trying to propose a solution to change that.
And since I’m over 40, and independent and impartial, I have no other way of influencing things than running for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then you made your way to the castle right away.
Do you not turn your back on your constituents?
I’ve been telling myself all along that I’m going to start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate election.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for the office of President if I am elected to the Senate.
My goal, however, is not the function, but the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, are smiling in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we are making a difference to anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media wants to rob one of his honor and confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed about me that I would bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle has taken place with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million kroner.
To do this, you have to change the laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have committed myself to ensuring that the tour guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-scale politics - if someone from the right or from the left comes up with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party freelancer, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without the thought of drawers and party dogmas of any party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me rather to the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important to me that we continue.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that with what you just said?
If you create a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
I may refer to this as populism, but all the proposals I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you only have slogans.
In the long run, you are not going far in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce, for example, material and criminal liability?
I don't have a choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our site in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legalise the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and public prosecutors.
And then, perhaps, the respondents would have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality that points to deficiencies can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things by myself; and if it doesn’t work, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I can’t do anything on my own; that’s why I’ve talked to several celebrities about whether they don’t want to run for the Senate.
I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, for example, but he refused because of overwork.
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of eligible voters have not gone to the polls at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign yet; my transparent account is only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, what do yours look like?
I estimate my private assets at around CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb, which is about a million, and then I have a few million on it.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I have always liked James Bond as he drove in the car, was gallant towards women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I, for example, be in debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live on the senator’s salary alone, so I couldn’t finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn’t run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to take back those activities?
This has nothing to do with the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially retarded my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would completely stop my business.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday edition of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the mind - on the example of Spijkenisse and the newly built Bucherberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a nearby large company, says: "Well, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library for today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a barely visited sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant municipality has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to replicate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully brushed concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become a statistician: a library had to come!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam’s architectural firm MVRDV, master of cool bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual calmness and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books in mind under the arm of Grin.
And while the jury was still looking around and crawling with its axes, the mad Maas piled up his eloquent pyramid of size and ended his actionist-supported speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Bucherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro expensive mountain is shattered.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and semi-detached houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Bucherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project has been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
As a result, the faceless small-town cake, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unfashionably ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to be a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: bookseldorado under cheese bell.
There is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the real pleasure of space and reading is revealed when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football players boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally the book shelves stand along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on the head and pushed the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The inside of the Bucherberg is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house engineering centers.
A special pleasure are the black book shelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes armour, sometimes ladder racks.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even fleshed-up architects and civil engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse municipality, at the request of the standard.
And so we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Friesland farm one day.
For many years, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as a root substrate.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the bulky waste.
For the library, the vlies - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre hike, the literary café not only offers fantastic views of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is an ecology project in spite of the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bucherberg is under a glass storm, the sun itself appears only briefly inside on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue binders, which are transverse to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, serve as a shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even called the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "longest overbearing soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
With this, for the first time, the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-blue library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline that is called in the Fachjargon Identity Foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literature history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a point of view for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany has taken the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin came along.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of its special relationship with Israel, Germany has to be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is transforming its foreign policy, away from a policy managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The problem is that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they still touch on their role, but they are on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a “normal” foreign policy really mean from a German perspective?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to confront the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by taking part in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany will even have a certain amount of respect with it.
Because it signals that it is being taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that under Obama, the government secretly has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not at all as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That’s exactly what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player – does Germany even want to take on a leading role?
Or is Germany still having a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the Euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, various anti-German feelings are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to a variety of neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Mark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, also Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
There is a name that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the actual nameholders do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm, which specializes in copyright infringements in Fernost.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters so that they can register their trademarks.
So Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company there had the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and intellectual property is known.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he proposes that Chinese companies officially receive the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means that women who fish for themselves are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is diluted, the loneliness disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial failures and process costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of 15 billion euros a year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because after the long term of the contested name became "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarism money because he violated his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
To this day, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that resembled BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to impersonators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there was a shortage of staff and space in 2010.
Last year, however, the "emergency situation in the workflow has returned to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition procedures had decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81,500 objections are still pending in the office.
Taking action against it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new notifications around the world for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simplify this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitation motor vehicle parts was abolished.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One has missed this because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO also rejected the Munich objection.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be damn careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had to review even one hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg in vain offered the opposite side a “high six-digit euro amount” for settlement.
“You can see how much that is worth to us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to sink back to Europe.
That is, if there are imitators securing unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long left the Group, yet it was able to reverse the registration.
“You have to be careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should “report everything that is somehow worth protecting, even in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his trademark drama, then one would probably have to pay license fees for one’s own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the choir tastes Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell up - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - crushing, disturbing and chasing each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost takes it out of his fabric shoes when he combines it with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers have come, aged between 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-Help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected people, according to the United Nations’ United Nations Programme to Combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245000 AIDS survivors in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the Association Voices for Africa has found patents in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or laureate on Zulu.
The Bantu language can speak fluently no one in this room but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and bringing them back to where they originally originated: in the south of Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Some 2,000 people live there, some in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are susceptible to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the small country that all of Swaziland is sick of is showing itself: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Cuts of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, dying in the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal per day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has since taken care of AIDS orphans almost professionally in Esitcheni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzlauses and crabs are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia, trichomonads, candidiasis, trippers and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - yet, around 20 percent of HIV new infections are related to this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than among other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Human papillomaviruses are also common in adolescents in this country.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are obligatory to report.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the signs and symptoms of a STD?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urination, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis of most STIs can be cured and late successions can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gags that the choir is taking over all over Germany, a lot comes together.
“In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, the president of the club.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and enforceable woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, for example by one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the backbones of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms on time for school lessons every day.
Anyone who has no one else comes to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid the same by the club as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized, together with the American health organization PSI, that many in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because so obviously the disease is all over the country, you would prefer to keep it dead.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but those are hardly used.
Culture is another – flesh to flesh.”
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together through the South of Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of courage, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, many of which are still known at the southern tip of the black continent from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already wiped out some grim border guards a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their stepchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light" people say there.
And if you return the 8733-kilometer airline to Heidelberg, to the staggering singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice blanket may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shaded region of the planet.
It should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been struck on Mercury.
But no one is linking the finding of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send pictures to the Earth: small gaps in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto orbiting the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition.
This cut-out of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are more difficult to identify as blue dots, the pink "newborns" in the constellation.
This star-forming region – called unromantic W5 by scientists – has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This shiny glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that swirled out the star in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light-years away Trifid Nebula in the constellation Schütze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (triple, three-parted), as dark stripes of dust triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of Snake Bearers, astronomers have photographed the foregrounds of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two fusing galaxies are tearing apart and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not lie, he may call them by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a cut from the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, 1,400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
Stardust is always producing new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, connected to the Rosetten Nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a small black hole, no dust exists yet, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated shortly after the Urknall, when hydrogen was found predominantly in the universe.
Our insights into the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever larger – and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows a look into the space just above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its specialty: the high light-gathering power.
Despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it is sufficient to reach the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to the whole thing after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes all the honour to its name.
With its total of four mirrors, the distance tube can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is set to cover 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures are to be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is still looking into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired in an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from the spacecraft are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The image shows the latest launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched in early 2018 aboard an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the primordial beacon.
Scientists believe that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to orbit Mercury – scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day – and getting 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysh Mountains is called wild romantic.
The small bus crawls over the curved road, past densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one might think, one is in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and is very durable.
The final station is Lerik.
The small town boasts too much Soviet-era architecture that doesn’t want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only traceable.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to attract tourists.
"Baku was famous with the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita of about eight dozen Talys from the area is documented, which is older than 100 Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is sheep shepherd Shirali Muslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given the oldest documented person, who turned 122 years old, Muslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The man has been married three times and has had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to another daughter.
So has Shirali Muslimov been counting down a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the seniors in Central Asia.
"Apparently many high-ranking people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "extremely many very old men also live in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially as there was a lack of personal status register.
A cup of melted butter every day
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik are often strikingly reaching a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why are so many high-income people living here in the south?
The Assyrian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh people.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh people who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is not exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that tirelessly rolls her up and down.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are also two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests prepare tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly in line and limb, under her headband she hides long, dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I have not bought food at a supermarket.
Then she tells her story of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the ruder.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman’s mouth.
But the cult, driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham the Ruder took over.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s elders.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s longtime son is right: “The old people enjoy high respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.

He has, as Mohammed Mursi almost apologisingly said, temporarily cut off the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, are the Egyptians about it, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were punctuated by the Islamist-dominated 100-headed Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour paraforcerite, are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, it says in the draft, the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does “principles” mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the muddy formulation and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: in all matters concerning Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be drawn to be the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
That doesn’t have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the dismantling of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation.
Also problematic: the civilian military judiciary should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s rule to suppress oppositionists.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morality and values".
This is legally so vaguely formulated that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids the Prophet Muhammad and his Messengers to be insulted or insulted.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubios encourages the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, like so much in the draft, which Mursi presents for signature and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The Revolution Has Returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual rallies on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the Charter down before it could come into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential candidate.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs "on the mountain of history".
On Twitter, he told supporters of Mursis that he wanted to lead a “coup against democracy.”
“If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” Jasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet tainted,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, blew for counter-demonstration, but cautiously not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many smuggled women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Mursi, "Clean the land!" and they insisted, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have aggravated civil war-like conditions.
Mursi’s followers obviously didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the polling station in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights doesn't even come up"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to go by February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRR) defended the Muslim brothers while they were in prison under Mubarak or standing in court.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto puts them out of force," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, including by the international community, which looks at the ideological directional struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warned, "You are raising a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most stinking fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for rather nasty fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
So about you have to imagine the nasty smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-stained trout, which - depending on how fragrant you would like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a feast here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very refreshing specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire department, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "rakfish general".
People around us are consuming small fish cubes and consuming large amounts of alcohol.
“Many people like the aquavit more than the raccoon fish,” says Havard.
Spirits can suppress the smell.
I'll cost you a few bucks.
If you avoid bringing the rakfish near your nose, it’s not bad – like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options yet and fish were soaked in airtight saltwater vessels in the fall.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol dampened senses - consumed.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it into the world press, and most people do not seem to be bothering.
Here one still hates to name Anders Breivik - that racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we only refer to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for Norway’s current wealth has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a careful people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very adorable, we don't like prahleria.
Norway has been very cautious about its oil wealth – a large part of the industry’s revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone was throwing around with money they didn’t even have, Norway kept its wallets closed.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And of course eat raccoon fish," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand up for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
An Elch burger like that is definitely something else. The juicy meat I like.
But in the evening, the stinky fish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging smell - fish.
There is a live TV switch to a fly-covered showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe thirst of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
At present, the traffic in Mexico City is very poor.
Even on better days, this is a city that is always clogged up, but on Monday a steel ring was built that shuts down several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will retain the presidency and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the separatist government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember it.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represents a major improvement over the fragile, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, which is the PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party places high expectations on Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden among highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are crucial urban in nature.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years on a spot in Brachland near a large landfill.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for their violence and the murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he has at least not adequately addressed the issue of the murder of women during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downhill neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body starve had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this one, the family said, has been denied so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a spokeswoman, a restless founder, a norwegian.
They want you to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and failures,” she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidency on Saturday, he will take on a big responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has vowed to take special care of this problem during his tenure.
“I hope as president he is as he was as governor,” says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutor’s Office Claims Bradley Manning Has Not Complained About Abuse
Prosecutors oppose Bradley Manning’s accusations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
The liberated U.S. Army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
The U.S. Attorney’s Office on Friday sought to establish that military-free Bradley Manning — accused of revealing the largest confidential information in U.S. history — had failed on several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military custody.
At a cross-examination Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month prison term in Quantico, Virginia did not show any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh detention period - Manning had said he would have considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his tenure in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been detained from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions of detention.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein interviewed him on Friday for the forms, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, did not contain complaints about abuse, although officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "No problems" and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he was not complaining about his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011 that was supposed to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during this meeting had been to downgrade his observational status for "prevention of injury".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is a level under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the surveillance status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and was once unconscious due to the heat.
Not knowing what had happened to him or in the outside world would have been burdensome.
“My world shrunk to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell – at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours – and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even just go to bed.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated from the outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and the guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an allegation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept naked in his cell in Quantico one night and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had stated that during this count, he never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket.
During Friday's interrogation, Manning stated that he had closed a guard's order that he should have dropped the ceiling he could have covered himself with, but he admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning had stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night and had previously tried to show an official that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the tie of his underpants or his flip flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention rate should he be convicted at his trial before the military court, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
Continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all detainees held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the harassment of the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all the charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call to their memory difficult times, he says
Navarre believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when confusion spread within me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigns").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of where to go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called “Mexican” all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
Later, I decided to go for “Mexican-American.”
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for abbreviations or punctuation.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won’t let go of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue for extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is a reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc following the example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war in Mexico against the drug cartel, even though he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and resentful.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leadership to give them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be missed.
So as soon as a U.S. government official has even the slightest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites about how Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - did not get a chance in Mexico and headed north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not in Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, attend good schools and get good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity is sometimes possibly blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the case in the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have gone.
And then we wouldn't be trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they belong neither to one nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should have learned during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational community want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to employ Mexican Americans as provisional “ambassadors” for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
Let us tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country is and how pressure is exerted on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Oh, now.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in the face of unfair income distribution, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are making a mess of how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual confessions, countless buildings were laid in mud and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time rockets from Gaza were hit near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these whims.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly pat situation could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week has strengthened the hard-pressed on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, are said to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its group itself suffered major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are swept into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power that was once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over Hamas’s party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Exciting Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist imprint could stand before the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where the king of Hamas is overthrown.
And especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – the by far the most populous and most important Arab country – on Israel’s southern flank has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the fraternity with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more reliant on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could turn out to be an actor that cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
From a military standpoint, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully for a while.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States remains intact in its position, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockades that have been pushed into the West Bank and thus into the majority of any Palestinian state, but they continue to protect the Palestinians.
Netanyahu's Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group ahead of the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these vicious Palestinians have to hide and leave a state of their own?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles just like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could give them a streak through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense policy is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in restoring their economy.
The fact that President Mursi is teaming up with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking slow steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder constitution that will undoubtedly one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only exacerbate.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside.
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resigns for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give more influence to outsiders to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by an exchange of territories and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to Israel’s move to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he missed out on the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is equally inclined to participate.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on unified cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images, which are sick parts of the body and who are ill with cigarette smoke and who are ill with child smoke.
Aside from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packaging in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small fonts, is from next Saturday.
As a result, Australia is introducing the world’s most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government expects studies that have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at 26 years old are 99% likely not to start smoking after that.
“You can already see in young children that they understand the message of trying to promote tobacco companies with their brand image,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
Thus, the laws would favor the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be offering far larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover unbearable packaging has risen enormously since the British American Tobacco Group, Britain's Tobacco Group, and the British Imperial Tobacco Company, Philip Morris, and Japan Tobacco Group, have been doing their best.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media is precisely the population to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, barring them from acting as sports sponsors, and forcing most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Anyone who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to promote their products doesn’t come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in brand experience reports written by “very normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even makes a video for it – or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing instead of marketing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are engaged in larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings.
In the meantime, they have expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don’t affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a sip and put the box away,” Victor El Hage says when buying a cigarette box with a photo of a mouth tumor printed on it.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to refill its shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort out a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have just completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he said.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored even sometimes.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty nerve-wracking – even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored from time to time.
This will force the brain to get lost in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us these days almost constantly stare at one screen or another, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting to perform a satisfying activity but not being able to do it.
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time passes only slowly".
Tiredness can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in English for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Langeweile under the Aspect of Attention", which in September appeared in a magazine entitled "Perspectives on Psychological Science" at a lecture on the subject "Perspectives on Psychological Science".
Some groups heard a loud TV show from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content; others heard it at a low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who took the hard-to-hear television reported feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to attention disruption to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you practice a one-tone activity - "such as searching for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that herbal apples and critters, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even combat these by staying physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a throbbing speaker, a particularly tiresome film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida — especially when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of those who grew up in school and doing homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know if the percentages of boredom have gone up or down.
However, he is confident that "youth will be felt particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a big impact on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall prey to gambling or drugs to alleviate them — studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity, which is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can provide a sense of happiness in the short term, but in the long term they are fleeing again.
So, if you give your bored child an iPad, you can get rid of the boredom, but he has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers itself from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to entertain, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel comfortable even beyond the constant exposure to activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the painful, relentless desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to deal with once the noise is muted.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is facing a court in southeastern Colorado that will soon be legal in that state: possession of a few marijuana brocades and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some of his friends were traveling by car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was invited for possession of drugs and drugs—cavalier offenses, each with a $100 fine—and received a court order.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for own use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities surrounding marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities will no longer prosecute adults over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced they are continuing to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so rapidly that I don’t even know what’s going to happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for orientation,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent we can follow,” he added.
Washington’s law, called I-502, comes into effect on December 6, and thus also forms the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time – such as how the state’s requirement of “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Ballung area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offences in persons over the age of 21, and that the police “will no longer seek penalties for these offences immediately.”
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana, and drug dealers would continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people have to be held accountable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has an obligation to prosecute violations that were at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer show adults for possession of smaller amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time with enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a deep-seated dispute among local officials regarding the big green experiment to date.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver-based lawyer who represents the defendant in the marijuana crime trial and acts on-site as a spokesperson for the National Marijuana Reform Organization.
“They’ve spent such a large part of their lives chasing people through criminal law that they still can’t accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national pattern cases for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervous about instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to step in to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be smuggled into legal marijuana under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal governments approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although these could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided on a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community has voted against this amendment to the law.
We judge ourselves according to what the church has decided and not according to what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only college students today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once considered to be the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my admission to Worscester College in the late 1980s – I had intended to study history there – I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with comrades having sex in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson explained shellacically that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason – a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My now-deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equal protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable" due to their political views.
They ask for a seat on the Equal Opportunities Committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was aggravated by a recently broadcast documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford’s Conservative Students’ Association, driving in a Rolls-Royce and protecting in a silver suit and silver-plated walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as “sins for introducing higher tuition fees.”
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservative Students’ Association, told a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing trend of links at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without having met us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student at Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unacceptable." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the Conservative Student Union at Oxford, said she had a loan from JCR students.
"This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to award Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree due to cuts in university education.
The atmosphere would have intimidated even the Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even took part in it with joy.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been aware of what was to come next.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake cake, and quite cozy.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students chuckled.
There were tears in my eyes.
“I suggest that they take a few French lessons in your free time — so if you’re not too busy with your social activities,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone slightly tipped my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Union.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be pressured.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters claim to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to change myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics, and economics who had ironically attended the conservative Eton College told me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared their opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the break-in of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that were before me stretched out before my spiritual eye into a fiery fire of reverence and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist perspective of history.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found shelter with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said quietly.
Such a thing they would never do, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always put on the spotlight impeccable manners.
His damp eyes were darkened.
Give the whole person a chance.
I'm sure you're just being fucked.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory follower, had given up on the pressure and resigned his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another storyteller had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly shy of shame, I admitted that my parents had been brainwashed, and called them "old bastards."
The relief lasted only for a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hogs gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'm glad you can call me a wine-sleeping cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford – a university that not only brought forth 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but still hides behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Meister der Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture have been composed, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which is still to be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most highly read aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility doesn’t have to be a disadvantage.
“At the very least, they don’t show up on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, his decoration, his food and his music, he recognized and felt his influence.
“All the guests felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” that began their career at Haute Couture Week 1995 in Paris.
“He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long treadmill, which proposes a role change: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the treadmill, to admire the lofty "audience" of the "Orainte" at the time, the "Orainte" with the "Orainte" and the "Orainte" for the "Ari's, the works of Valentino.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I draw him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time when she wore a valentine.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my nephew, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a decollete that honors his name.
“It was a dream come true,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberg.
“Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion maker called his close ones) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture of the late 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, accumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace of him".
And that's what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh a total of up to 70 kilograms, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the skeletal paths made of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle pace, while they have to keep the balance and carefully set their steps and not to erupt.
You know that every step can cost your life, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Arrived up, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tirelessly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scales that a mining society has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 exploits the occurrences in the volcano and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of plywood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
“Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route,” explains Anto, who normally runs three routes per day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely completed, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) combined.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a purely inhuman effort, however, is three times what it would earn with fieldwork.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the bearer, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I converted to Islam after having married a girl from Bali, where they are, yes, I am a Hindu.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently, and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left the first traces in him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently, and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work here another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent young man, but suffering from life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and stands up every morning at two o’clock because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluishly in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders at the bottom of the crater.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur extraction to save costs, and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guardians of this natural park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are required from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human body.
"This work is for the animals and not for the humans," protests Madrusin, a stubborn, 42-year-old supporter who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners cling to the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases of schilt ... of course, except for the usual respiratory problems and the coughing up the throats, arthrosis, bladder.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks via a goat trail between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but the poverty persists generation after generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as human cargo at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Needs Babies to Save the Economy
The Singaporeans are pushing the blame for having no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint bonbons, but nevertheless – or precisely for that reason – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper song, the local saying such as "Shipping a "bao" (laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the advertising spot will reach in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to breeding, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don’t we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
The one who does not take this issue lightly is the Government of Singapore.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But so far everything has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 – also known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have much more options in terms of life goals and prioritize, apart from getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the rise in marriage and childbirth, the result of which is a reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the decline in the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cached xenophobia thrives against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Authority for Urban Development has started to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they deter construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out faster in days and even weeks than the larger residential units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district will not have much effect.
“People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
The children can get others.
“For me, it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as reasons they can’t have children.
That’s why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – the government can still do so much.
Offline Private Offline is online now Private
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "the area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to when he publishes situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Peri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very personal" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" when applying it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me or of someone who's making a fool of themselves," he says.
The boy is aware of the fact that it is wrong to post obscene photos of nudes, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or to friends," he says.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone received him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has hinted at him or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone is bullying me or asking me to, I’m just removing them from my user account,” he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend’s boyfriend has been blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just made it private.”
After that, he explains a number of steps to securely set up a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if he's disliked me or I want to erase something from him.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a Master's degree in Education at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion on what may be disseminated, published, or said, and this at an age where the maturity is not enough for it."
“They should also be elective when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is, is to ask them questions that bring them to thinking.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of you, like the one you posted by a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what to share or publish," he explains.
According to the Guardian, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
Completion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced in advance and was supposed to be signed in theory by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources in the State and Presidential Office initially informed that they would hand it over after the clause, but later declared that it would be passed on to the Web.
When asked about the text, they stated that the contents were presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The little information circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the governments of the Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, the Peruvian presidential office sent the media an e-mail with the “closing statement” of the summit, but it was Humala’s statement and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong press call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been previously announced, was equally little published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists would be available, but they largely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which documents a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which will begin Monday in The Hague, in the process of introducing Lima against Santiago, to hear the pleas of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently bringing to this International Court of Justice,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is, and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a hand-print in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia filed a lawsuit against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Agreement after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, in which it agreed to condemn the judgments of this international court.
At the summit were the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its president, Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state left the closing document, announcing that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set at a total investment of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be promoted to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organized, cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices and to trade in the natural environment in all areas of South America".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphant moves, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus unite our countries and create new economic forms," the Peruvian president said in a statement read.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, which are located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption into the Union of South American Nations,” it is currently excluded from.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to respect the maritime conflict after a trade disputed by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will review all these routes - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes negotiations with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, which is intended to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from the integration of its citizens,” says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "were in World War II and in other conflicts" and "are practically a fatherland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
"Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but instead adhered to his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there were "reasonable assumptions at the time that Assange would be extraditing to a third country and not complying with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to undergo interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish judiciary allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental health would be impaired.
"Since he's been in our embassy, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," he said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a tight space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London was the granting of a letter of freedom to travel to Ecuador, and that this was found in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities to have found a solution to the dispute between the European Union and the United Kingdom.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, runs a series of proceedings on various European courts," he explained.
And "if Britain grants this release letter tomorrow, I think that's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, how Swedish jurisprudence was allowed and in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lies that deter free speech."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists who seek to gain and blackmail,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador for not being more dominated by such journalists "and also not by the bankers or hegemonic and spice-civilized countries", and anticipated that in a re-election he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue on the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not give any opportunism and no one legally disguised as a coup d'état" because of this "Paraguay became the legitimacy in the Legitim."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, to negotiate the maritime borders between the two countries "absolutely."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the maritime border disputes between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries commit to take the judgment, even if it turns out to be very hard."
Referring to the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive term, he stated that he "sees this option with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it sometimes falls very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to that responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I would retire from public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"It's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would expect to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any way mean a relapse in the health of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor was trying to "weaken" without noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic refrained from saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their illness and in whom the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment in time, and the survival of the general population has become vivid, that these are exactly the same as those of the general population," said the head of the HIV.
Andrade Villanueva, an expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, commented that the scientists have concluded since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life in the case of Zhngi are from one hand to another in the case of Zhngi from one hand to another in the case of the degree of impairment of the immune system of the person.
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who is diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25 in this sense “can get 75 years old without problems as long as he is under control,” this expert explained.
In order to properly organize this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is still true that national figures have been published since the publication of the 60th edition of the AID.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and as of May this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of the drugs. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: “Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to affect global mortality, early diagnoses are needed, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all people who need it.”
This proposal is agreed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio, who had a test done at a private laboratory.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, I’d rather spit three times,” one says in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio said, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to have his testimony to animate those who are already in the context of today.
The sooner you know if you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, you should learn how to live responsibly.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shopping table
There are big gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken on the issue of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
“In the places that were set up for this, the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously given out individually, now they give us packets of a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who don’t have access to a condom,” he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need these?" is a widespread mock question from social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system who do not want to expose young people, the correspondent said.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the shopping table, but in outlets in public toilets of facilities frequented by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez answered the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally ranked 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the U.S. Court of Appeals has confirmed a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an unfortunate precedent has been created for every national company with problems with branches in the neighbouring country.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale in the Bancarrotas District Court in northern Texas results in Mexican companies being helplessly succumbed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door and door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. insolvency law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings are the commercial insolvency brought in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings by companies with cross-border profiles is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a simplifier.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies, after recognising the liabilities in the bankruptcy that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro is not the first case where this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under companies of the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also correct that, after the deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Mehrpool and Liverpool have not.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation since 2008 as part of the great economic crisis in the United States, which hit the country.
For this reason, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family objects to the same court of appeal so that the vote is held in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not enforced, the Cerciorare claim, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States, is filed.
The seriousness of this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), in which the procedure carried out by Vitro in the framework of the Law on Commercial Bankruptcy has been described in accordance with the Law on Commercial Bankruptcy 15, and in which it has been pointed out that the contract signed by L.
It is also pointed out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency which guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramboles: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General Balance Sheet
After the advertisements by the Mexican air traffic unions against the former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not move forward for several months, the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Syndicaal de Pilotos Aviadores (Ft.
The lawsuit brought by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceeding against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to deduct 198 million pesos from the bank IXE’s F/589 creditor account under the name Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is encircled
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has reached to unite governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental establishment that destroyed partially protected areas and is the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has not complied with a request by the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it viewed them as a violation of the free expression of opinion on social networks.
Homex Long-Term
In an effort to pay for long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings to the market stock certificates over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies called Competival was founded, whose goal is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world collector of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, be it as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, deputy and head of BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or president of the Basketball Association.
"All my life I have worn many hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora, where he lived with him at his home in Isaam<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as a co-manager or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve been allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as a manager, co-manager or coach.
There have been many fulfilling years, including five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me: “I have a very strong and 2m player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best throwers.
I still remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would have provided another.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was awarded to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he chose to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States for the first time.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we placed fourth, which should have been bronze, if it had not been for this Canadian referee who let us repeat the last draw for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who were not there because of a Knie in 1990.
One team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Houruitiner as a substitute for the locked players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without considering his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armando Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for coaches, table officers and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, treacherous and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon of cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as the nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "djinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also the actor of two comedies that were broadcast only for a short time, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His works included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS television series about the Ewing Clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The commercial "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create the expectation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series achieved a spectator record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s sister-in-law (played by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had bullied her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman portrayed the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a reluctant businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to lead his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what's on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts for those of us who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT TV channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann in the series would be treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought would harm someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press.
After the liver transplant, he volunteered for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations are ahead and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called “Deudarmageddon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester there ever was," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor this semester, which is supposed to be the last in history, to offer courses on the “end of the world.”
In Temple, the possessive Professor Barry Beautiful gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and investigated how to compare themselves to real life.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” said Beautifulr.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a proprietary professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
“We’re not taking on 2012 so we always have the option of stopping the course again in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent downturn", students must study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than “to continue to work until the night where the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said of his high-average student course, which filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places available.
The students, in turn, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing explained that he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I haven’t heard anything from a class where this is taught,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less than one professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old West Chester student at Temple last year.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that dates back several centuries as people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The internet has increased these speculations.
“Somewhere else people don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately think of a new date" or philosophically that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the end of the world comes.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
