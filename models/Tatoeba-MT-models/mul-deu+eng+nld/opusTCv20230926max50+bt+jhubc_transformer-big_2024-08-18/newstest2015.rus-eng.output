FANO of Russia to hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will hold the third Expert Session “Assessment of the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, reported in a press release, which came to the editorial board of "Lenty.Ru".
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the results of the Expert Session for the year and to draw up a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups and the criteria for the evaluation.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a single approach to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations for all three academies.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is in agreement.
Following the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation", - said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert and analytical department of FANO of Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than one hundred scientific institutions of Russia.
Its outcome awaits the adoption of a resolution.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014, at the address: the city of Moscow, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among the stars relatives, that is, those that originated from the same cluster.
The results of their research were published in the journal Nature, and briefly they can be found on the website of the university.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas that preceded the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, by its chemical composition it is possible to determine its place of birth and region of formation of relatives stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of its relatives in the cluster.
The results of the modeling conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, scientists using a supercomputer modeled two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
For several million years, this object is transformed by its own gravity into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added label paints to the initial gas flows and found that thanks to the rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud, a high degree of chemical uniformity is achieved.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for stars related to the chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata Police Arrest 20-Year-Old After Chasing Motorcycle at High Speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through the bushland to escape from the police in Pilbar.
A Carrata transport police patrol tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, discovering that it was speeding up to 125 km/h when it left a service station on the Batgate Road.
Police say the biker did not stop and continued moving along Burgess Road, then rolled into the bushland, as a result of which the police lost sight of him.
A motorcycle and a man corresponding to the driver’s description were spotted near the house on Walcott Wey in Bulgare.
Carrata police have charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Carrata World Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not “blow the door” in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “blow the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was announced today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
With regard to our responses in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners will like this time around, then we will make decisions about how to respond.
This will not be related to knocking on the door, some offenses, misunderstood, - the minister emphasized.
We will, first of all, deviate from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners in terms of their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are seeking, - continued the head of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation.
If they say with a full voice that “these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to go to it to punish Russia,” it is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, it does not.
We, on the contrary, want to learn more actively about WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome, as we believe, the EU’s discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and, at the same time, anti-dumping measures are applied against the branches of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the rules of the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use cheese in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the cheese after flowering loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It blends perfectly with many cultures.
And next to the cheese you can and should plant both plants, decorative at other times, and flowering at the same time with it.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, an improved bush, a broad-based bush, and even a garden bonsai-like tree with a strangely curved stem.
Just choose the shape that best fits the design of your garden.
In Karelia convicted of selling fake money, a resident of Leningrad region
As reported in the Republican Ministry of Interior, the man engaged in his criminal fishing in the Olonetsky and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in inheriting in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetsky District Court.
And in order to end the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, it was staged in Segeju.
In the course of the investigation, the guilt of several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013 has been proven.
At the end of June this year, the files of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the four-year term of imprisonment with a stay in the colony of the general regime.
The sentence did not come into force legally.
Recall, last week, two other sellers of fake money were convicted, which were paid by them in Petrozavodsk stores.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them was deprived of five years' liberty, the other of four.
A fine of 500,000 rubles is imposed on each person.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk marked the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish provided military aid to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally took place at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the promenade named Sedov in Solombal.
At the event, representatives of the veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children from the cadet class gathered.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not returned the sea,” said Boris Karpov, chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Maritime Steamship.
Then the city spirit orchestra performed at the event, and the pupils of cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped shoes, lead, wool and many other supplies and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrickein fighters, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The ship's caravan was not found by the enemy and reached its destination safely - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in the vital caravan operations, 126 transport ships and about 50 warships were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill that would protect trade unions as civil law.
“Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is a co-chair of the Progressive Party Congress.
That's why I'm proud to present the Workers' Rights Enlargement Act along with the symbol of the civil rights movement John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination against the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of the opponents of trade unions.
Amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers who face discrimination for their participation in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is no doubt not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are offering is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have faced in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution drawn up to ensure that Hideki Tojo’s militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly acknowledged that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations with the aim of protecting and improving working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be deemed unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations to protect its interests in the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and its constituents included a guarantor.
For generations, Americans have accepted as a proper basic rule that labour rights are human rights.
When that country consulted other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions – and to participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and governmental institutions – must be enshrined.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to an organization and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how we should.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the expansion of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade unions - has long been ripe.
Keith Allison and John Lewis revive the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge Temporarily Blocks Law That Could Close All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say is likely to shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed into law by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who do abortions would be required to have hospitalized patients within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that at the moment doctors can continue to make legal abortions, continuing to seek such powers.
"The justices will be allowed to work legally, continuing to take action to obtain the powers," Justice John DeGrewells said in a statement.
The hearing will be appointed during the month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Proponents of the right to abortion were pleased to meet this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital credentials.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a fraudulent law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit against the law’s cessation of action from three out of five people.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision relates to the doctors from the two clinics, who were not the plaintiffs in the case, and also applied for admissions.
Louisiana is among the 11 states that have passed such laws, and courts have recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortions object that such measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who makes abortions in Louisiana has the authority to be admitted to the hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who make abortions while their claims to the decision are pending.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trade networks should be Russian-made, says Oleg Nilov, deputy of the State Duma from the faction "Just Russia".
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will be further detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <0x3C>...<0x3E> For other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers,” Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation" the draft law provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which establishes a reduced rate of VAT of 10% for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50%-percent quota in trading networks is part of the stimulus package for Russian producers.
On the shelves will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Nalohovik", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to .
In addition, there will be farmers, farmers, small shops, and so on.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will grow.
In addition, they will be given the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some will learn faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,” he said.
Previously, Russian companies were often unable to break into the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche is released and can be breathed with relief.
But we should not forget that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin American, Turkish and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "moment of silence" when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet come.
Almost a month later, we can talk about an increase in the demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in the prices of finished products," said AiF.ru, the first vice president of the all-Russian social organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", K.E.N. Tamara Kass.
Unequivocally, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to secure the sector behind local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will unfold between companies working under the uniform laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all articles.
And in this situation, the trading networks will have to “reach” the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that low-quality goods will come to the shelves.
Possibly, under the kind of produced in Russia will be supplied foreign products with broken labels," - adds the expert.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that with such a schedule, the foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to import analogues, while stores will be able to boost prices by the second, as a deficient commodity.
The forgotten idea of import substitution in the early 2000s was again discussed by economists in February of this year due to the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is intended to oblige retailers when ordering suppliers to be considered with domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go on the path of import substitution much faster and more confidently, and the system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," - says deputy Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism will be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful pulse can also get meat production.
As you know, the largest share of imports are preserved on beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out, 65-70% still belongs to Russian products," - argues Kasyanova.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products contributes to import substitution and may speed up the process.
However, this initiative itself will not lead to import substitution, as this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is confident.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought abroad, which means that full import substitution will not occur, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is still necessary to set up in the country the production of domestic products in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide", - states the expert.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research reported that the chances of dying during the study were 20 percent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
NEW MEDICINAL PROTECTION: New Drugs May Slow Lung Cancer and Ovarian Cancer
Researchers tracked the women’s medical path over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Women who were older and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible facts.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of outbound services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people who are undergoing treatment far from their home, may
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elishe Niv, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September in the Kuzhensky district will open the doors of a new FAP
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaybeljak was started in April of this year and was carried out according to the typical project.
The cost of the works was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Communications and Information of the Head of Mary El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the funds of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and prophylactic institution is almost 230 square meters.
Here, medical care will be provided to the residents of eight settlements: villages of Toktaibeljak and villages of Dementjevo, Püncherumal, Tunia, Fomichi, Torajbeljak, Shinur and Tashkayal.
The new Fieldshersko-Okusher station will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet the sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will be opened in the near future.
Murdered four-month-old son in a shaky state of novice boxer will appear in court
The resident of Chuvashia will be on the sidelines of the defendants for the murder of their own child.
In Cheboksary, the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksars, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused along with her four-month-old son came to celebrate the birthday of her son-in-law in Cheboksary.
After a long table, the new bookmaker decided to stay with the guests and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the intrepid woman laid him next to her on the bed to feed her breast, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of strangulation.
The criminal case, reports the press service of the SKR on Chuvash, sent to court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Do the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions of Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fit into the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week, the MEP is expected to make “small but principled” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zeroing of population income growth.
In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation will be in effect for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-off shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change,” a source told the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast price growth in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of the food bans will come along with the possible introduction of sales tax (sales tax) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will have to be in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat dumped the first inflationary results after Russia imposed "accurate sanctions".
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
The increase in prices is already seen in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products were becoming more expensive, the government was forced to launch systemic price stability monitoring measures to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key factors of the growth of the index of consumer prices continue to be the colossal rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, the domestic conversion of the sums of these countries against the exports due to the flight of the population to foreign currency, as well as the embargo.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of a minimum set of products would not have jumped 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on the import of foodstuffs provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of the growth of the inflation component.
If we add fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as worsening economic growth prospects, inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Aleksandr Razuvaev, director of the analytical department "Alpari"
In the 1990s inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, at zero it was also above the current level, another thing that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think by the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, Managing Director of Assets of UK "Maguta Foundation"
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still successfully restrained, but if there is further pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase the level of inflationary expectations of the population, which are traditionally manifested.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer solstice and perhaps this fall will become more noticeable.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to stand, since Russia still has financial accumulations.
Gardening centers are saddened by a decrease in the number of homeowners
Such a fall, caused by an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could lead to gardening centers starting to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers co-anmes reach the “primary age of gardening,” according to the research.
According to this report, people who rent a home spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the house for parking and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors that pose a threat to the industry, the annual sales volume of which, according to estimates,5
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest level of spending on household goods for gardeners.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and lack of space for the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening advisor at RHS, said: “Cultivating plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retailing horticultural goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out a mass cleaning in the fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Fund "Agriculture" were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Fund "Agriculture" were replaced as early as Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the removal from the post of Executive Director of Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lausanne Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were silently replaced.
The deputy executive director Tatyana Angelova, who had previously been in charge of state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, BGNES reports with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I did not attend the board of directors of the fund because we are not members of the board of directors by law, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can’t say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday," Angelov told the newspaper.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatova, who has been the head of “Investment Credit” at the central fund in “Agriculture” in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Prior to that, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov will be appointed in his place, who was the head of the regional directorate of the "Agriculture" fund in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Head of the Foundation Atije Aliyeva-Veli retained her post.
She is currently in charge of the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey Calls on U.S. Diplomat on Espionage Report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification in connection with a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. clerk and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine "Der Spiegel" and the internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the importance of this message, saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
Earlier reported information that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target of intelligence, triggered a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's Largest Companies Unite Against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete with Ali’s online market.
However, achieving the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals – eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% - each of the Internet companies, according to the report.
Registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
SP will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (China’s largest social network with about 438 million users), Tencent, and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fashionable hotels, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a movie studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dun Tse, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, says Dong Ze.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online shoppers so that they come to ordinary offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon sales services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the biggest ‘pier’ in online commerce,” said CEO Wanda Wang Jianglin.
“Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation, the odds are roughly equal,” he said.
China’s e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., its volume will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, according to official statistics from Bloomberg: this is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
According to forecasts, by 2015, this number could grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
Until recently, Tencent Ma Huaten was China’s richest man, but according to Bloomberg’s Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Lee now ranks third among China’s richest people, while Wanda’s Wang Jianglin ranks fourth.
“It’s very interesting to watch for this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge the even richer,” said Bloomberg, director of China’s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Cao Li.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba right after the creation: “Rome cannot be built in a day.”
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only new companies, but also the well-deserved leaders of the world of online commerce, is evidenced by a report published yesterday on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its U.S. competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit over the period nearly doubles the similar cumulative competitor’s figure – it grew almost three-fold year-on-year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has a huge potential for generating money, largely thanks to its mobile apps,” said Bloomberg, an analyst with the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to an updated Alibaba prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July amounted to 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were mobile devices.
Alibaba is about to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after selling shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
The company’s road-show, which preceded this event, will begin on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO release is expected to be a record in NYSE history and allow the company to attract around $20 billion.
To date, the record for the amount of funds raised on the US exchanges belonged to the payment system Visa, which in 2008 made the primary placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion on it.
At least half of the food products in the trading networks should be Russian-made, according to the State Duma deputies.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
It is about making changes to article 8 of the FZ "On the basis of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestically produced products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so for them will be made a "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, reports the newspaper Izvestia.
On August 27, in the lower house of parliament was introduced a draft law on amendments to the FZ "On retail markets", which proposes to revive in Russia agricultural markets, where small producers will be able to realize their products.
Magaluf, the police chief, has been charged with corruption.
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion from the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous Magaluf intoxication center.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been put in custody as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street that houses most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf.
According to the daily Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca on the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by guards of the Spanish National Guard in connection with allegations of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities has a serious impact on the state of their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
We can’t endanger our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer who had blowjobs to 24 men during a bar run.
The island’s authorities have since tried to stop the hooliganism among Magaluf’s holidaymakers, minimizing the number of scandalously famous alcohol races around bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where a blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bar Race together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous accidents in a state of alcoholic intoxication associated with a crazy fun known as “balconying” when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony.
The first day of spring marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport
Spring has prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide’s airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short showers with a gust of wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter issued an early portion of spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
The shaky conditions are supposed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in boarding Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m., but fell into the windshift zone – a sudden change in speed or direction of the wind at short distances – and was forced to climb to altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to reach altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two showers.
The calculation of the estimation of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks The Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
At FAS, an expert council on the development of competition in the construction sector was established.
At his meeting, Vadim Solovyev, Head of the Department of Control of LHC, Construction and Natural Resources of FAS, said that "Today's calculation of the calculation of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible".
The normative base makes pricing opaque and can lead to unwarranted construction costs, the FAS believes.
And propose the cost of construction of state-owned buildings at the design stage to be determined on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the current calculation norms and single estimates for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the "road map" and are now under consideration in the Ministry.
“The replacement of traditional accounting documentation in construction on the calculations of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” Vadim Solovyev explained.
After all, now every bolt and nut is counted in the estimate, and it does not always seem possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, dishonest construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
The Minister agrees with the FAA.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost of the structural elements already exist: methods for calculating the prices for constructive solutions have been developed, and calculations are made on these indicators," said the head of the department of urban development and architecture of the Ministry of Interior.
As a pilot, the field of road construction is chosen.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As told by RGB, head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko, the calculated norms are long outdated, but another mechanism for business has not yet been proposed.
“As far as the proposed calculations for the structural elements are concerned, in practice this is difficult to implement, since completely different technologies are often used in building construction,” he says.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to the government order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine "Expert community of professionals of state order" Ekaterina Lesina, today the state is the most payable customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering of the Industrial Center of Capital Construction Rosatom, pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly powers and do not allow it.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is as constrained as possible by someone’s managerial influence.
The expert council proposed to form a system of public procurement in such a way that the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case, it will be necessary to equip the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the client’s staff and budget costs for its content.
At the same time, the specialists of the client will have to have the knowledge that allows to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach could lead to a drain of highly qualified public procurement participants due to a lack of interest in obtaining a public order for incomplete works and a small amount of contract.
Deputy Head of the expert consultancy center of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Yevstashenkov believes that now the procedure of public procurement has turned into a business game to the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "the participant when filling out the application must indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "less", "analog", "or", "type", "can not be", "can", "not be", "lower", "higher", "higher", "less", "less", "less",
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish the requirements for the content of the application submitted by the contracting entities.
Another problem 44-FZ, in the opinion of Yevstashenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the stage of the application.
When considering the participant’s application, it is really possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even begun to carry out, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert board was also asked to shift marginal income from the top to the bottom eschelon so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Council of Experts, State Secretary, Deputy Head of FAS Andrey Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the contractor should be responsible for the order.
And otherwise, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Rykin's "Atele": "Is there a claim to buttons?".
Israeli Children Return to School After the Gaza War <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and rain mines fell on their settlements during the aftermath of the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas.
The start of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashash kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's hills before the arrival of the students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to go back to the dimensioned life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shane Bart, said that suddenly starting school again was "a little weird".
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz, which is located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the cease-fire agreement halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not take to the streets or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas further away from the Gaza Strip to escape missiles and mines.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine fragment, doubt whether they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which has worked hard against Palestinian fire.
He advised children to study diligently and said, “We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
It is expected that a new stage of indirect negotiations will begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, were killed in the war, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to substantiate this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazans fired 4,591 units of missiles and mines on Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found shelter in more than 100 schools that have been turned into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and the fighting continued, the officials in charge of education last week postponed the start of the school year.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion, the price of real estate showed the highest increase in winter in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to an overall increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lowess said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they have risen by 11.7 percent.
The next power markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose from an average of five percent to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was the Canberra, which underwent government spending cuts, where prices rose only 1.4 percent per year.
Mr. Louless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put up for sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low-interest conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House of Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Grand Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the eighteenth century has not changed since the time of construction, except for the old age.
The outsiders come here as an excursion, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls remember the commander-in-chief Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is not a little 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, vibrating staircase.
The doors in the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in the lights of the plastered places the street can be seen.
I think it's all on the honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's what it is."
Living in an 18th century wooden house is very difficult, - says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the state guard, but the money for its contents is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities just forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin-poor, but the foundation has ruined everything.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street and wash once a week in a public bathroom.
How can we be happy in such conditions?
The road runs right under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatyana moves the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: there is a flow of cars under the windows.
You see, the windows are always drooling, we can't open the windows, but we're used to the noise.
People get used to everything, the good and the bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
In addition, we have two rooms, we live three with our son.
And in other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general, the ceiling is just over one and a half meters high.
For contrast Tatyana offers to visit a neighbor from the apartment No. 6 Ludmile Starostina.
A nice welcoming woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: we are with husband and daughter with granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another place to live, - Lyudmila wraps her eyes around the room: the halls, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them was a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But from the ceiling flows regularly: the plumbing system is nowhere to be found.
Ludmila talks about her apartment everyday and surprisingly at the same time as an Italian, whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is, it brings into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former toilet.
We live exactly where Demidov lived with his family, on the second floor there were servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, so why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says that privatization doesn’t matter.
We'll only get a one-bedroom apartment, we can't claim more.
We were promised to relocate four months ago, but the promises didn’t go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived an entire dynasty: my grandmother with grandpa, mom with dad, me with husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the butterfly, they're metro-thick!
They say the solution has been mixed in the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
Maybe that's why no one's been killed by a broken ceiling or a broken roof.
Only the building still slowly dies in our eyes: the boards and beams of the houses rot, the floors repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like a well.
They say, and there is - under our room a secret loop and a walk to the White River, which was specifically made by the old-fashioned people who once lived here to be able to hide from danger, in case of anything.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to let him start an excavation in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them a place of residence in exchange for his one-room apartment on the avenue of October.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where are the four of us together?
And here at least there is a tiny hope that will give the housing more spacious.
We'd have agreed on the exchange, we wouldn't have won any more.
However, the family of the Elders did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream was to relocate them, and her daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter were given a separate room.
That is, a two-bedroom apartment was allocated for two families instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations now live.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two of us.
You can see what the conditions are.
The plaster is decomposed by pieces, as is the window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can be sure that the most fortunate spouses Lavrentyev from the apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
Room of 75 squares, prescribed for three people.
We live precisely in those rooms where according to legend Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks on the seams, collapses, collapses.
Neighbors must have already told us.
Most of the torture we have with the floor: the wooden boards were crushed, the ground was literally gone from under our feet.
I put brackets, wedges; there is nothing in the hall, and in another room we walk, like on wheelchairs, so all the hat.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any tour guide.
The goldsmith is treated as a native, he talks about it with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was unusual: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, poured guns and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of the merchant property are proud of their ancestor, but do not want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
At that time there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guardhouses, which were later removed.
In 1968, they wanted to take away our house, but something was...
The story repeated in 2014: once again seduced by a new home.
We, according to the team, collected all the documents, searched the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartment is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The residents did not accept it.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a smile, issued a paper without a signature and a print: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the residents."
I even had the feeling that our house has not been in the city for a long time, because first it was number 57, then became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It was as if it had been removed in the 1970s.
The “Russian Planet” turned to the leading sector of information and analytical work of the Ufa Land Resources Management Vladimir Barabbassh.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of old housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, only I know that at the time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully implemented.
Residents are planning to relocate to new apartments soon.
According to Barabbasas, the Demidov House will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
Houses will acquire a proper appearance, corresponding to that which was previously, three centuries ago.
Demidov’s house will most likely be a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, it was decided at the government level to make the street a pedestrian on weekends.
In the week, unfortunately, it will not work, too crowded roads in the city.
To displace people from the future of the museum, Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as their current ones.
Only from another epoch.
In Primorje, due to the storm, a forest fire began
A dry storm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting Area Forestry in the Pozhar district of the Primorsky Krai.
At the site of the fire, a grouping of forces and resources is being carried out.
According to the management of the KGSBU "Primorska Air Base", the conditions created on the site of the fire require the attraction of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Air Base:
The fire, which occurred in the hard-to-reach area, was detected by an observer pilot from the board of the patrol aircraft An-2 on an area of 3 hectares.
Burn the remains of wood on the old fireplace.
The strong coolness of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing parachute-firefields create significant difficulties in the demolition.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces at the disposal of the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the discovery of the fire, 4 fire paratroopers were deployed to the site of the slaughter.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and means of firefighting.
In the lunch area, 3 firefighters were additionally delivered by helicopter to the village.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of slaughter, the site of the administration of the Primorsky Region.
Lennie Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born into a family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry reprises the comedy, "Rare Records of Rudy", which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up from a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are life-threatening.
Henry, however, had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death there was "a lot" of treatment, moreover, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to a pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer cup, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a casting workshop in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to look at what his life was supposed to be.
Now there's a little better, but it's dark, smokey, deep labyrinths of heaven with fire and smoke and a bunch of seedlings.
My father went into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash away from the casting workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he did it for years and years to earn us food, and I started to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It was only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don France, allowed him to share the love he lacked in childhood.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They are still great friends with Frances, whom he has been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very cured and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been completely immersed in the theatre.
It was followed by "Comedy of Mistakes" and then by August Wilson's "Campaigns".
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black parody/comic on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had rights to the “Black and White Menstrual Show,” an easy entertainment program in which people “blackened their faces,” Henry discovered what was in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I don't think I ever want it to be with me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked on large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "a rewarded light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody on black people."
Representing characters who were ridiculing and chanting black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of "The Lennie Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, chef Geret Blacklock from the comedy series "Chef!".
The commercials, documentaries, TV series, and movies took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, you're going to be on your side."
Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 titled "What's good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergies to Shakespeare.
You can’t say I was taught this in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, a prerogative of middle-class white people with pantyhose and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't screw it up until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Otello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and he got stuck.
I felt like I could do that.
It's like my head's been fixed.
“This is what it is, this is a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
It seemed like they were waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the “Comedy of Mistakes.”
All of a sudden I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
“The quiet voice inside me said, ‘You’ll have to work 10 minutes while they make a computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else deal with it.
"You play the play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Zaborah" at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for the "Gatherings".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above showing, "Here's what you need to do."
He says it, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'll stick to that.
I really like it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has comics thinking - all the way through our conversation is interrupted by the bursts of his humor, when he starts it, then ends parodiing.
I just decided not to work at the stand, because this thing with getting instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you keep striving for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work on "Direct to Apollo" when I want to, but mostly I don't get the same pleasure as before.
I'm wondering if he'll give the stand a tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the journey – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give up on it.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's a fun time.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Registers Officials to Identify 'Invisible Workers'
Kenya has started the biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payment notice.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the government service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month is missing due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The government suspects that salaries continue to go into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must appear at the identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who does not do this without a respectable reason will be excluded from the payment notice, it is reported.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service, by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payment notice at both levels of the government's authority and the cabinet's structure - therefore, will put an end to the problem of "invisible workers", the effect is not.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies reported.
The police officers did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daley News.
Some of them took part in anti-corruption activities last December, which were aimed at screening government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized criminal group and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who at the time was prime minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power, the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told expectant journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony did not take place in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, the huge unified Ukrainian People’s Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that the children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In Ron's face, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a helm of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience working in managerial positions.
Her career began at Bain and Co’s global management consulting firm, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at Pearson's was taken over by a fellow man who held a lower position.
They say her earnings are approaching <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron, Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former advisor to Tori.
Earlier in May, I named the job of the president of the poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the very heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two directions: inside as the top level of the BBC’s executive hierarchy itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which requires a complete radical reform.
However, what kind of new president would risk coming, dismantling and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he himself lost his job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
If it wasn’t that difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size – after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, unavoidable licensing price negotiations pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in, by far, the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p a day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
BBC viewing and use models have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he's found him.
Perry from Texas Says Degrading Tweet Was Written by A Stranger
A tweet from Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry’s confirmed account on Sunday night contained an offensive image of a Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the record was debunked.
Just a tweet was posted from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I deleted it," the video said.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry’s confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually publishing on that tape.
The earlier tweet contained an inconvenient cartoon of Travis Rosemary Lemberg, a district attorney, who was found guilty of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her office when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury hearing in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
"I don't always drive a drunk car, three times the permissible level of alcohol in my blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry with telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Department did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
They were handled by Michael MacKrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and called the charges a political hoax.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law used to prosecute the governor who has been in office for the longest time in the history of Texas will float in violation of the constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to step down.
The veto sparked an official complaint from a social control group with left-wing views.
The ribbon of Perry’s confirmed account is often updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Arriving fifth at a party congress in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he could get out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake, and the words: "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley Reports The Real Estate Market Is Back To “Normal State”
One of London’s best-known developers has warned that the property market in south-east England has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of lively demand and fast-growing prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Piggy, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to its normal level of transactions since its peak in 2013,” adding that this provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market thrived during the decline as foreign buyers drove to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 per cent in just one year, according to the Earth Cadastral, significantly exceeding the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable, and student Berkeley schemes rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also halted the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "house tax" ahead of the general election.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced tougher conditions for lending, would also result in a year-on-year decline in market growth as a purchase and sale of such properties.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has lowered its forecast of a rise in London real estate prices in 2015 to 3% based on the fact that the setting of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in London’s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital proved to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: “The demand for the right product with good design and a better location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales remained for the time being.”
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April – almost a third more than at the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual earnings before taxes rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, and revenues by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said Berkeley’s expected revenues for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected for the entire year before the payment of taxes in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The Berkeley stock price stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the second half of the day on the London Stock Exchange.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Academy of Cinematography.
Photographs of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a “catalog” of photographs of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesperson for Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photographs were real, and condemned the hacker for a "sudden invasion of private space."
There has been a call to law enforcement, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing site, are believed to have been obtained due to a lack of Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the hack includes the names of Dozens of female celebrities, including Mbee and Mbee.
It’s unclear how many of these photos are genuine, though the star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. All” Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“Those who look at the photos we took with my husband a few years ago, alone at home, I hope you’re proud of yourself,” Winsted tweeted.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria-Winner" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of naked me FALSHYVKI, people.
Let me stop it in the womb. *Calambour intentional*.
Buzzfeed said on Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande’s representative had denied that the photos she was supposed to be in were genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s new novel about love and the letter ‘J’, which aroused critical acclaim
They dissolved, best to say just that, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box they left under the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, too hard to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she squeezed his hand.
He saw irritation in himself.
He was like a squirrel, yes.
The last victim of this turmoil was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual, to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eilynn Solomons was a shiveringly brittle beauty with braided hair and a shivering heart from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, with the latter inheriting a house in a raw, but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes ran, the spiders were stationary in the baths, the mucous membranes left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was full of weeds, resembling giant cabbage sprouts.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both scary and charming, with a full secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the long list of the Buker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilinn were sitting in a chair, holding hands, in broken armchairs amidst tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; both of them were dispersed to the cheap console, which provided the country with music, peace of mind, and peace of mind.
You've got too big legs.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, the songs of this type on the console no longer lost.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just didn’t lose anymore.
They helped to become archaic, as the word "archaic" itself.
Public taste did what would never be achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among the books, people chose the memories of the rich, grown up in poverty, cookbooks, and love novels, from all the music they chose ballads.
Enjoying this day, Cavern began to play the imaginary piano and to sing Eileen's big legs with a rough comic voice.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically applying two fingers to her lips.
So his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she landed off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with the word "J" and forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew what was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen's never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, although he wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one "if" left in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with oysters.
Its unpredictability affected people's nerves.
And jazz was a sharpness, expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, having never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of CDs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembers a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
Society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude – thanks to those who were doomed by fate – with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent on temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The Indians, as if by nature they were talented in everything related to electronics, made sure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was a plate.
Those who came from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not hasten to leave the country, when that which had been done, if it had been done entirely, had not been done, and the fear of being accused of burning, in fear, in their own.
Everyone in terms of capabilities.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Eileen was hard to understand how the insulting words that Caverne had just uttered to her could have been put to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he adored this song.
He said too much, but the started garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could have penetrated through the sound insulation of giant cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to squeeze two fingers at her lips again.
She already thought it was weird.
“It was funny,” he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, shutting down Keverna's review.
In general, there was nothing in the world except her black-haired dwarf.
There's nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
She seemed to be really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The squirrels, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He might have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
“I like you precisely because you have thick ankles,” he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him to awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm that could alleviate the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Keverne, wanted to.
In spite of the good eyes.
Aileenn Solomons blushed and got up from the lounge, rinsing the console and pouring the wine they drank.
The wine was made out of wine, so the drinking could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
“And I like you because you have a stupid head,” she said.
Even if you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that she was basically the same as hers.
The same huge icy ocean crashed on both of them.
The same smuggled men, even more sensitive and capricious after what they have done, if they have done as a whole as their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers have been driven in anger from the pub to the pub, ready to raise the women.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid cock if she wasn't careful!
First they would kiss - a kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote from the fresh ballads issued by the console - first to kiss her, and then to hit her.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Keverne, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons' body showed that he needed to leave.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched as he was leaving, and from the top window she looked as he was leaving, her companion was a man who had released his burdens.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt the infusion of compassion towards him and the men in general, though some of them raised their hand at her.
The man who turned away from her, with a bent back, shy, beaten, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember any case, until today, when she would see it like that?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or about that Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher, who worked at the Offnau, the unofficial service of control of the public mood, has been in the news, has prepared a small report on the preservation of the low and medium level.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has been done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggression of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and the slender slenderness of the area, where, despite the pairings of the slenderness, it is not a good thing.
However, some of the qualities, it turns out, are inexhaustible.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it generates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows the stories of overcome obstacles and declares its strong faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness of the nods and nods of the nods retains its strong hold in the fields, as in the rural communities, and so on.
“You have a boring habit of writing too much,” said her scientific director, reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read less of the novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Quiet again.
“I’m asking,” said Luther Rabinovic, “not because I’m against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any prejudices here.
We are the servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as the ones you showed me.
It is obvious that you yourself are preconceived against the church, and what you call “evil” and “rough” others would interpret as an expression of natural love of life and energy.
To continue to complain about what has been done, if it has been done in general, as if it had been done, if it had been done at all yesterday, is to deprive a country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinovic was speaking.
Behind his head pink, like flamingo, LED letters repeated the tips that Ofnau gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your wife, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you want to say,” said Esme Nussbaum quietly, when she confirmed that her scientific director had finished saying, “and I don’t want to say anything other than that we haven’t healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I’m concerned that if we’re not ready, we’ll find that we’re repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened, if anything else.
Only this time we will throw out our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinovic connected the tips of his fingers into a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean infinite patience.
“You go too far,” he said, calling it “mistakes” of actions that our grandparents did or didn’t do.
You go too far and when you say that they have thrown their “anger” and “distrust” into “others.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There were no “us” and there were no “others.”
It was a time of unrest - that's all we know.
"For which, if you are honest with yourself," she dared to put Esme, "not a single part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it’s good or bad, what’s done is done.
It was then.
There’s nothing else to say, here we agree.
And as no one should be blamed, no one should be excused if it were appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not for the sake of learning--
The past is there to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to this -
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovich collapsed.
“I’ll look into your report,” he said, releasing it.
The next day, on the way to work, she was shot down by a motorcyclist who went out onto the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in an angry rage."
Accidents happen.
Lesotho’s army says no coup was planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of Lesotho's army have denied the fact of preparing a coup in order to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against the police, whom they suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane has left the country, saying the country's army has surrounded its official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, saying he had been threatened with an assassination attempt.
Army spokesman Major Ntelle Ntoy said there was not, in fact, a coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho has taken action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that have been, in fact, the elements that are ready to arm some of America's political, young political fanatics.
A representative of the South African government, Clayson Monela, said the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
Representatives of the army of Lesotho reported that the soldiers returned to barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing is running the government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his unified government.
He said his actions were not undermined by the government, despite accusations in reverse.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on the rental rights at Milan, Milan Channel reports.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he was on the field at the London club only three times.
Recall that previously "Milan" rented from "Liverpool" attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at the lowest rate in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the eurozone manufacturing sector’s business activity index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The figures came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect from the bank a clear plan on how to cope with the eurozone’s recession, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of only 0.3%.
There is a presumption that ECB leader Mario Draghi may be giving additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the repressive effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to raise real concerns, as does Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has gone largely by the industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,” Mr. Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to fuel analysts who are looking forward to the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August study of the Eurozone manufacturing sector business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “The eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current rising geopolitical tensions – especially those related to Russia/Ukraine – add to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This rising tension has obviously hit the business — and especially the consumer confidence — and is likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that “it is increasingly similar” that the ECB will, of course, eventually have to carry out some sort of quantitative easing, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
The inhabitants of Mariupol will set up a live chain against militiamen
In Mariupol until last week, everything was calm - no one dared to organize the Mariupol People’s Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are horrifyingly awaiting the arrival of the militiamen.
According to political scientists, separatists break into Mariupol to go out to the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which was not part of the self-proclaimed republics before.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will defend them, but its forces have little against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig graves, build blockades and fortifications.
In the evening on Saturday, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the hymn of Ukraine.
They will do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs stop working.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible seizure of school, as children who have been in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death during the atrocities at school.
Exactly ten years after the terrible takeover of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children, heroically survivors of the disaster warned yesterday evening of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed to be something of an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy brought the East and the West together in resentment, which surprisingly grew into action and hope for the future in conditions of more severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during the atrocities at the school.
We have found amazing young people who have faced hardships, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Is it their greatest hope?
That the war that is now raging in Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now cease.
The girl who in the photo is trying to get back to the shooting gym
It was captured in a photo of famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when she tried to get back into the shooting gym in one of her underwear after the mine exploded.
In confusion, Aida desperately sought her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them died, but in fact they survived.
“The woman told me to run, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and used to go back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few slits left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she said.
“It happened to me, and I can’t change that fact.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Zera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed that we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and get to work.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture remains with her, although the memories fade a little each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and around the world.
When I see a picture on the internet where I climb into a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure that it doesn’t happen again.
The boy who ran through the city of bullets, believing his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start schooling at age 7) and survived three days of capture, embracing his mother Tamaru.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Afraid that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran across the city with a bullet.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed the son outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with injuries to her legs, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, “I was crying with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now non-existent News of the World), where he was awarded as a Child Protector from Barnardo's Foundation Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Shery.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my memory it will fade away.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say that they are killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted, and a ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars are leading to the kind of pain that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry to all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who volunteered at the women’s monastery last week.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve in the police one day and I hope that I will be enrolled in the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence right after the capture, there were just no children who would scream and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She clearly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I was telling our story.
I understood then how people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sheryl Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheryl and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them from his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month since our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I still don’t think this world has gotten any better in the last 10 years.
There is a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive and not evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but they’re very close to six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it — I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn’t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he is above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember yelling at him, ‘Damir, run, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture has become a defining factor in the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Beslan survivor Georgiy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and Georgiy's right today
His bloody face had a scare print when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot at his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of the nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George was able to make it through.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
A photograph of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in sculpture (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school that day, that he said he wanted to embrace the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the crying George in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this photo, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt that we will ever find out the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating the crash of Boing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what she was called to do?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this is happening because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it’s happening.
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
It takes us decades to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago I had nightmares because of capture, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgiy Farniev, 20 years
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist-killer
Incredible: George Farniev was at the foot of a terrorist-killer at the time of the capture, but he still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist-killer.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“It seems to us that it was even yesterday,” says Georgii, who wanted to study as an FSB intelligence officer but was unable to because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgiy Farniev today with a photo of himself in the hospital after the capture on his laptop
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normal.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical records, and they said it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I know I’ll never tell my kids about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
For him, it has to be even stronger because he was there, and I am not.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn’t help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan the prints are on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many of my friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only exacerbates my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children are born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're at war now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could take all the rebels and throw them away as far as you can.
Alyona Tkayeva, 10 years old
A baby who has been moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alenu Tskayev is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a monstrous crime at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian policeman took little Aljona out of a school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was rescued, but Alenina's mother and sister were killed in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, which he named Kristina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and flourished into a smart and cheerful girl, the neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Aljona and Mahar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a wonderful father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Shinzi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, said he was looking forward to being able to get back on the pitch in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will be playing for Borussia again,” Kagava said.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and I look forward to being able to get back on the field in the form of Borussia.
Kagawa moved to the "MYU" from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to establish himself in the English club, having held in two seasons only 38 matches in the English championship, scoring 6 balls and giving 8 resulting transmissions.
Man accused of hiring a girl at the pedestrian crossing “pelican” in Fife
The 78-year-old man will face trial on charges of driving a three-year-old girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot a girl at a crossing at Pittenwine in East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and stabbed the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstrutter, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, has set a court date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande won't close in Vladivostok
Vladivostok Airport’s duty-free trade store Duty Free has issued a billboard prohibiting a number of world political leaders from making purchases at this store.
Don't overcook them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store administration has decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known comrades will not be able to cook vodka, cognac and spirits.
And I hung the appropriate plate on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on appearing in an even less accessible type of establishment - Dietetic Food Institutes, as reported by the website of food establishments.
Whether the U.S. president ever dreamed of eating in a dietary dining room in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly foolish.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo conditions, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to set up the production of the varieties demanded by buyers.
The advice was given during the visit of the company "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurants to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the right level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the team of Russia Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the tournament DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes have performed at their level, - brings "The whole sport" Maslakov's words.
The third place is the confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It is important to note that we are not prepared for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not committed our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the team.
The French, on the other hand, set up a combat-capable team that included 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the owners of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order lower than in the same "Brilliant League".
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is no longer so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, it is agreed, it came to absurd, when at 1500 meters men were so fascinated by tactical tricks of running that they showed the result below the average level... of women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve the best quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or shoot a video underwater, you have a number of hardware options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof “soap” such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a few cameras, all for around $350.
Regardless of which equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check out your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
In addition, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be shooting.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object-type modes that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our buyer's guide and ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because a lot of them won't get.
Soapboxes have LCDs that will help you compose photos, while action cameras don’t usually have them.
Even if you have a bladder, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the composition of the frame will be an accidental process.
So make a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that captures multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, take advantage of them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay on the surface when shooting in a pool, river or ocean.
This will also allow you to transmit more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Move closer to the filming objects.
This is a great tip for filming on land, but it’s even more important underwater because of the dim light conditions.
Particularly important if you’re shooting on an action camera: This camera is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to approach the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games for free wrestling Bilal Mahov can go into Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by the head coach of the Dagestan team for the free fight Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete in the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Billal Makhov is at the gathering of the team "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" Sajid Sajidov.
In general, according to juniors, Billyal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he became the winner of the Voluntary Tournament and the third winner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free fight.
It has long been said that the new stage of his career will carry out our heavyweight in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Makhov can perform already at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the prize.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff led by Goga Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality could shake everything around him, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
A consultant anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to ridding patients of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who addressed him, his wife recalls, was an MI-6 officer, who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are fascinated by diagnoses and diseases, those who are undergoing treatment mainly worry about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel as usual,” he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he discovers that he is irritatingly insulting his wife, Juliet.
“I want things to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left for business for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unclear as to why he was upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked a colleague to have a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results have arrived.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lung lining.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a “miracle,” but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry-recommended ban came into effect.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe insulators, builders, butchers and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
The UK, it turns out, is today at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality rate of approximately 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease as a result of car accidents.

The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were, ultimately, prohibited by law in 1999), mesotheliomas usually go on for decades.
And attack mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, deposited in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
Bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The Parliament building is punctuated with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have been the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he thought.
“It looks like there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Guy Hospital, where I spent six years internships,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and truckers - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer to.
“Of the four doctors who were interns at the Guy hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years,” he said in a letter in 2010, “I was left alive alone.”
How many of us will get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lausanne’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to Professor Julian Pito, the UK’s leading mesothelioma expert, it is likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the UK’s asbestos epidemic is expected to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t realize they’re going to die that way.

A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack on mesotheliomas has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had accidentally contacted Janice Ellen with asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working for M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years old.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew of asbestos.
I couldn’t even think that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, outdoor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are solid, albeit indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK].”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a patient study, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma when there is no known exposure at work or at home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment.”
Much of this impact, he says, is due to “normal use and the impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the very center of the government, could be affected unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could cause the movement of something as harmless as "strong air flows."
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Parliament’s Directorate of Technical Services2 insisted that the Westminster Palace received a “pure sanitary certificate”, it now acknowledged that it is necessary to carry out <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work on the reconstruction of the parliament, which will be all-in-one, improving the electricity, and removing the asbestos.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to various rules.”
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do right now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is that it was a day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I started to get a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I didn’t think I could go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the shells around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he couldn’t go to work for a month.
The tasked doctors made X-rays of the chest and put pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it for analysis.
However, his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he was in sports and had a hard time breathing.
In 2011, one of Ebbott's patients came to him in a reception room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma".
However, even then, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his physician showed his CT results and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he said.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosed
Suddenly Abbott drowned in a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation was quite often on the pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes in hospitals were in the basements, so it’s unlikely that patients will get injured.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a life-threatening threat to the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos stand
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and mayors because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos stand.
There are websites that focus on the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roofs of sheds usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison deposited in a huge number of our buildings,” says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of the garden hall in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful, wear the garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
“It takes a long time to realize this,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I don't see Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor to the patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how he was shot with the amount of information he had to take.
“It was hard to understand everything,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life – the act of breathing itself – that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesotheliomas are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and fibers inhale, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises because of the inhalation of the needle fibers of asbestos,” Professor Tom Trager, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to the hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
Tracer knew Lauson and treated some of the others, who were probably exposed to it by internships in the hospital.
When asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treger says, "the breath pushes them to the periphery where the shell is.
This is, in essence, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatments for other cancers are much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, provokes hot quarrels.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Carrier disagrees.
"You can't cut the pleura," he says.
It is impossible to approach it with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is “not very well-suited to chemotherapy,” which “works” but does not cure.
“From time to time, there are patients who live a long time,” says Trager.
But in the end, they all die.
Luckily, some patients live a lot, a lot longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, became a single support and counseling bureau for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott said.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by only a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "said to give everything a little more positive color."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loyk Lang-Lazdunsky, a professor of thoracic surgery at Gaia Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need direction, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get guidance and approval for the funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatments are ultimately inevitably ineffective, many patients face yet another financial cause for concern – about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that we talked about the infidelity of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement," Morgan said, as Lawson could not unambiguously prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After his death was investigated, the representative of the Guy hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement rooms in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking lethal contact with asbestos to a single company or workplace — usually decades later — has been a major problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers either switched owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that on their side time, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, this year there have been serious new legislative acts that make it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund financed by the insurance industry was created for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who can't argue with.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if they hadn’t intervened in the interim and mesothelioma patients could trace the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Pensions, acknowledged that the law was “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
“People are suffering so much, and they need help today,” Penning said during Bill’s second reading of mesothelioma last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loyk Lang-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Trager, he considered to be effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy – a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunsky boasts about 40 percent of the patients who survived in five years.
Abbott felt the tide of force.
“This, of course, is one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few [cancer] spots in my chest.
I should have just turned 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are no more tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things – about finances when I die, for example, or what you have to show your wife how the timer works on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you become disheartened.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for the parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease, which means I wouldn’t live until old age.
They reacted in a very different way.
Thames is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something that you have to face with all the cancers.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a ray of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, ultimately, for Steven Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of balsamized pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos tissues.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the pot and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a canvas is invented, which does not ignite.
I saw the napkins made out of it floating in the fireplaces at the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are consequently denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochedale.
Dr. William Cook points out that the particles of asbestos in her lungs "were, without a doubt, the leading cause of death."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw employees, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding was developing intensively, one of the most deadly occupations in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The appellate court confirms the first successful health claim caused as a result of contact with asbestos in the UK.
Global asbestos production grows to more than 4213000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in the UK requires all contractors working with asbestos to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was adopted in the UK.
A compensation scheme of <0xC2><0xA3>350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at the level of approximately 2 million tons per year.
China Refuses to Give Hong Kong the Right to Elect Leaders; Protesters Swear to Revenge
China’s parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to run for office in the 2017 election, despite mounting demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the All-China Assembly of People’s Representatives, in essence, allows the Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t mislead our expectations, but it still leads to anger,” said lawmaker Emily Law, the Democratic Party’s chairman.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People’s Representatives, said it would be too “chaotic” to allow the public to run for the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to vote for the head of government starting in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kong people the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the upcoming Commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong occurred over many years.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block Hong Kong’s financial district unless Beijing guarantees this universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently, in an attempt to avoid problems with the state authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the possibility of capturing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to report that, at present, all the opportunities for dialogue and capture of the central area will undoubtedly be exhausted.
State authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures have been stepped up at government headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations are endangered by Hong Kong’s business life force.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to spread concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is an idea that is bad for investment.
China’s state media has also reported in recent days that Hong Kong’s democratic movement activists have been shown by Western-led divergents.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The American culture of graduate scores reaches university life: first-year students are offered to arrive on a private plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first in the UK “Luxury” category travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal plane, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping students reach the university this year with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The company’s representative said that since the service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that despite the fact that students have to pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 a year for their education, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Today’s students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is just what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students has criticized this service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President of Higher Education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start studying at the university this month are faced with a cost-of-living crisis when the available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the fast-growing expenditures of the bulk of those basic needs before they can begin to think about it at all.
Feminists raise the issue of racial affiliation and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of an unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists, who left comments, put gender over racial affiliation when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West grew and attracted national attention, Peres saw white women’s responses, which focused 100 per cent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as "Thoughts about Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
It’s very symbolic of the crisis we’ve been facing, and because [the Ferguson situation] is so tied to racial affiliation, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson has uncovered the problems that black Americans face every day, but that are not perceived as "female problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
“Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of racial affiliation and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now uniting issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Heather, a professor of women’s and gender research at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and almost always rape of a white woman was the basis for this,” said Hetter.
It took a white woman confirming the story to justify lynching.
From Hetter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for the right to vote would be effective only for one of the groups: women or black.
“They decided to put all the eggs into the basket of women’s voting rights, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later,” said Hetter.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
This group emerged almost 40 years after black women for the first time asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation – police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “fix” the problems that black women could not cope with.
“Would it be great if activists who have such a [traditional] feminist ideology were as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception?” asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Stein two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown took advantage of Facebook and published a cutting-edge article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in the protests.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger involved in the body – and views on racial issues that are significantly different in public surveys – will be at the forefront of change,” she wrote.
Although Steinem advocates more cross-cutting feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
Researcher at the American Entrepreneurship Institute Christina Summers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?” said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the remarks by Stein against Ferguson.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “Watch My Brother” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking young people, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that advances the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that in order to present this issue as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued to [male immigrants], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a response from women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with a pig" for sale
The photo of the house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
On sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, a detached one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - on which was depicted a pig with a head resting on the sofa.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been removed," the company's representative said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as "a unique one-bedroom detached house".
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still retained in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest in social media, where some asked if the pig was sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round match of the US Open relinquished Karolin Voznyatsky, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to end the year with dignity and try to get to a new level, reports Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How will you assess your overall results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad we managed to win the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the finals of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even get to the quarter-finals.
What tasks do you have until the end of the season?
After an offensive defeat, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.

The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will bring to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at the round table, which was held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan is made on behalf of the government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, Pluzhnikov says, the proposed measures concerning electric cars and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gasoline fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (the copy is in "Vedomosti") is intended for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe the tax and customs measures of support of electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will be developed by April 2015; and the introductory will be made proposals for the reduction of the price of cars, and the stimulus of the lo.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to make changes to regulatory acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 so that they also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of giving it an advantage when moving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals for expansion.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators of evaluation of the activity of regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric cars in Russia is just forming - in 2013, about 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will be about 500, predicts Mitsubishi Motors chief executive officer in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold increase does not make electric cars any more noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
At the moment, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company is primarily focused on corporate customers, says Nikolai Remyz, Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships at Renault in Russia.
Most of the other producers of electric transport have taken a waiting position in relation to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the production is poor.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-Holding, AutoVAZ released 30 electric cars.
Demand is low due to the cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of "AvtoVAZ" in engineering Sergei Amanov, without the state support of the breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the cost of cars (the electric vehicles that are sold in Russia, on average twice the price of analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the indevelopment of the Sligo charging infrastructure.
Due to the cost and low rates of reduction in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of "Author" Mikhail Podorohyansky, Zelikov agrees with him.
Car manufacturers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of ordinary.
The Russian market of electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing - to inspire confidence in consumers that "electronic mobility" is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state-owned company "Rossetti": in Moscow several stations have been built, soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations on the construction of the tanker network are also underway with other regions.
According to the director of the department "Rossetey" Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the market of electric cars and is ready to build tanks all over the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a uniform standard for charging electric cars of different brands.
In addition, "Rossetti" as a network company do not have the right to deal with the sale of electricity, an opportunity is being developed to do so in terms of charging electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation in Russia of the market of electric vehicles to zero customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, extension of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing transport tax to environmental tax (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as sensitive as customs preferences, according to Pankov.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - they now account for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as already done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars along designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
The single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three out of five people in it have died, according to Itar-Tass.
Survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the city of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
The Donetsk region deals with prisoners of the Donbass battalion.
The caravans were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of soldiers were killed under shelling.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine really was, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called the lucky ones.
The caravans from the Donbass battalion remained alive after that "meat shove" they fell under Ilovaisky.
Around the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, effectively abandoned by their commanders and authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that it was possible to exit the "ring" along the supposedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally a few minutes later, bullets and bullets were fired from all sides.
"According to the information given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed out," said the deputy commander of the battalion, who has a summons "Lermontov".
And when we went down between Multipol and Chervosselsky, a crossfire started with anti-tank missiles, with "tanks", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, BMD automatic guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, only two cars left.
The officer with the call of "Lermontov" tells: almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died already afterwards.
Survivors are now being given medical care by those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, drugs.
At a time when their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to faithful death.
“We’ve just been betrayed,” they say.
Column, the whole battalion to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei became a volunteer, because in the Ukrainian news was told about the atrocities that allegedly committed in the southeast "separatists".
Alexis has already seen a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk – not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar shelling, that it is most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written a report about the departure.
We were immediately transported to Ilovaisk with the collections from Zurahovo.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the “cot” under Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they wouldn’t have entered the penal battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR soldiers.
Everyone will be inspected for involvement in war crimes.

Twitter Is Trying To Be More Interesting For New Users
Twitter’s microblogging service has changed the process of registering users to more quickly involve new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will be browsing a large number of accounts recommended by the service during the registration process to immediately compose their reading cycle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated when registering.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets a subscription check box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to remove the hooks themselves manually, so as not to read those who are not interested.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter is taking a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter’s registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on upgrading the service.
Such activity is primarily related to the continued efforts of the service to achieve innocence.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
At the moment, the company desperately needs a greater number of loyal consumer resources, which, once in a while, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.

From September 1, the program for the recycling of cars is resumed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other directions of support.
The program will affect all cars over the age of six.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a light car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Previously, a similar car recycling program had already been in place in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, explained the minister, is that now it is assumed not only the disposal of the machines to receive a subsequent discount, but also the possibility in case the car reaches the age of more than six years.
More than 16 billion rubles have been spent on the previous federal recycling program, which ran from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, famous for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release the game about modern journalism.
He talked about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but the fact gained widespread popularity only now.
A source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where now there are protests that began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how informational illumination of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes occur between the police and the population.
The hero can photograph what is happening in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene in such a way that the policemen will look like heroes, and the protesters are gangsters, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where the ordinary man cannot go.
If he illuminates events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale uprising.
Points in the game will need to be scored using the hero's twitter, in which new followers will appear, if the photos posted there will prove popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image that demonstrates how an event can change depending on how a photograph of it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to enlighten the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media illuminate the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which tells the story of events from Case’s own biography, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his relationships to homophobic parents.
Heletey attracts Ukraine in continuation of bloodshed
With a call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Helety draws the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“In Moscow, of course, they paid attention to the remarks of the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletey, who declared the “complete operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine from the terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, in which the “losses” will be counted.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the mentioned post on his Facebook page, is the subject for the study of specialists not in the military field," - said in the message of Russian diplomats.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of the civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the defense minister of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On the unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he said that the “operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine” was completed.

The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayut (right) appointed to the post of Minister of Defense Right Wongsuvana (left)
Thailand's military ruler and Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-Ocha has announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of posts are held by retired generals or generals.
Representatives of the army were given key positions: Ministers of Defense, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-ocha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the king of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government for that post.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the premiership.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army had appointed deputies to parliament.
According to Prayuta Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six-month-long demonstrations during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat’s government.
Officially, Prayut Chan-Ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22nd.
against the backdrop of complete civil power paralysis.
The leaders of the main political parties were subject to temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they put the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat, under temporary arrest.
Several journalists and public figures were also arrested.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army resigned from the post of Prime Minister of Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Takshin.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern parts of the country, which has ensured them success in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, a waitress from the new Palm brasserie is sniffing.
It must be formally acknowledged that this is indeed the case, but the mind and stomach remain impermanent.
After all, we all know for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean media, we say "media" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurateurs like to say that the success of the establishment depends on three factors: it is location, location and once again location.
There are places that are located not only to be good, but even excellent, but some unfortunate.
In short, sitting at the table of Palm, I remembered that there was once a cafe "City" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Bojole" and a beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg was located above the ground: a bar stand and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is deprived even of a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of the windows - TVs, where the mermaid girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are not new for a long time, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of pouring beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and an innumerable number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "midias are full big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some drawbacks, - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected by the content, but often very unexpected by the execution.
Well, who, for example, is given to predict that the meat roulette with Walloon blacksmith (280 rubles) - in fact carpaccio, cut to the same thin, that the parchment paper in comparison with it will look ugly stuff.
You can feel at least some taste, only if you warm up half a plate together.
The salads are even worse.
The classic Leyen (260) would be most right to admit a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of ugly iceberg, cooked once long ago potatoes, crushed Kenyan beans, coated bacon chips plus mari.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a lily salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If it was still possible to close your eyes on the immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or roasted champignons, then why do midi look like they have been able to freeze and cook several times in their lives!
I already know that there are quite normal Belorussian midi here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The sauces of half a dozen, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, clearly did not ask.
There are vegetables, and the aroma is missing, and whether there was wine there remains a mystery.
But there are good midi fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken watermelon here is not a loaf of bread, thick to such an extent that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, and just a nice cream soup.
It was stated that the rabbit is a local chef cooking in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On verification, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary silenced everything.
It was thought that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during his life, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the rabbit's leg was attached to a wonderful - no, just an annulled pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also rich - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be excessively watery, and the waffles are dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the lunch impressions.
So we should come back again.
The exchange rate of the dollar has risen above 37 rubles on the news of the West’s impending new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar in the calculations "tomorrow" at 10:29 MSK grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the price of the euro rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to the data of the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The binary currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar reached a high on February 19, 2009 – then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House said U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions on Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this mark, - says senior analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Everything related to Ukraine, in one way or another, will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today rumors about the invasion of the troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market has turned out to be very emotional.
All the conversations that he was resilient to such news yesterday were overwritten.
The week, according to the forecast of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all connections of one chain.
Inflation is also forecast to accelerate: the current prices for autumn will increase from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and there will be some vacuum, while the networks are reorientated to other suppliers.
“The dollar reached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there is no powerful hysteria,” commented the head of the market analysis department of Opening Broker Konstantin Bushuev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then went news about Ukraine, in addition, last week the Central Bank said that by the end of the year it is completely moving to the floating rate and abandoning any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, then it was nothing different from the previous one during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Worrying times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, when there was an elevated demand for the currency at the end of January, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of the currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue portion of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the cost of imports, says UFS IC chief analyst Alexei Kozlov.
Negative points can be attributed to the travel of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provoke the growth of inflationary pressure and, as a result, become the cause of the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, inhibits the development of countries.
When it comes to the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble slightly smooths the fall in the price of shares, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday’s trades, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative amount of index decline is due to the weakening of the ruble over the course of the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is of an emotional nature and is explained by the massive desire to buy a currency.
As practice shows, the emotions gradually go away, and the ruble quotes partially or fully restore the lost positions.
"We assume that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," - says Alexey Kozlov.
A genetic disorder is often incorrectly diagnosed.
The British woman said she spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she only had a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Mari-Tuta disease (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that lead to damage to nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
The charity CMT UK reported that incorrectly diagnosed is a common problem among people with MS because so little is known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have SMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and squeezed toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Frederick’s (AF) attack – a condition for which the prognosis was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboard with other kids, and I had a lot of bullying in school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room and it was written that she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I pushed my nose where it shouldn’t be, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I came home, found information about the condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic as possible.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have this disease because you’d already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you have something that poses much less of a threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have SMT.
“When he explained what an SMT was, I thought I was pulling a happy ticket,” she said.
The UK charity SMT has announced a month of information on SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington area is growing as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
Accounts for state and local-level tax payments for companies across the country have risen moderately last year, as the recovery of the economy accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia combined paid $27.6 billion into the state treasury and locally in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on business by state and local level increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after year-on-year when accounts fell in 2009.
Taxes levied by the state rose faster, 4.3 percent more than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by a company providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a policy group.
More than half of the county’s tax revenues, 56 percent, are taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36% of Maryland’s tax revenues are taxed on firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
The rise in tax revenues is largely driven by a return to the company’s previous value level, the researchers say, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when the growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large portion of these revenues come from large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return of real estate value does not have any similar effect on the growth of tax revenues by the state and at the local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies’ tax accounts.
The companies of Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of the tax bills per state and locally in the form of property taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay taxes on real estate,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs’ incomes also appear to be being adjusted, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion compared to 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the largest in the region.
Although the trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the country-average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average, equal to 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax in the three jurisdictions (each of which had the same corporate rate) equal to 6%.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25%, while in the county it is relatively high – 9.975%.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs by state and local level and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbours from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a law that lowers the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, the law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs up to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, the small business in the Washington area seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure that most small firms are based on - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia have increased by 20 percent in the previous year.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country are likely to continue this year, with revenues from turnover taxes in state and local governments rising by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period.
However, the Washington area may be lagging behind, as the fall in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world judo championship brought two silver and seven bronze awards to the Russian national team.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave up only the main favorite of the competitions - the team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ghanbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament became the most successful for the team of Russia - on Tuesday were won three medals immediately.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg silver was awarded to Mikhail Puliaev, and bronze - Kamala Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian conceded to the 2011 and 2013 world champions of Japan, Massai Abinume.
Han-Magomedov, who lost the compatriot in the quarter-finals, won the consolation tournament and became the holder of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg also up to the third step of the pedestal, Natalya Kuzyutina achieved the honor.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current world champion Milinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at that championship played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute over the bronze, Kuzyutina won from Ma Inan of China, but after the end of the tournament admitted that the third place is not what she expected.
And again, a barrier on the Russian's path to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutin earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov placed the bronze in the copier of the Russian national team, fighting in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was former Moldovan representative Viktor Skovortsov, now representing the UAE team.
However, the Russian then won two fights and became the winner of the prize.
Mogushkov performed at the home championship with a gallbladder injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who accepted UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze finished the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the World Cup 2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifontov won in the category of up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he won the Frenchman Alan Schmitt with a remark.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played at once, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Q&A, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: its competitor for the consolation final was Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the opponent Qusov was not able to get out on the pats due to the injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the squad of Renat Saidov, who performed in the category more than 100 kg.
In the comforting final, he won a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
This is how the individual part of the world championship ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both men's and women's - were one of the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, representatives of the beautiful sex were not lucky - they did not reach the medal.
But the Russian judoists won the command silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they gave up the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan in a persistent struggle with an account of 2-3.
At the same time, the team of Russia led 2-0 after the clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and the will - Denis Yarcev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals were not able to cope with Murat Khabachirov (81), Mohammed Mahomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament was developed, where the Russian team, having 2-0, surrendered to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was present the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was seen that you could become champions," Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, to the parents of the judo - there is nothing empty here.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
The Russian team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, the Russian team had only three medals – one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isayev.
We are all, of course, great maximists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential Olympic winner.
Especially in this kind of sport as judo", - summed up the results of the tournament the Minister of Sport of the Russian Federation Vitali Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The team of Japan is expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different merit, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

The Joan Rivers family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at the Mount Sinai hospital on Thursday after an emergency call about her having had a heart attack at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources say.
Doctors intentionally keep her under anesthesia and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy".
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripe.
All the kings can.
In the sale of the group's debut album Royal Blood - a new hope of the British rock, which brought the rock duets from the clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo has been on stage for a year, but has already been actively nominated for a BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour with the Arctic Monkeys, and a visit to a New York concert by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name, a few months before the release, received 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current lamentable situation in the music market, the situation is out of range, because we are not talking about the new Lane Del Rey or another sweetheart representative of the "new R'n'B" mound, but about a duet of bullfighters in the form of Britons playing with them.
In general, the bets on the first album due to all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and already quite justified.
The duo took a name that could have been touched before, except for the desperate hairdressers, and the blood of the kings, they think, flows in their veins, is also clear.
It is, of course, above all about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood sets its goal to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise so far, perhaps, early, but something can already be affirmed.
A dozen songs set in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer’s gift, but a confident and powerful statement of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to smash than to smash.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing record composition "Better Strangers" with Shakespeare's quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a hard rock fan party, but when they lose in a row they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it’s not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (more likely to be the successors of Motörhead), but have taken numerous rock duets out of the ghetto of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, is obviously tight.
The secret is in part the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also the approach to songwriting itself.
The heroes of the retrorock of zero with great difficulty went beyond the postmodernist paradigm, with a huge unwillingness to recognize themselves not just as epigons, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and sharp that this effort successfully taps some of the secondaryity and rigidity of the musical material.
After all, who said rock must be smart?
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store – and a video producer, and a hundred other things – is buying a streaming video playback service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because nobody expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a good billion looked complete, and that combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be a streaming service of a general nature – a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time gaming,” according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", the genre of videos, in which all-knowing give (mainly, old) games processing, as in "The Mystery Theater", is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met without much interest, a classic example of a rooted technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It’s a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, according to available information, it was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shire: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim that it is better to play sports than to watch it, find it difficult to understand the attractiveness of watching games rather than taking a joystick in their own hands.
It’s one thing to look through a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and it’s another thing to watch a stranger get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games that you can watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching their shooting without controlling the angle of view on their own can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speedy passages in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age complete the entire game in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not about game virtuosity or humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
What do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.
How does Amazon make money from this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will roll over to Amazon Instant Video just as elegantly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to get: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch chief Shir said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of games" and this channel does not show signs of deterioration, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
As a result of the 2004 terrorist attack, more than 330 people were killed, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked with the survivors - almost all now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the supervisor of the cemetery - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susanna Dudyeva's "Spoon"Supposed by Suzanne Dudyeva, who took part in the special operation, Ankom Employee
Having returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president on the North Caucasus and conducted negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the “B” FSB administration officer of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What struck me especially during my work on this topic is that Beslan was as if it hadn’t been for these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has at least some relation to it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan must not be forgotten, and I hope that we have coped with our task,” Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of Rambler & Co, which has been working at the company since the spring of this year.
The previous special projects were dedicated to World War I and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
DPRK launches small-range missile
North Korea has launched a small-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, Renhap reported.
The launch was made around 10:30 a.m. local time by the Chagando province on the North Korean-Chinese border.
The missile is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Japan, flying some 220 km, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee said.
MPs proposed to speed up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
In case of success of the initiative, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The State Duma introduced a draft law that provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed at the base of the legislative activity of the lower house.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Déngin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parakhin ("Just Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, in the opinion of the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more rapid and effective safeguarding of the rights of Russian citizens to the preservation of personal data and the observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which parliamentarians hasten, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, refinement and extraction of personal data of Russian citizens, in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of infringing websites - an automated information system "Register of Infringers of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the draft law were Andrey Lugova and Vadim Dengin from LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from KPRF.
Déngin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current draft law on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on the draft law introduced today in the State Duma, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own repositories of personal data of Russians in the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "in "Rostelekom", which has already been told by the owner of the company many times that they are ready to provide their servers to the Group, the company has already leased, and the company has already leased.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If companies decide to enforce the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems - they will get technological opportunities for placement," Levin said.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the bill, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that in the event of the adoption of the bill, the Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about the services of online booking of airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the draft law deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC statement stresses that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is taking place and to systematize his personal data.
In this case, it will be possible to choose the territory in which these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and significant economic losses.
The participant of the test with a bucket of ice water swollen the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so loudly when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went wrong to the pain.

A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to exercise her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The clip has become an Internet sensation and has been posted thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The soldiers handed over to the Ukrainian military more than 400 prisoners
The "Army of Novorossia" claims to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10:00 on September 1, the militias handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported by the representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that “the air force in the area of the settlement of Mereshki shot down the Su-27 plane, which violated the ceasefire agreement.”
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side in the artillery shelling of the Lugano airport used cassette ammunition prohibited by international conventions.
A spokesman for the press service noted that the militiamen were able to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian air force at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as destroy two armored carriers and two warehouses with ammunition.
"Losses in the life force of the enemy - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered in captivity," the representative of the headquarters summed up.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, armed formations of "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side as part of compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, during the night, the army of the DPR, according to the Army of Novorossia, "interrupted the attempt of the Nazi Guards in violation of the previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the area of the vicinity."
At that time, the militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a short battle, capturing six tanks and disarming 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and injured.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel was surrounded by militiamen in the Ilovaisk area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of "people's republics" to release Ukrainian military personnel from the vicinity.
The DPR agreed to do so on condition that the enemy surrendered weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semenchenko, on the night of Sunday, another 14 people came out of the "bottle".
In his Facebook post, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity with 137 regiments of the 32th division of the Russian Federation and 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense of Russia denied the reports of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the “conclusions” of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support by the Kiev authorities.
"Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unproven claims of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," the ministry said on its website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that Eurosovet, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide the conditions for a full "dialogue between the opposing parties", the ministry emphasizes.
The Ministry’s website also notes that there is currently no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, and the number of victims among the civilian population is also growing.
It should be recalled that within the next seven weeks in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the EU representatives are closely cooperating with US officials.
They are expected to correlate with each other the measures to be taken in terms of the period of action and the degree of stiffness.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy sector and the financial sector.
The Australian government has also announced an extension of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Wise Ways to Save on University Tutorials
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1000 a year, Matt Schröder, who will soon take a second course, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from senior students, offering them nominal compensation so that they defer their sale.
“My math textbook, which is usually $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schröder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, however, students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly opting for online stores and creative ideas similar to Schröder’s system.
Book rentals are becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often cost significantly less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rentals has doubled since 2011.
Research from the industry shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during last spring’s semester, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association “National Association of University Shops”.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Buying in an online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you’ll see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larsson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs around $290 per quote, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying a second-hand
If you are not against someone else’s marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casey, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a supported copy of the textbook “Strategic Solutions in the Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business.”
The book was sold for $48.
Professors, for example, Ingrid Bracey, director of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, offers students to clarify with their professors whether or not previous publications can be used.
Sometimes the updates are irrelevant for the classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Renting
About taking textbooks to rent, it is worth thinking about, if you will be well enough to deal with them, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them to yourself after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines that may be imposed on you for markings, underscores, and damages.
If you rent a book, remember: if you don’t return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The six-month rental of “Mathematical Analysis” on Chegg.com will cost about $61.
Breezy says that students studying literature can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while natural and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Holt, 29, who is going to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of a book, as this ensures that you are looking for the exact text you need.
Before ordering online, says Holt, make sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he bought was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price in the university bookstore.
Putin declares complete inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the state support of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
“15 billion rubles remained on deposits,” the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed to expedite the approval of the list of pre-development territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, did not approve the list of territories of pre-development in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, the increase of transport accessibility of the region, the removal of infrastructure constraints - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create preconditions for attracting additional investments into the region, as well as to form territories of pre-development, which should become competitive with respect to key ATP business centres, the President stressed.
It was previously reported that the territory of pre-development could replace the EEC.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn’t save cash
Sylvester Stallone’s “Indestructible 3” returned less than $30 million from his $90-million US budget, while “City of Sins: A Woman Worth Killing” returned only $12 million from his $70-million US budget.
Cameron Diaz's "Home Video" brought in just $14.6 million over the first weekend, while children's movies like "How to Handle Dragon 2" also disappoint with revenue.
The article by Telegraph critic Robbie Collins points out that when it comes to children’s films, it may be that the films themselves are of poor quality.
Collin called 2014 the “worst” year in all of history when it comes to children’s movies, and called “How to Handle a Dragon 2” a barely “functioning” fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of slightly older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily consist of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in the summer in at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day holiday in May and July 20, for 2013 and for that year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both film spectators and film critics, suggest that this year’s film yields are similar to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the issue may be in the changing viewer habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Fawro, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-released Disney film The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must acknowledge this and not try to pursue what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in Hollywood’s cash fees, Netflix’s revenue from the streaming streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost doubling last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the studios for relying too much on the comic book franchises, and predicted the “crash” of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark predictions had a share of the truth.
Due to the fact that several potential box office hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Altron, Minion and Jurassic Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in cash fees simply “cyclical,” said the Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
The product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, it prefers to replace banned imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It's better to have a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella," says Barlotti's chef Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses that suppliers offer him in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a small storage period.
Parmesan stocks should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switching to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes, which is clear: shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat was on the carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed now.
But the other day, I got a fish sample from the Far East.
So she turned out to be a brick!
I said I don't even want to talk to the person who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of the usual things for Italy for a Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must be bent to become soft, so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, where did you get such tender meat?
I said, that's your Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" on the kitchen hangs a stop-list indicating the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chef of the Brasserie Bridge and the Arrow Bar Reggie Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, and the director becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colorful cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis does it cost so much?"
They say, "We have to make money, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, you know how much weighs their armor?
At a price, it turns out to be a superdelicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "The first three months were all good, then the quality dropped sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand a stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants of European cuisine do not know what will happen to them when the stocks of cheese run out

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from poultry, meat delicacy, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurts, cabbage, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
At restaurants started a quarrel with suppliers: prices for products have increased, you urgently need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will be most strongly affected by expensive restaurants with the mono cuisine of France, Italy, Spain, in which the products were supplied directly from the "mother" countries.
The commune had to be rebuilt earlier.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers ordered beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions for the summer of 2014 were much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which bring out under the ban of Atlantic salmon and forel, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, peas and onions for babies.
The Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can still be softened.
Some of the restaurants are still in a state of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergei Mironov, a restaurant owner of Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
We only have very few such chefs, and the development of a new menu can take two or three months.
The trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to rework.
In restaurants with a mixed kitchen are already beginning to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - on beef steaks, says Sergey Mironov.
“Cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” said Oksana Glibchuk, representative of the East-West company.
Creams and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and sesame from Norway - salmon, sesame, forel from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to reconstruct than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who can distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian went there.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menus.
Replacement will take a lot of time," Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
Cafe owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones.
But there are a lot of restaurants that are almost unaffected by the sanctions.
These include establishments with the cuisine of CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Hatuna Kolbai, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the "Wai Me!" cafe.
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, on the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use.
The Colbys have not yet removed a single dish from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of restaurants "Chaihon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions are also not embarrassed: he will have to change only a lamb to a New Zealand one.
“If Russia arranges imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe,” he said.
From the CIS it is cheaper to get cuts, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what they bring from Central Asia is much better than “plastic” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are delicious, sweet.
No one is talking about Spanish.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artykov, said that he plans to increase the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by double by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fastfood restaurants, which responded to Deneg’s request, are also fairly calmly responding to sanctions.
McDonald’s said the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the department on working with suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80% of the products the network buys in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that produce from imported raw materials.
In Teremke, "sanctioned products" generally occupied no more than 4%.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the pasta "Vocker."
KFC, Burger King and Little Potatoes did not respond to Deneg’s request, but other market participants claim that Burger King’s localization rate is significantly lower than McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East fish.
On his turf
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"For products for "Grabley" prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice," - says restaurant Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of meals will increase by 5-10%, admits Colby.
East-West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have increased by 10-15% since the beginning of August.”
“Brazilian suppliers have raised prices for pork almost twice,” said Sergei Cancer, deputy director general of Stardogs.
The chickens have increased by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices," says Cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in general income for the second quarter of 2014 - just 1.8%.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it’s not clear how fast: while most restaurateurs have been stocking up on products for the next two months in the hopes of anticipating price fluctuations.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the city hall of Moscow there are dozens of tents decorated with greenery and wood.
At the center of the stage, the musicians play waltz.
It is a festival of regional products with the cheerful title "There is time there".
“We were going to make a local food holiday a long time ago, and here are the sanctions, we were flooded, organized a festival,” - says one of the organizers.
Behind the scenes with the musicians, Greek chef Anastasia prepares salad from pasta and homemade candy, in the days there was a master class on cooking borscht with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, hazelnut from Salehard, vegetables from the Moscow "Sovhoza named Lenin", cheese from the beefed Italian Jay Clouseau.
“The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East,” says owner of the fish shop “His People” Philippe Galkin.
We catch nectar, ketchup, stingray, cucumber, snail - "royal salmon".
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is an aquaculture.
You hold him in your hands, he won't even move.
And don't hold our Far East salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with the domestic mozzarella
In the showcase of his tent are shrimp with the tag "Magadan", fever, mulberry, mulberry, midia from the Crimea, combs from the Far East.
Galkin is convinced that it is a long time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, catches in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800,000 tons.
The "His people" lavka has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, and served a further one and a half dozen restaurants before the sanctions were imposed, such as "Simple things".
Currently, applications have been received from 15 other restaurants to Galkin.
The same land can be made from our fish, - it is hot.
We got cold and tried different recipes.
Now sushi is sold through the online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation at Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared a portion of Philadelphia with a ketchup.
Unlike the seven rolls, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the website of the shop "Your People" there are even rolls of coat and sea buckthorn.
In sushi bars, however, Norwegian salmon are preferred to Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are lazy to invent new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“Russian fish suppliers have not yet been offered to us,” said Dmitry Evseev, owner of Killfish Bar.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could occupy the liberated niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the project LavkaLavka Boris Akimov, now we can talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations, which have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace the forbidden imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will primarily benefit large producers of other countries," Akimov said.
However, in the past month, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass out-of-plan checks, Rospotrebnadzor temporarily suspended the activities of three McDonald’s enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg.
“We are studying the essence of the claims made to determine the actions needed to open restaurants for visitors as soon as possible,” said Money in a statement to McDonald’s.
No one really knows what's going to happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, - says the employee of the company engaged in restaurant consulting on the conditions of anonymity.
If they start shutting down McDonald’s all over the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of reference to GIBDD
Payments for the casco will be received without reference to the GIBDD - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Euro Protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive according to which from September 1 of this year to receive payments on the casco, the insured car driver will be able to do without reference to the GIBDD.
It is true, it is only about those cases when the accident was ordered under the “Euro Protocol” without the participation of the road police.
That is, if the accident involved only two cars, no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the set limit and both drivers have reached agreement on the question of who is responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the payment limit for the "Euro Protocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be ordered according to the "Euro Protocol", drivers who got into an accident, cause an accident.
After all, in the presence of a policy casco to get a refund on it without reference to the GIBDD was not possible.
The parameters stipulated in the draft guidelines are precisely intended to remove this obstacle in the way of the implementation of the “Euro Protocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payout for casco in connection with an accident, issued without the staff of the GIBDD, should not be lower than the limit under the “Euro Protocol”.
But at the same time, it can not be above the limit set in the casco insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically able to unload both the employees of the DPS and the roads.
But most likely, neither the motorists nor the insurers will be thrilled with it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules of payouts on the casco.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the exquisite Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait hours for the inspector to arrange a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
It is not yet known whether it will be easier to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the “Euro Protocol”.
The savings certificate will be made anonymous and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the presenter, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable contribution.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates on the applicant.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates on the applicant do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, as there is no need to make deductions to the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASV).
The spiciness of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken due to small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and it will affect Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ASV, control 98% of the profile market.
And the Bank of Moscow’s share, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in ASV, is that the clients of a small bank, who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his licenses try to get money in ASV.
Some investors, who do not have sufficient financial literacy and buy savings certificates on the presenter, may assume that their investments are insured.
A justified lack of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of the withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when the holders of presentation certificates tried to recover insurance reimbursement through the court," - said in the ASV.
The problem, of course, is deliberate.
After all, nobody will pay buyers of certificates anyway, because they have no right to reimbursement from the state under the law.
If the instrument was not insured in the ASW, it would also prohibit metal accounts on which citizens ' funds are accounted for in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but on their existence so far no one is trying.
The most likely thing is that the certificates on the presenter are a very convenient security that can actually play the role of quasi-denominated.
At the same time, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and before such a certificate can be issued, many owners can change it.
It is no coincidence that the draft law stipulates that a savings certificate must necessarily be a nominal securities, which must be stored in the depositary.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, the analogy of the irrevocable deposit is introduced, which bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Protests were held over the weekend by those who spoke out against the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-Semitic summit.
Stephen Farklau followed the developments over the weekend and spoke with protesters who came from all over the world: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, according to the 31 August ITAR-TASS, citing a decision taken after the meeting of the representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile complexes "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On September 1, Ms. Merkel will speak in the Bundestag with a government statement on the subject.
To date, Germany has not delivered its weapons to "hot spots".
The views of the residents of Germany on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop Islamic State fighters, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militants raid Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militiamen have seized a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, reports 31 August ITAR-TASS.
According to available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shelling of two boats of the coast guard.
The incident was reported to have occurred at around 4:20 p.m.
Teenagers picked up by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage bushookers were transported by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was dispatched, which included local police and rescue teams, and the couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Valley Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and smashed his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on the swing on Monday morning.
They were transported to Blue Mountains Hospital by an ambulance in stable condition.
We met with two unions.
The negotiations at the top level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were called, but created a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Even on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerated by delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed for the first time a number of "hot problems".
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the creams from this summit.
The questions on this account fell on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other Eurasians with Europeans saw in the telenovelas of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader gave an example of polite politeness, it was the behavior of a man who just smashed the jackpot - and plans a dignified old age in the upper society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk immediately of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimation of the president with a 20-year internship.
It is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Meliantsov, senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, is confident that from now on, Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko's aunt gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the breakthrough began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - the summer of 2013.
“Results have been achieved with the EU – these are successful negotiations on visa simplification and readmission, dialogues on modernization, – lists the interlocutor “Fire”, – and with the United States were held negotiations on international security.
The U.S. has even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction to them by the leadership of Belarus have only inflated this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, a Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea’s accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all rigour, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the OPCW, and in Baranovichi there is a Russian air base.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue – and assessed it, Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful Lukashenko’s movement towards political diversification will be, will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to meet in the EU<0x2B>TS format.
In the press service of the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was not able to quickly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in a new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosyanchic only stated to the Fire that, in the light of the resolution of the issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of first persons in the new format could be Kazakhstan.
The catch for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he, it turns out, was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union.
However, in the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made clear: all parties do not mind that Minsk remains a central platform for meetings both in the format of Russia--OASE--Ukraine, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that Europe’s “last dictator” is gaining the status of a fully-fledged European leader who helps solve the global problem.
The best friend of a European farmer
Already the composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main hurdle of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the agenda of the meeting for future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the concerns of the TC countries under the agreement on the association of Ukraine with the EU seems to be a more comprehensive achievement than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Güht, however, pointed out that EU representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not vice versa."
It seems, however, that in the economy, the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the reciprocal sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which itself is experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for the maneuver.
According to the head of the Research Center of Mises, former candidate for president of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the opportunities of Belarus to deliver agricultural products to the Russian Federation in order to bypass sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being proposed, for which Vladimir Putin rushed Minsk at the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies,” Romanchuk said.
They have long worked out supply schemes for goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
The Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not far from setting up production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw materials also with an orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very in-demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for EU and TS negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the sanctions of Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarusian president may offer Brussels to work together to minimise the impact on European farmers.
This could lift Lukashenko’s authority in the EU to an unprecedented level.
Hospitality without initiative.
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TS <0x2B> EU format is debunked, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague emphasized that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any hesitation to discuss, not from the bay-baracha to make a decision, after the signing of the Treaty on Association with the EU, to understand the situation that was taking place in Ukraine at the time," he said in front of cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against Minsk’s mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office, it is painstakingly emphasized that Belarus does not pursue useful goals in the organization of EU-TC interactions on its territory, and the ultimate goal of this format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, promotes and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," said the "Fighter" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, the ministry, where in recent times has hidden.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The government of Moscow is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating the overload of central roads in analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the mayor of Moscow on transport issues Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, we will look at all the disadvantages and advantages.
To say that some decisions have been made on this subject until early," - said Liksutov.
Zammara stressed that for the authorities of the capital, the experience of Asian cities, which in structure and density are similar to Moscow, is very important.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already feasible construction of a central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there were enough traffic infrastructure, then there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," the mayor said.
Maksim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking lots significantly dismantled the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin participated in the ceremony of laying the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Skunk is a sin
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez “The City of Sins 2: The Woman for whom it is worth killing” did not make the revolution that could be expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary night.
Sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the chain fundamental to modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if we understand the universe of the noura by the thesis, and the cosmos of the comics by the antithesis).
From now on it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"The City of Sins 2" is chaotic both at a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, here, the terrible Marv (Micky Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only and manages to take out - as such a folk companion - from the air knives and so on.
But the old people are literally squeezed by the elbows of the newcomers, as if they had broken into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, her story, shamelessly torn by the authors in the most interesting place, by the super-successful player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is with the handsome, frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something revengeful to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let’s say, does not distinguish the face from Johnny – especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters suffer with unrelenting regularity, is not trouble or even half-life.
These are not people, but we understand that they are archetypes of the noir: a year-old bitch, too confident a player, a sex detective in the "honey trap", a corrupt sound-senator.
Well, when an archetype rolls with an archetype and chases an archetype, it's not a movie anymore, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just funny.
And even in this miserable world, there is something constant.
Fighting whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense from the siege of their homeland's dark forces.
Yes, and Detective Hartigan's ghost is no-no, and he'll look at the fire, and it's always nice to look at Bruce Willis.
The main problem of “City of Sins 2” is in another.
Frank Miller was good at combining comics and novels as a talented painter, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to transfer comics to a screen.
Comics and Noir are two aggressively opposite “realities”.
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time when the novels of Dashil Hammet's "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Maltese snail" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of the noura, which was then called "hard-boiled school".
Or Pulp Fiction.
The comics have gifted Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from a sailor, Poppy - a spinach eater, giving him a rich power, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy's sister-in-law to Halk, Thor, Spider-Man, and other "vengeants."
But in any movie on the basis of the comics was something detrimental: the drawn characters persistently did not want to grow up with a screen flesh, remained pretenders in the surrounding of their will-nevel "real" world.
Simply put, they were purely devoid of “existence.”
Noar, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What Forsites, such as Tibo and Rougon-Maccara, and even the Bolkon and Rostovs, are conceivable after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera format, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet on his skin learned what it was like to work as a sanitary worker on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the party and columns of the genre such as writers Horace McCain and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lowes, Edward Dmitry.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, crude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is hardly an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable in that it was unnatural, but organically combined the comic with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic revived, not shy of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the sold-out world, where the cardinal ordered murder, and the senator covered a monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And the picturesque details like the cut heads, with which the sadist decorated his nest, the feathers of the genius James Allroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseous - representative of the neonear.
"The City of Sins 2" is not even a resignation, but a capitulation of Miller's radical stylistics - Rodriguez before the comics tradition.
It’s probably because of 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside of which the snow sleeps a toy clown.
However, most often it is not snow, but blood stains, but in a big way, what difference?
Well, about socialism and nothing to talk about.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes have, let alone on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can bring back a girl on a curved path or, say, tell uncomfortable parents that her lipstick.
When there is no place for sin in the city except sin, sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
It's boring, like any norm.
Chaos "City of Sins 2" is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic renter gave this fresh sin a small but parsley.
The titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
With regard to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man is smashed with his fingers, it gives him hellish humor.
Hamlet would have liked it.
France’s Socialists Must “Shut Up and Put France in Order,” Says Key Ally Frasois Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to “demonstrate a warm attitude” to the attacking socialist president, whose relocations have not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the inflaming conflict of the proposal, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of economy.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “unified” with the government.
However, Christian Tobir, the minister of justice, put the sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting MPs from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French “to lose faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among the socialists, saying she had no idea that the new Wallachian government would last for several months.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is the naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to assemble a new government when the previous summer did not last.
“Neither will the new one last autumn nor winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call to dissolve parliament, saying she is confident that the party can easily win early elections and is ready to govern.
France’s ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions by the end of Mr Holland’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Sienne-Poe, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but the public needs to feel quickly that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
“Drug-free city” has been left without a lawsuit
Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the lawsuit of the managing directorate of the regional ministry for the management of state property to the fund "City without drugs".
The agency intended to collect from the organization more than 7 million rubles. as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitral tribunal of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders - the Mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, which is why a decision was made to refuse the hearing.
The reason for the absence of a representative in the IUGISO Directorate could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
The Fund’s representatives were also not contacted.
We will remind, we are talking about a mansion, which occupied the fund in the center of the city on Belinsky street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the unencumbered contract of free use as the premises of the mansion-monument.
According to the IUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not contain any substantial terms and conditions for the rental of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Court of Arbitration rejected the suit, then an appeal was filed to the 17th Court of Arbitration of Perm, which was satisfied.
Then, in the same court, the fund filed a cassation appeal against this decision, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the fund in the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court took the side of the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, under which the fund began to pay the rent again, said the mayor of the city Evgeny Roizman.
The rent was assigned 300,000 rubles per month.
The previous administration of the region handed over this building to us for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
“The current administration has decided differently,” he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg Unoross Alexander Kosintsev offered the mayor - the speaker of the pride Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of murder of the retired deputy of the proud Oleg Kinev, who is considered a companion of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman Found a Criminal Case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "blame" (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatova, Director General of the Legal Center "Protection" addressed the relevant statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that “this is another attempt to avenge the truth.”
The iPhone is turned into a wallet.
In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, the press are showing new leaks about what can be expected from the presentation.
U.S. media reports that the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of a joint project by Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized online resource Re/code, at the presentation of the new products on September 9, Apple can, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet feature.
The companies themselves refuse to make any comments on the matter.
This feature allows you to make payment at the store’s cashier using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be equipped with NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows to make contactless payments using a smartphone and the corresponding reading device at the cashier.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote the technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still careful about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their equipment.
That’s why observers now hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still make retailers accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.
France's Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on deliveries to Russia "Mistrale" does not change
The official representative of the Foreign Ministry of France, Roman Nadal, said on the unchanged position of Paris regarding the supply of Russia helicopters of the type "Mistral".
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde newspaper on August 20: "Today the level of sanctions does not impede delivery.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not France," Mr. Nadal told RIA Novosti.
Thus, a representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Norwegian Cruise Approaches $3 Billion Deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market-valued company, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.L.N.) and CorniP.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise’s shares.
The sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations were not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruises, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean basin.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 percent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 percent higher than a year earlier.

The companies are keen to position themselves as cruise operators that are preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the initial public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company’s main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment conglomerate and casino controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Coke Tea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was transformed into a public company in January 2013.
Genting held a 28 percent stake, Apollo held a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company, according to data as of the end of June, according to the report.

Activists of Hong Kong’s Democratic Movement disrupt Chinese representative’s speech the day after election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People’s Representatives on Sunday set out the procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the election of Hong Kong’s leader in 2017.
All candidates must first get the support of the majority of the nominee committee, which is likely to be filled with Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot and has forced the activists of the democratic movement to again promise to stop Hong Kong’s financial center with the “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong in June, activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city’s business center and set up a meeting.
Briefing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People’s Representatives Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Bureau of Affairs and Macao State Council Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would gather at the Hong Kong head of government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said on Sunday that it had seized the territory and ordered the military to establish an administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza sector, Saiba Arikat, the global public should call on Israel to be held accountable for “continuing settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.”
Putin urges Kiev to start negotiations on the “state” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state” of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to suggest that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated and given to the Russian-speaking region.
However, Putin’s call to the Kyiv government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponded to the obvious strategy that he followed from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists not to take the territory, to force the Ukrainian government to give.
In an interview with the state-run First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently named the occupied territories New Russia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in the separatist-held regions of Ilyuki.
“We must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, to reflect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to soothe fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights were in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin press secretary’s intervention to correct Putin’s “misinterpretation” of the words underscored the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist insurgency in the east in a different way than the ethnically-open takeover of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million.
Moscow would have to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, since the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to stay inside.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to define trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, giving the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would unite the main territory of Russia.
On the Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea there are also mines, factories and casting plants, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian legislators after the new elections weigh amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions to give more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armaments and incitement are blamed for Moscow.
Putin’s latest call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders, as well as with equals, followed the new insurgents’ attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack that Ukrainian security officials say is feared to be the start of a campaign to capture strategic coastal territory up to Crimea itself.
This entailed large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsky and the narrow passageway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko appealed to a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching a point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for drafting more stringent sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the Ukrainian rebels in the security situation of the Sbronn rebels, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, press secretary.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who are reportedly detained in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airstrikes captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said in a statement.
Nude photos scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of public photos depicting nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet as a result of a large-scale hacking scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this, has about 60 frank photos of the star of "Hunger Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Apton and Kara Delevingne, singers Ryanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle and actress Kiss.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhovski and Melbourne resident Greco were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of an iCloud leak.
In the list of 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who made a Greek offer last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greek, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacking attack was "shameful" and that those to whom it was directed "feel that they were invaded."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by a nude chest pool.
Palmer's work in the film includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" Strakhovsky and the actress from "Forbidden Admission" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ, “It’s a sudden invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his displeasure to the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Playing photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different from selling stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of nude celebrities has been discovered
Mass hacking of star accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario for the development of events was described by the resource The Next Web.
A Python script was published on Github, which allowed you to select passwords for Apple’s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same link of login and Apple ID is used as for access to the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script enabled the password from Find My Phone to be recognized by the override method.
With this method, all sorts of combinations of characters are entered consistently, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service the number of passwords to enter is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and inform the user of the attempted hack.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about trying to pick up a password for their account.
The hackers recognized the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a hackapp user’s Twitter message, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago on Saturday, and it was written with a scripting program for selecting passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted Hackapp user and he noted that the aforementioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the "star" account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared foreign records.
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious actions using this service before.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded redemption from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's tweet was also hacked in the past.
If the attackers had access to iCloud as described above, the password to the head of government account in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web resource failed to get comments from Apple about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin grants Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-member
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Buryak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.

SKR discontinues investigation into the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (SCR) has terminated the criminal case for the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the airline Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the disaster was the increased rate of action on boarding, the failure of the crew of standard procedures on boarding, as well as the unintentional exit of the engines to the increased speed of direct traction.
The Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings, followed by the flight Prague-Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 during a landing at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The aircraft rolled over the runway and set on fire.
At the scene of the incident, the commander of the aircraft, a second pilot and a flight engineer were killed.
Two pilots were taken to medical facilities, where they later died from the injuries they received.
Three other pilots, who were hospitalized with severe bodily injuries, underwent long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, which was driven at the time of the accident on the Kyiv highway, suffered serious bodily injury.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the accident, the D.A. carried out a check at the Red Wings, during which numerous violations were detected.
In February 2013, the airline’s license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.

Anger proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of man
The expression of a face is biologically universal to humanity, and each organ and group of muscles involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists in Australia and the United States have found.
They told about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly read about them in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - tilted and lowered down the eyebrows, stretched in a thin line of the lips, swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from birth to children who have never seen it, notes lead author of the study Aaron.
As part of a major research project dedicated to the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has arisen for the effective conduct of disputes during a conflict.
The more physical harm one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he reports it to the interlocutor through anger.
Researchers have found evidence and another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and go to court, consider themselves entitled to impose on others unfavourable conditions, and also prefer force-based conflict resolution methods to peaceful ones.
Refusing from the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining,” the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous than the contemporaneous person to agree with the conditions in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thus make it possible to do so.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled on the computer a person, where each of the seven elements of the angry person were present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or the protruding chin separately did not make the face bad, the person depicted with such traits was recognized by the participants of the study unanimously.
Man’s anger, as with animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own strength, forcing one to accept and obey.
A person inflates the nostrils and presses the lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that demonstrates its claws.
Anger is triggered by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, as effectively as possible demonstrating the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tubi.
