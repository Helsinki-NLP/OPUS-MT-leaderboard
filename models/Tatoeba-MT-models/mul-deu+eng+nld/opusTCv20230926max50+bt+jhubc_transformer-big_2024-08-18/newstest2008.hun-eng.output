Europe’s food prices have been declining.
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The November price increase was higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, with annual inflation of 3.1% after 2.6 percent in October, the EU's statistical office said.
The official forecast is only 3% probable, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, did not cut the base rate, saying the reduction would lead to the formation of an inflationary spiral along with rising commodity prices and mitigating unemployment.
The ECB is below 2 percent, but wants to keep the inflation rate close to it.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the trap of twenty-two: "we need to talk about" inflation so that it does not have to act on this topic later.
In Germany, November’s inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a 12-year record, while in Spain it rose from 4.1 to 3.6.
Inflation in the eurozone has been pushed to a high level by rising food and energy prices.
Deadlines for wheat have risen by 88 per cent, and soybean prices have reached their highest value since 1973.
Ethanol and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price of petroleum rose by 52 percent this year, and last month it was worth almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will drop from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it will already fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will remain at around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support has grown significantly in early December, making it the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such a low socialist support rate of 13 percent.
The difference in the Commissioner's party voters - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support against the MSZP's one-fifth (20 percent) support.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their total support within the population is 2%.
Among the commissary voting party voters, there are more than one percent supporters of both camps.
The economic mood has further deteriorated to the previous low – there has never been such a high rate of 41 percent of those who specifically considered the country’s economic situation to be very bad, while another 46 percent say the situation is quite bad.
Families are now again more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation after the hopeful prospects of spring and summer.
For the next year, the larger half of the population expects further deterioration and only a dozen improvements.
In December, more than any previous Gallup survey, 71 percent of those surveyed thought the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than doing his job well.
In Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny Ferenc, 13 percent of respondents trust or very trust, while in Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, 38 percent are supporters.
Fidesz’s head of government is 54% untrustworthy, while Fidesz’s president is 27% untrustworthy.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be managed without a change of government.
While 35 per cent of the government and the head of government have said it is desirable to remain in office after the October riots, so far this rate is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees only the solution in the new elections.
Typical of the interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of respondents answer a question that detracts from the intent to participate, saying they are sure to leave, and another 20 percent say they are likely to leave.
By comparison, only 55 per cent would take part in a "now Sunday's parliamentary election" and another 15 per cent would consider their participation probable. The result of the referendum would not be questionable based on the present intentions.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 to visit fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital daily fees.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who promised to take part in the referendum, then 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would decline the introduction of tuition, visiting fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive is Auchan, with almost one-fifth the Tesco
In the Bodaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that VAT did not rise this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
This year, the average annual Christmas basket in the trade triangle in Bodaörsi grew by 16 percent, but in each of the hypermarkets there was an increase in the value of more than 1000 forints.
Since in December last year, prices in food stores have already "stirred", so there has been no more drastic price increase compared to the previous high base.
But it’s obviously scary for consumers that what they could get for well under nine thousand forints last year, they don’t even get to it for ten thousand.
The Daily basket in the hypermarkets examined at least 91 forints crossed the threshold of ten thousand forints.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(in 2003, the basket cost 6800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the poultry camel fillet, nuts and macaques were also very expensive.
The KSH tracked the prices of flour and bread in the shops, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 HUF.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-liter removable bottle of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, so the deposit fee included only 257 forints for the product.
However, this year, Auchan proved to be the most expensive in the Daily Basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, the Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Daily Basket by about 18-18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and this year’s cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive was 21 percent growth.
The average growth in Forint was 1480.
Last year the average price increase came out to 1206 HUF, so last Christmas felt the impact of the price increase in VAT.
It was this process that swirled the trade, apparently the stores could not decide how much pricing they would apply to a single product, because they were unable to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the speed of a product is poorly planned by the trader, it can make a serious profit at the price adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
The increase in the price of the Daily Basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive was HUF 1,720 more than the value in 2006, while the cheapest was only HUF 844.
This year, this extreme was not shown, as the most expensive one today was more than last year at HUF 1630, and the cheapest one was more expensive at HUF 1284.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets more than 30 percent more expensive in less than 20 months.
(By the way, this does not necessarily justify the KSH data: the Statistical Office has increased the price of some basic foods by more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
In addition to the flour, for example, the eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price of the rather expensive product already last year produced a price increase of just over 10 percent compared to the base in the worst case.
According to the signs, the flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the eggshells, and the drastic increase in prices has been able to beat the multiplier.
In the trading gold triangle, hypers don’t complain, they constantly report a good year.
According to our experience, in the three shops visited, the bulk of customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantity from everything, they take durable foods in a plateau.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores had serious rows in front of the cash registers, as the number of visitors suddenly increased.
But we know that in rural areas, more and more people are complaining to the research firms that even their plans are missing out on revenue, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Save on disinfectants in many places
This year, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, which have developed mainly due to the improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff are not conducive to stopping infections, says the head of the department of the National Epidemiology Center.
It is also used in many places on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatological department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
A man who was admitted to the hospital after a serious accident was shown to be resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was separated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of the year.
He was discharged from the hospital in a serious car accident, but soon after he had to return with MRSA infection, and has not been able to perform an important operation since then due to the bacteria in his body.
This year, up to December 10, 1094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Böröcz Karolina, chief class physician at the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, others are unknown.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, which is Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is carried by one-third of people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured well.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or incorrectly, a bacteria that reacts well to antibiotics develops a very resistant bacteria against antibiotics, which spreads rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
First of all, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently malfunctioning, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis - in patients with the most impaired body, the elderly or low body weight.
According to the director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the carriage, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"We separate such patients, the nursing staff provides the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients who enter the hospital are initially examined for the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
It's not fashion for sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions do not favour the prevention of the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Böröcz Karolina.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals, nursing homes, hospitals should monitor the patients who are recovering, and patients carrying MRSA should be isolated immediately.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most cases are thus brought to light when the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief of the department at the epidemiological center.
The European Union has stringent recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections and diseases.
It should be sought to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out so that resistance to drugs does not develop, but hospitals do not adhere to this in all cases.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in pathological and basic care, said Böröcz Karolina.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is most often spread from one patient to another through the mediation of health care personnel.
Therefore, the use of handwashing, gloves and masks plays a very important role, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
With MRSA infection, it spreads through contact, but in domestic hospital conditions, it is not always possible to separate the infected patient.
In addition, the hospital rooms are often crowded, often very close to the beds, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, it is also perceptible, noted Böröcz Karolina, that hospitals in an unfavourable financial situation save on disinfectants, there is little caregiver, many patients, so there is an even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are followed, there is less evidence of such an infection, or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is causing huge expenses for health insurers, which is why they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included the prevention or reduction of MRSA.
According to the signs, the program is successful, based on the reported data, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
Among the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) is the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
He was not drunk by the police captain who caused the fatal accident.
The official expert opinion has been drawn up on the fatal accident caused by the 22nd District Police Captain.
It is not possible that he had been led in a drunken or depressed state by a police captain of the XXIIth district, who had gassed a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General’s Office of the City, on Friday after the
The expert opinion supported the primary investigation result, which already found that the former police captain did not drink alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
The then captain of the XXIIth District Captaincy, with his own passenger car, struck a 55-year-old man in front of him on a turn in the street of Kossuth Lajos, XXII District, on Tuesday, who did not want to cross the designated pedestrian crossing to the overpass of the road.
(The latter, that is, that the pedestrian does not cross the zebra, according to the rules of the KRESZ is otherwise not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car should still give priority.)
The infantryman died after being taken to the hospital.
Due to the incident, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked for him to be put in custody, police said, because the incident was so shocking.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Morvai Attila also pointed out that the former police captain cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the start.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million on education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as on a credit framework to support energy.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the Hungarian budget funding of transport and environmental projects from the Cohesion Basic Support in 2006, of which the amount of EUR 100 million will amount to EUR 200 million in the form of a loan agreement already signed by the parties.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement also serves as budget funding for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this purpose for Hungary, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million could be used later by extending the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties have signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract, which is mainly used for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
Subway No. 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes details of the financing of the subway with the EU, they will return to whether and how to amend the original contract.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this will take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded 113 projects in Hungary with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans shall be paid by the EIB with a maturity of 8 years and without any maintenance fee.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the whole of Europe's attention is focused on the Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where and who buys the EU in a market that is still the cheapest but quickly priced?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The most popular Eastern European property purchase destination is now without a doubt Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beachfront houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sunshore", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more people are looking for property in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later the central part of the country will also raise the interest of investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more are also buying in the already inexpensive area of Russia.
The capital, Sofia, also boasts attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces that promise the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of Europe’s most attractive golf paradises, making it a top destination in the summer and winter seasons as well as the other two seasons.
Foreseeable investors are therefore already buying large quantities, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski paradises.
Foreign buyers can be classified into three groups – says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers either buy or renovate properties for between 50 and 100,000 euros, or demolished old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a metropolis, shops and generally the proximity of a local doctor.
The second category is for holiday shoppers (Bulgaria was included in the list of the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business-oriented investors who buy in the hope of a medium or long-term increase in value.
The price of real estate in the capital is constant as the demand is growing.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but they have increased by 21 per cent year-on-year in the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices substantially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Affairs, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor will conclude the expert meetings on Tuesday, and after the official opening on Wednesday, the negotiations of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are negotiating the Bali Roadmap, which includes efforts following the emission reduction period designated by the Kyoto Protocol to 2012.
There is currently a fierce debate between developing and developed countries about this.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently want to negotiate accurate figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 state.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will undertake, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries in need.
An agreement has also been reached on the grants to developing countries.
The fund, which is under the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, expected within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - read in the Market and Profit.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Affairs G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to the level of 1990, regardless of whether they have agreed to comply with the "post-2012 agreement" and whether they have agreed to do so in the future, and are ready to do so by up to 30%.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the total acceding countries to the Kyoto Protocol set a target of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, including the EU - 15 more Member States - committed a reduction of minus 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, which our country will meet. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes in Bali are high, because within two years the international climate policy agreement will have to be brought under the umbrella of a long-term agreement, otherwise its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case, there will be no further reductions under the Kyoto Protocol, no further reductions under the Kyoto Protocol.
This would result in a delay in emissions reduction and would inevitably result in an increase in the Earth’s average temperature above 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
A British Army is recruiting on YouTube
Recordings of the Iraqi and Afghan actions will be posted on the video-sharing site by units of the British military, with which they promote themselves.
For the first time, the British Air Force (RAF) got it on YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature footage with a helmet-mounted camera is checked by the Air Force’s Kandahar Operation Commander and then sent to London, where the locals upload it to the Internet.
The Inevitable Political Message
Air Force soldiers have already made 139 recordings in this form on the Internet, and their "channels" have been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007, and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan actions, while the British Ministry of the International Community (Commonwealth Office) and its Youtube international peacekeeping units (FIM).
Invasion in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force’s original intention, it made the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to make known to the general public the real purpose of the army’s foreign presence.
The propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional TV recruiting advertisements, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but it also carries some political message inadvertently, as the government in a peculiar form confirms the death penalty.
The U.S. made a game
The army is also troubled by the fact that in addition to carefully edited, censored footage, amateur videos are uploaded to the divider, which, for example, show the deaths of soldiers: they speak of the little bloody, "official" propaganda films, because they are the highest-ranking ones.
By the way, many videos of the Iraqi and Afghan battlefields have already been released on the Internet, which were made with sharp intrusions, but the British army has only recently received it.
Americans are recruiting a little differently, with a free downloadable shooter game called America's Army, in which the player can hide directly into the soldiers' skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Tombstones and Poachings will be Christmas at the Ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem emotional: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold an annual working meeting for her employees, who will be able to thank her for her pagan and coffee from 2007.
Akad is a ministry where there will be a live music party, elsewhere, with a touch and a cuddle, the Christmas mood is enchanted in the heart of the officials.
Buli, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you can have fun with power.
Government agencies are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest Christmas party of the Ministry is held by the National Defence Fund this year, but HM does not expect the employees of the Ministry.
On Christmas Day, the children of the fallen soldiers receive a gift, on Mission Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited, but they also hold a press conference.
The budget is $25 million for the mood at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be fired compared to the other portfolios.
GKM’s party is held in the House of the Future, out of a total of 4,320,000 forints, and around three hundred and fifty guests from the six hundred ministries are expected.
They will insist on the Christmas spirit at the celebration of the purse, but there will be performances and a lot of buttons.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was held in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) on Wednesday - there were also concerts and dinners.
The room beer cost HUF 1 million, and the remaining part was spent on more than four hundred invitations.
We know that one of the NFÜ’s departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is arranged by an application management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU funds.
For this purpose, the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>th<0xC3><0xA1>z was rented.
The information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt, as we were unable to reach the competition.
You don't need a suit
The building of the ILO not only saw the NFÜ as a guest, but also the Ministry of Justice and Order, which held the Luca-Day Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
They did not ask for money for the use of the ILO premises.
Five hundred people took part in the ball.
The party started with the welcome of the minister, and after dinner it was possible to dance to live music.
On the question of the [origo], it was announced that the ballet was not mandatory at all for the evening dress or the suit.
Puritan party is organized by the Health, Labour and Local Government Funds.
The Ministry of Health organizes a show and a celebration for the workers in their own building for HUF 400,000.
Lamperth M<0xC3><0xB3>nika, the Minister of Labour, is not officially waiting for a Christmas party, but for a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to receive, the press department said, only coffee and peanut butter, so the party will be brought out of HUF 350,000.
Bajna’s municipal minister Gordon, however, will simply co-chair with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, with 436 employees expected to attend.
For each guest 2500 HUF for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet reception and a cocktail party.
Since Veres J<0xC3><0xA1>nos is the minister, PM employees have been celebrating the same Christmas every year.
There will be no bullying, however, and not only the minister’s speech, but also the afternoon time will strengthen the official position.
The agricultural portfolio will give a New Year's Eve reception on January 20, and the Ministry's Christmas will be missed.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyadvar, the City Hall, and according to the publication of the portfolio, 1000 forints per person will be given to the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple admission, for which only foreign graduates accredited to Hungary are official.
These receptions, held each year, begin with a short ministerial greeting and end with a restrained smear.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture, the [origo] said in the relevant press departments.
The price of the official Christmas of the Environmental Protection Fund could not be reported to the press department.
More than four hundred people were invited to attend the festival, which will be held at the Museum of Industrial Artists.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering.
On Friday, the National Association of Trade Unions and Workers’ Councils will form a strike committee coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
They will hold a protest rally on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the cessation of employment will begin.
The action will certainly cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop, and the BKV will be on strike for 13 hours as well.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will announce the details of Monday’s strike organized jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
The protesters will hold a general meeting on Saturday, and from Monday onwards, the organizations joining the strike will cease work indefinitely if they are unable to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike that has begun has not been set - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance act.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
But if the legislation is voted on, then the strike committees will meet and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted only in the late evening, or possibly at night.
Due to the strike that began on Monday, significant increases in transport can be expected: work at the railway is suspended indefinitely, in the morning some of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies, may stop.
At the same time, there will be road closures in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations joined the strike call, and the list of these is constantly updated in the League tomorrow.
Some organizations have reported a strike indefinitely, while others have announced a temporary cessation of employment.
Until Thursday afternoon, the M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Association of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, and with the Christmas holidays approaching, more and more people travel on the railway.
According to the previous announcements, from the start of the plant to 13 hours strike at the BKV, at Budapest Airport between 7 am and 9 am, a four-hour strike is held by the LIGA Electrical and Thermal Industry Associations, and 2 and 2-8 hours of the Pegud<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>ds Szg<0xC3><0xB3>dédööök Szöök<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>dek<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC3><0xB3>
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationally, at different times, and the SZEF’s Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) holds a two-hour warning strike.
The four demands made by the League are most important for the government to withdraw its proposal for health insurance reform and forge a new concept for the social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce a new method of calculating pensions due from next year.
The third is to ensure that pensioners with old-age pensions have access to the system even before 2010 for workers who deserve it.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Association of Railway Workers of the League of Trade Unions (VDSZSZ) does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for the railway wing lines, another offer awaits.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the country’s risk
With the support of Jobbik Movement for Hungary, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year, raised the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
In the company's "risk warning" it was written: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that the "possibility of evaluating the ethnic tensions between the gypsies and non-gypsies in Hungary may, by the way, be short-lived".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an act - added the research institute.
As they wrote, all this is due to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: "the public debate on the Roma issue was handed over to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy against this gypsies."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, under the influence of the great domestic and international media surveillance, "significantly spoiled the image of Hungary created abroad, especially in terms of the stability of the country and the belief in the democratic development of the country".
It is recalled that the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, which has gained increasing publicity and momentum since the fall of 2006, is part of the reorganization of more self-defense organizations called "national self-defense" in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
"The common feature of these consolidations is that they define themselves as a civil organization, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members - whether armed - for defensive tasks (catastrophe protection, national defense, police protection), in addition to the duty of the police, the army, or the state."
It was noted that all this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the political and impartiality of society, seeks to put different political aspirations into civilian clothing.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association is therefore not only used to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration in these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-intensive factor in terms of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, several neighbouring states have also referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger, and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to prove their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks for the whole region have increased.
As it has been written, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union on the far right (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard are the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the districts of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
The BNU took advantage of this decision to set up the Guard, saying that the organization was aimed at "national self-defense".
For the past 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced “gypsy terror”, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to the Political Capital.
It added: the initiative sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, the increased risk of ethnic clashes indicates that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they are setting up their own guard as resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma react in the same way by organising their own self-defense to the threat.
Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz Attila, director of research at Political Capital, told the televised office that risk analysis was one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis every year, and if they experience one that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
It’s not always a red letter.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and the reorganization of the working day around the holidays has become a general practice, which will be less for next year.
In the US and the EU, the holiday is not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between a national and a state holiday and a working day.
Working days are usually linked to ecclesiastical holidays and significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the year and the first day of the new - the latter only so that the New Year's guests can relax.
There are a total of 11 red-letter festivals throughout the year.
The National Day commemorates the Revolution of 1848, the 15th of March and the 23rd of October, the anniversary of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, we celebrate the work, and on November 1 and 2, we remember our relatives, our friends.
In addition, there is a two-day celebration of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to relocate the working day in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that on the preceding Saturdays we don’t stay away from work-school.
That the day immediately before or after the holiday should be worked out exactly when, for many years, the Minister of Labour has been regulated by a separate regulation.
The law shall apply to all employers and to the employees employed by them, to public servants and to those who are in a public service relationship.
However, the uninterrupted operation and the purpose of the operation shall not affect the service providers or institutions operating even on working days.
This year, only the holidays at the end of the year are changing: from December 24, life will almost stop in the country, because according to experience, the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slide" by the majority of people, or use their saved freedom for this purpose.
There will be more holidays in the middle of the week and at the end of next year, so there will be less workday shifts than this year.
First, the work holiday is transformed around the calendar, so that the workers can stay at home for four days at the same time.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, in exchange for Friday, May 2, a day off.
The other relocation is related to the holiday of October 23: on October 18, it will have to work on Saturday instead of the 24th on Friday.
The end of the year, however, can definitely take place next year, as from December 24, almost everywhere there is a non-stop break, even if New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six terrifying little things that can make you angry with your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemail messages that we never get, innocent lies that we hardly ever notice: they “colorize” the everyday at work.
It’s a question of whether you’re getting used to the minor inconveniences or taking on the glove and consciously avoiding misunderstood situations that cause resentment to others.
A tip.
“Sorry, I forgot to mention that they were looking for the marketing class,” one of your colleagues said.
That's why you missed a meeting?
At best, you’ll regret it and try to make it right, maybe call the marketing department to tell you that you’ve forgotten to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's handled with an apology.
Before you get a embarrassing discharge, it’s worth thinking about what it’s like to get unpleasant minutes for your colleagues, and consciously try to avoid it.
You're borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching a piece of paper, office supplies, or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Do you remember putting your fireworks on the table yesterday, but it got wet in the morning?
Do you ever uncover a pencil that you thought was lost on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking for it, because they’ll be rightly angry at you for harassing their property.
Don’t put it in your pocket from office envelopes, post-it, because it can be uncomfortable if it’s gone ahead of time and you need it right away.
Do you care about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumor that is spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t put your understandings (presumptions) on the privacy of your colleagues on everyone’s nose!
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, don't live back with his confidence.
Bury what you have heard in yourself, and don’t negotiate with your colleagues in the absence, even if others know about what your colleague was wearing.
You mean an unwarranted patient?
When you call the office and report a patient referring to a swollen headache because you feel bad or you feel more at rest that day; think about doing your job, your unavoidable tasks, your scheduled work instead.
Don't fuck with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you’re not going to go into the office the next day, or something may happen that will make you stay home, signal your colleagues and boss not to face your lack the next day.
Dudling, whistling, calling
You got into the job, but you're getting a little rough out of it by the clergy?
Did you inadvertently turn into an earbud for a phone call that would have been better to not hear?
Do not confuse your coworkers with snoring, singing, loud conversation (which you carry on over their heads), or with kicking, continual embarrassment, loud discontent.
These can all be disturbing, even if they don’t really go into one project (writing, planning, organizing).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If you don’t have time for something, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, don’t blame anything else for your oblivion!
Don't refer to the chaos that may prevail in the office, your vocal counterparts!
Admit if you made a mistake, and someone else's disadvantages came from it, and eliminate the sorbet.
Ask how you can make up for your mistakes, replace the failure.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable wear for home, but not for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable clothes if your work permits.
Don’t be sloppy, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going into the office in your everyday outfit – if your workpiece demands it, chic, elegantly –!
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting
Car-riding in the usual breakfast stopper.
There is a special tune coming out of the radio: a violin with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The music has changed pace and the bass arrives next to the previous sounds, then the female choir is turned on as a real jewellery.
Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
For a long time, the musical life of the homeland did not embellish us with a good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems that the plug is quite different if you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi’s appearance, some new and exciting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, slowly change the overall picture, and in vain fashion again proves the guitar-drip garage rock, the domestic electropop: it’s new under the Sun.
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs started from Pécs and also played in the Yonderboi band, until - perhaps because he did not catch two kisses in a jar - he took his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines jazz, electronic dance, and pop elements, however, he began to break through when film soundtracks were asked to compose (e.g.
The Turkish Ferenc Season.
The formations in smaller clubs were first introduced to a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their 2002 debut album as one of the 50 most important domestic albums, and named Zagar, in the company of Yonderboi, as the market-capable t-shirt for the almost unique fashion in the west.
Without a doubt, Zagar and the band became "trend", but of course no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better record.
The now released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new avenues for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the early Pécs years.
This is because Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was one of the lines of an old band there.
We would have been on the spot with aerial reference, but in addition to the aeriality of the music, the effect of the louder guitar, rock and roll, has now emerged - according to the spirit of the age, according to the trend.
In these songs, György Ligeti, currently working with The Puzzle band in England, showed up at the album's Millennial premiere.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who played popular music from the early morning until the late evening, began smuggling into the ears with the six domestic singers (“Underground Divas”) recorded the grand melodies of Wings of Love.
It's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs.
hvg.hu: This new drummer now raises the question: how much layer music are you playing?
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>er Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs: The definition of layer music doesn’t mean much to me.
I think there are two kinds of light music casts; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can also be flat, bleak, and just as well be made for sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop can also come from an honest motive.
Your attitude to the host also works in the spirit of this, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially west of us, there are greater traditions of light music.
There not only the ten-and-twenty-year-olds attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They are much more attentive to the light changes taking place around them, because they are also considered part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more noticeable at concerts, where the effect on each other already works, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
Still, I noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting from there.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He's working in a solo studio, and he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We’re not really going his way, no matter how often they try to explain it in our music.
We are rather team players who trust in the other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us left his band and took a different route.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first on the top list of Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time.
Have you consciously opened up with the most popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit and then sell the record.
This song is about more.
We intended the finale of the album, with which we tried to solve the soundtracks and the more difficult themes on the record.
HVG.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly them - what was the command?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to compose this choir from the soundtracks of our own home music scene.
This is how the six-member chorus – Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Enik<0xC5><0x91> [Neo], Németh Juci – was formed, which we then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the song designed or shaped by the girls like this?
Zs.B.: The number was an instrumental version that had been around for a long time, and then when the record material came together, we thought we needed something else for that number.
He's got the chords to get my vocals.
That night, I sang to her the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost the first time, and it came spontaneously.
I remember being very excited at the time, but of course the D<0xC3><0xAD>v<0xC3><0xA1>k had to do it.
It wouldn't have worked so hard with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own roles, they sing together completely and they're no louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind was purely because of technical problems.
But it’s clear that we didn’t want to share solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting our ego a little bit, who came from, where it is going, just let those certain wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you have the most work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the pieces were more difficult than the process of making music, rather than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a racing song, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where she didn't want the groove to work for a long time, and then pretty slowly everything stood in its place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: That’s constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I’ve already “heard” the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitorous broker risked billions due to a sense of inferiority
It's a cold-blooded wreck.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French banker Generale Société Générale, named his employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that the not-talented Kerviel was more than just a great player who wanted to reach out to his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, it recognized the crisis of the US mortgage market on time.
"Intellectually impaired," he said from the police officers.
However, according to Le Monde, Kerviel’s testimony reveals that he made a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in the United States
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, the U.S. was able to make half a billion euros.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was news that there would be problems with the so-called subprime mortgages provided to low-income or customers with cancellation problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in this and put him on a good horse.
At the end of the year, the profit reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
"By the time I asked for the first half-billion, I didn't know how to report it," Kerviel admits, adding that he hadn't kept anything to himself.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that it could not be revealed.
He also managed to swindle his bosses, even when he began to be interested in his trades on the Eurex exchange.
Risk was a profit.
Afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
"I thought that the fact that I was making $1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them."
Where did you want to take so much risk?
Gradually he reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a broker assistant and became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of $90,000 a year.
He knew, however, that he would never make as much money as others.
“In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me badly.
"It's also because of my performance, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
It wasn’t long after his first major success.
Thanks to the Allianz's shares, he earned half a billion euros in the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And that started the lava - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know everything, or they were more likely to guess.
"While I was making money, they were blindfolded."
But there was a strike at the beginning of the year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend, she wanted to snuggle in mid-January.
When he went to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find out?
Because of his freedom, he became a suspect.
“In the past year I have only taken four days.
“The broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to be able to look into his reports,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic is likely to acquire $365 billion.
Ministers of the Czech Government, together with representatives of the European Commission, have signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) in the coming years.
The Czech Republic will be able to obtain almost the entire amount from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The seven operational programmes will cost around CZK 125 billion to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion kroner from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, goes to transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents 22 per cent of the assets acquired from the funds for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be managed by 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain tools for innovative enterprises.
Companies should also have the resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but also the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in earning money from EU funds so far, within the framework of the newly recruited countries.
Former Nicaraguan President Approves 20 Years in Jail by Court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday granted a 20-year prison sentence to Arnold Aleman, the country’s former president, who was convicted in 2003 of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion kroner) in financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will return behind bars again is unclear, according to the AP news agency.
The President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Perez, said it would depend on the prison’s leadership to allow the German sentence to be dropped at home or to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Germany that it regularly referred government funds to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers were, in reality, their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money was subsequently spent at the foundation, which was founded to finance Germany’s 2001 election campaign.
Our budget has been approved.
That's right.
The state budget has been approved.
Why is this budget so special?
This is the first budget, drawn up by this government, approved by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This year passed even with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow the rejection.
Unlike the distrust of the government before the vote, there was no drama this time, unlike the loud debate over the distrust of the government.
The House of Representatives has adopted this generally disregarded, though the most influential law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends at each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the powerful struggles of the government and the opposition.
This is more appreciated in the press, so you get a lot more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than the mere figures.
The state budgets of the past Social Democratic governments have faced three shortcomings that the 2008 budget is not able to solve at the same time:
The first of these is the high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called commission expenditures, which not only means pensions, but also social benefits, approved last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections.
The second is due to the first deficiency in the deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and towns.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This is public and is relatively under scrutiny.
Timed bombs are the budget deficits of cities and walkways.
In addition to money from taxes, taxes, and bank loans, many mayors have been able to raise money for other investments, often indefinitely issued bonds with which their townhouses were disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, it has managed to eliminate these debts by mass selling of shares in energy and other distribution networks, which were received from the state from the privatizations.
They no longer have such a source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we determine that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a phase of growth that the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting about.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to reorganize public finances.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly indebted.
The other countries, with two exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more reasonably farmed than the Czech Republic.
This is a huge embarrassment to the previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, is the least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for huge social programs, for example, which, unfortunately, have in recent years swollen into a gigantic size completely superfluously.
Although this year it has managed to eliminate the part of the absurd populist expenditures approved before the elections, even if in the near future there will not be an extension of the retirement limit and pension reform, it will only end in this country, in fact, in any political age.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the majority of the money being taxed by the governing politicians generally becomes their mechanical distribution of pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, it can only stop the reduction of normal expenditures through client spending.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be totally superfluous if previous governments hadn’t wasted everything that could have been done in the last decade.
If we don’t really want mere officials to be made out of the governing politicians, then we have to be patient and we have to wish for peace to prepare further reform laws, these not too strong, they can get out of the many coalition governments that are aware of the fact that the state gives only what it gives.
It is only these that make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the money markets.
Thus, the money markets will cost more than a hundred billion dollars through the stock market.
On this exchange, the bank raises the interest rate for which they are willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion to the stock exchange and making twenty-four more available to the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, the country’s central banks have agreed for the first time on a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should address the biggest problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend to their customers,” said Bernard Baumohl, an advisory firm at Economic Outlook Group.
“Coordinated action by central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost $60 billion primarily in the United States due to unpaid loans.
Analysts expect billions more losses.
“Central banks can really be afraid of what else could happen if they decided to follow such a procedure,” said Kieran Davies, ABN Amro’s chief executive officer.
It seems like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that even if banks themselves have a hard time accessing loans, they will also be more expensive to lend to their customers.
This would reduce the need and put the U.S. economy in recession with the possible consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks subsequently decided that the so-called LIBOR, the interbank rate of supply in London, which is used for lending on the interbank market, was not successful.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of borrowing money from each other, despite the fact that central banks in the US, Canada and the UK have also lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have a similar effect to this further interest rate cut," Greg Salvaggio, from Tempus Consulting, told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks will contribute to resolving the crisis, as it does not solve the sub-problem of the collapse of the US property market.
Klaus: The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is one of the biggest threats to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticized the UN’s international conference on climate change held in Bali.
The book Blue, not the green planet, presented in Vienna, made it clear that the debates of ecologists are unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is made up of a peculiar mixture of representatives of governments and civil organisations, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
"The debate there is absolutely lacking in structure, it's just throwing words that are supplements to solving the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that his theme is very important and that is why he is so committed to this theme.
He expressed his satisfaction over the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, since, as he said, "often I meet only the cartoons of my opinion".
Now, therefore, your interested parties can read your unsubstantiated opinion.
Klaus reminds us that while he is not a climatologist, he believes he has sufficient prerequisites for writing such a book.
Since he is able to monitor and judge professional dissertations, he is experienced as an academic in statistics and also an economist.
At the end of the book, he pointed out as the thesis that the climate is constantly changing, that is, changes are normal, and there is no equal opinion on the warming of the planet for all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and the consequences of the changes are not too serious and therefore not too serious.
In addition, as a person with experience in the field of totalitarianism, he considers the imposition of unproven opinions on others to be unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against reasonable protection of the environment, but against militaristic environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus had already spoken about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 could not exchange their licenses.
Sixty thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to replace their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last time they can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue the new licence in time by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the license has not been replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the trips represent a sharp drop in interest in the exchange of permits, the capital’s offices have been flooded with requests for the exchange of permits, for which interest has increased this week.
The Office of the Mayor receives approximately 2,000 clients a day.
It should be in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet replaced the licence.
The issuance of a new licence lasts 20 days.
However, the new licence may also be required for a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay a further five hundred crowns.
Drivers of vehicles who are unable to make the compulsory exchange of licences by the end of the year and are travelling with an invalid licence are subject to a penalty from January.
The perpetrator must pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
However, the police may also arrange the expulsion by way of an agreement.
In the event of an administrative failure, the penalty is 2,500 kroner.
Based on previous information received from the City Hall, you can also get a fine if you do not travel anywhere.
You can claim to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The ministry has previously called on the authorities to be apologising and to impose penalties of up to a thousand crowns.
However, Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, said tens of thousands of fines would not threaten anyone.
According to him, the license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not a passport that should be valid for everyone.
Those who no longer want to drive, should relinquish their license.
It is sufficient to take it or to send it by post to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually replace the other types of licences as well.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 may be replaced for a further three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will only expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court Reduces Penalty for Investigators Associated with Berdycchel
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k were former police officers who were suspected of complicity with David Berdych, and were sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague Supreme Court has decided to do so with final effect, which thus reduced the sentences for one of them, the Magistrates, by two years.
Investigators of the Organized Crime Division in Prague were initially threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
An appeal against today’s decision can no longer be appealed, a review can only be sought at the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, he is only awaiting a first-degree verdict.
In other cases, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't get any more.
In January, the County Court found 19 people guilty of robberies, of which the Supreme Court today dealt with 16 appeals.
The majority of the defendants rejected the accusations from the start of the investigation by saying it was a case of speculation.
According to the Central Czech Senate, after the agreement with Berdyc, the members of the police provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up the individual robbery attacks and helped the band to avoid attracting the offender.
Therefore, the gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>ar<0xC4><0x99>.
The indictment deals with the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
In the first place, it is about robberies whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the powers of public officials and unauthorized possession of weapons.
Since the police had illegally held pistols, steel ammunition, laser range or machine gun during the House Inquiries.
The gang is accused of seizing tens of millions of crowns with the robbery.
A gang of at least twenty members has already been found legally guilty of Berdych's other robbery and many others in the process.
Further members of Berdych's surroundings testify before the court in other proceedings, some of which have not yet been brought before the court.
The first-degree trial has so far avoided Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Put<0xC3><0xA1> and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on criminal proceedings against the Czech Republic regarding their expenditure.
Account for child-exchange: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for damaged families, is demanding a 12 million kroner from the hospital in Treb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> for the children exchanged at the maternity hospital, plus court costs.
Three million for mothers per head, two million for fathers, and one million for children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l Veleba, basically disagreed with the proposal.
"We reject such a claim because it's too much," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's hearing.
"In order for us to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
Determine if it has any usable value.
But we maintain our opinion that it will be measurable to everyone in the hundreds of thousands," said Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted a million kroner for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
With him he served as the basis for the compensation negotiations, an expert critique developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
The parents of the children, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered mental damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by the men, even if they encountered such scruples that they did not impede the exchange of the newborn.
Women are worse at coping with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and with what is happening right now, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronica and Nikolai were replaced by nurses at the <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>b<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> nursery on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their parents by blood - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kéz to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, Veronika Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, the head of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina district, handed over 100,000 crowns to the families to compensate for their expenses, which resulted from the error of the hospital in <0xC5><0xA2>reb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ské, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the mandatory health insurance according to the law.
In the event of an error, they must contact the backup file, in exceptional cases they can ask for the help of the founder.
The courts have so far granted relatively low compensation to the people, the amounts calculated on the basis of several hundred thousand, in exceptional cases, several million krona tables.
Pol<0xC3><0xBD>vka has lost the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the lawsuit for the title of the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
According to the judge of the district court of Ostrava, although he first used the name of the king of Vladivostok, the project was developed by the team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who collaborated with the actor, with many years of work.
Polyvka did not attend the hearing today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team living on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to Valachi's words, the actor-comic comes to mind.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> shares this view.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Investigating money and inventing actions,” he said.
He thinks the reason for the fight is money.
“Years later, they realized that the project was successful and they could gain something from it.
“They want to get out of our work,” he added.
Profit-producing business
According to the court, the name "King of Wales" was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka on a television show.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> was crowned.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing someone's passports.
The original student loan action became a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, after which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> founded the establishment of the society of the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed with his name and signature in the passports, and even when visiting his farm and theatre performances, he offered discounts to their owners.
Who is taking the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> himself used the idea, which Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka put to the public in the watch.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polyvka certainly helped the Valachi Kingdom project," the judge said.
However, he added that the soul of the project was the intensively engaged Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team.
The cooperation of the parties to the conflict today continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka organized an official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes have accumulated between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which have resulted in the release of "the eternally elected King Boleslav I".
At the initiative of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ulakov<0xC3><0xA1> took over the leading role in the kingdom as Mother Queen.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and her colleagues filed a lawsuit, which the court rejected today.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring light to the dispute for the throne and the queen.
He should be a new king from this fight.
He didn't want to tell you the details and the date.
“We don’t want to catch anything.
This should be something like a Slovak royal walk in the city.
The king should be elected for a fixed time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also apply," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: disappearing prejudices
Honestly, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
Menet’s characteristics are nothing special, the quality of the switch, the driving and the production can often be described as below average.
But its successor already on the market, the Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the truck called the SW goes one degree further, so there’s nothing left for me but to think about it better.
When I tested the Peugeot 207’s classic hatchback, for example, I complained about the seat left to my head in the back seat.
This time the complaint is over now, as the bodywork of the combi means that in this regard, the two-metre-high giants are not suffering anymore.
Foreman in the world
I'll get through the interior quickly so I don't repeat myself many times.
It’s a relatively successful design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer inventions, if the exterior of the car is already so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short bottom of the seat or armrests.
The side steering has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the space, there is also a noticeable increase in the size of the body.
After the van disappears the few places the head has already mentioned.
Suitcases in the trunk
The most important thing in this vehicle is the luggage compartment.
This is very accessible (even thanks to the foldable rear window) and I have to appreciate the spacious space.
The empty seats are equipped with retainers, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they're pullable, and they can handle more difficult objects.
But let's stay a little bit at the volume.
This is based on the tables in the basic layout of 428 l, which is more average than the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - compared to the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the young Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is far behind the noticeably many 52 liters.
This value is almost critical for a foreign holiday or when placing a stroller.
But if I should highlight the positives, then I have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the slope of the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a 1.6-litre, 88-kW four-cylinder, nerve-ignition engine.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look for the six hundred that drives the family's hatchback.
Quiet, low-consumption and mainly pulls.
Compared to the <0xC5><0xA0>koda adapter, which often acts as if it was packed in a sink, I can only enjoy it.
The price sucks
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and very good engine.
The car is still going for 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> with a four-cylinder foreign engine.
The car starts from 410 990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws the equipment away with an additional 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
But we also had our headphones, our automatic climate, our automatic wiper start, our rear windows and our electric remote control....
This means that the car will cost 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
This is a lot, but count the extras of Fabia and get a very similar result.
So there is nothing left but a decision on the side of the brand.
Integrating Slovak students into British schools has failed
There are more and more East European children in British schools, which has raised concerns among locals about the further development of local schooling.
At the moment, the integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between immigrants and children of local residents have turned into violence.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a situation in northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are escalating.
Conflicts between students, ties are already characterised by the relationships of parents.
In Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who had been stabbed by a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit is defended by the boy insulting him with racist sects.
The police also had to take action after the attack on two twelve-year-old Slovak immigrants.
The girls reportedly stabbed the man with racist remarks and threw him with stones.
"When we were going home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started barking at us.
When I told her to stop this, she hit us with apples and circles, and then she uncovered her naked back," the mother of the Slovak students wrote of the other unpleasant case to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the locals described the debates over Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants is beginning to become tense in British schools.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are clearly looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be accomplished if you choose the right one.
The golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, are calm as a fisherman.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or mammoth cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was the stronghold of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure trove and transport hall, which the Spaniards took away in America and shipped to Europe.
Then came the American Era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered criminal in the United States (primarily sexism), was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Tower houses were built in Havana, and cars were transported on the broad streets that became a symbol of worship in the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway purchased property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
What about today?
The Bodeguita wall in Havana can also be provided with a hand sign.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you can enjoy a cocktail of your choice.
And the cult cars of the 50s still operate in Havana today, as the once-exported snails and boys have long since escaped in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has largely collapsed, there are nowhere else in the area as many beautiful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are also becoming more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the much-needed money, the development of the green path has been given.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguin and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a unique delicacy in the world, which is especially appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, the candy was transported to the sugar cane plants by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renovated for decades, so there are machines that operate there, whose contemporaries are already visible elsewhere only in museums.
Where do we go?
The most well-known places are not avoided by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
It is not necessary to write too much about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that the Hemingway Heritage Museum already mentioned, and who loves the writer, should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from slaughter.
Stone formations, limestone-mountains and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has accumulated in their cavities, thanks to which the scattered ridges also cover dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
They can meet with their final form when visiting one of the Havana cigar-making plants.
Some may also find it interesting that there was a shot of Major Zeman’s Chilean episode.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city that was founded shortly after the colonization of the Spanish islands.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy took the body in the beauty and monumentality of a not too big city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by the later French settlers, had barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad between the Escambray plain and the sea is so uneventful that even in the 1950s there were no roads that would have connected this countryside with the rest of the country.
That kind of insulation helped him to stay out of it.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break it down, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it’s worth taking a look at the area’s sights such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach or the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening you can go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which wakes you up after dark, where the music is quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
The city in eastern Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
This view is probably already influenced by the road itself.
The two roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must overcome high and fragmented mountains, which are almost barely affected by human activity.
Due to the intact nature of Cuba, the eastern language of Cuba has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
Here the best chocolate is made, the church has a cross of Columbus (actually made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and the hill where the former castle stood and today the Hotel El Castillo, some of the plateau mountains are visible, the most famous of which is El Yu.
About coffee, rum, swamps, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Disno and the Island of Isla de Pinos, the cabaret of Tropicana, the patron saint of Caridad del Cobra in Cuba, the Santeria, the African religion that may be the religion of the former slaves.
That is, as they say rightly, it is better to see it once.
The Afghan allies are passive, the Americans say.
The lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment will also affect the course of the U.S. mission to Afghanistan.
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the next few years.
The Afghan mission is not as planned, the leaders of the countries agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, whose units are in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also advising on the further plans and coordination of the allies.
While U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has called for increased activity this week by NATO forces, the United Kingdom considers strengthening the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance to be a priority.
"Afghanistan's development is tangible, but military strength can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the public to initiate further development of the economy and security," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety per cent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of the Afghan insurgents is the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern areas.
However, according to the United States, the allies in the organization and equipment of the troops have also reached their limits.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to train the Afghan troops.
“We need to think seriously about the specific goals for the future and also the methods to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar spirit, Jaap de Hoop, NATO Secretary General, spoke today.
“I’m not happy with what’s happening in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
"We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out of Passive
In recent months, there has also been a debate among participating countries over whether allies are offering the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are in relatively large numbers in Afghanistan.
However, they have been deployed in areas where the least amount of violence and combat requirements are not as high against them as against us in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
This week, the British newspaper Sun called the German soldiers lustas.
"Afghan sunflowers are missing: the Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," Sun wrote in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went on a counterattack and published a photo of a British team’s rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt Reaches to One Billion in 2009
Every cheque has a government debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt reached SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government is planning to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to better development of the state budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s public debt reached 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year, it rose by 40.2 billion crowns.
By June, however, it had fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has today confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Each cheque is indebted to more than 84,000 kroner.
Last year, the state was indebted to more than 11 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to next year's lower deficit, we could only exceed the one-billion krone limit in 2009.
In the coming year, the debt will be around 900 billion and one trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Analyst of Next Finance, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Picora, said: “We can go through the transition of one trillion in 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget that is currently unknown.
If it were to prove that the situation in the field of politics would change, politicians would be willing to save more, this could be postponed until 2010.
But I don't assume that change," he said.
Increasing Debts
The state debt consists of the debts of the central government, which is mainly formed by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by banknotes, public loans, direct loans, or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased from 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion by the end of September and fell by SEK 13.7 billion from June.
The average maturity of government debt has risen to 6.5 years.
“Debt over the entire year increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is really quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in the case of loans, where the increase is 20 percent.
The bad thing is that debt increases, but on the other hand, it shows that it will have something to trade with when there will be pension reform," Picora said.
Better than Expected
The funding strategy and the 2007 government debt management report show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach this year’s estimated CZK 91.3 billion instead of CZK 76 billion.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency has a planned maximum of 13.3 billion kroons, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for pensions, a total of 43 billion kroons in public loans and a total of 1.8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
The schoolgirl appears today in a Carthusian court because of the name given to a plush cat
A Kartom court on Thursday night sentenced a British teacher to 15 days in prison and to be expelled from the country for violating Islam in Sudan, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6- to 7-year-old students to be called a plush mohammed, but the Islamic religion forbids her to portray her prophet in any way.
Such an act can be punishable by whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a teacher at Unity High School in Carthage, was arrested in her own apartment on Sunday. According to section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, she was accused of violating Islam and rebelling in the court after her parents filed several complaints.
The story began in September, when the schoolgirl asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's plush cat.
"A total of eight names were suggested by the children: including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," said Robert Boulos, the school's director.
Lastly, 20 of the 23 children voted for Mohamed’s first name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common surname in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with a photo of the cat and the inscription "My name is Mohamed".
The problem lies rather in the fact that any depiction of the Prophet is considered an infraction of Islam by any means.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague at the same school, said that she knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything that would violate any religious belief. She thought it was just an "innocent mistake". She said: "I'm sorry, I'm just sorry.
Many students of the student agree with this view. They think the student "does very well with the children" and "never talks about religion in the classroom".
Remember that Mohamed is also the second most popular surname in the UK, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This is a name so often chosen by Muslim families as a way of expressing respect for the prophet. (It is often given by the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the surname?
Is it possible to get that name for a game?
This is obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement at the last Vienna hearing on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result: failure.
The talks on the future status of the separatist province between Serbians and Kosovo Albanians ended without a convergence of positions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning.
"It is unfortunate that the parties did not agree on the status," Wolfgang Ischinger, an EU diplomat, told a news conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue even after the negotiations.
"In the near future, there will be no fear of violence, but there will be a very difficult period," he added, stressing the existence of "obvious tensions".
Mediation ends on December 10th.
On Monday, he will be visiting Serbia and Kosovo for the last time by an intermediary troika including the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
In 90% of Albanians, the future of the province can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian intermediary Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submit a report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
A meeting near Vienna, Baden, has been the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the United Nations entrusted the troika with further mediation in August last year.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation mission will be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already failed in the Security Council on the issue of Kosovo's independence, are insisting that negotiations continue even after the expiry of the deadline.
"Russia has been and will remain committed to the negotiated solution, along with the compromise," Bocan-Harchenko said.
A one-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN control for eight years, the Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready for a unilateral declaration of independence if the Security Council did not decide in her favour.
Belgrade would continue to support greater self-government.
“Unfortunately, we failed to reach an agreement,” Kosovo’s president Fatmir Sejdiu said at the hotel in Baden, where “the last chance talks” have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
He added, however, that his idea of Belgrade's autonomy "would be a continuation of the past, which is rooted in murders and deportations".
"Dominion Effects"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said the compromise was still possible and warned the majority of Kosovo Albanians about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is afraid of the “dominance effect” because of the independence wars of the 1990s in an unstable region.
"For Serbia, this does not preclude the possibility of a compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation again voted to make the decision exclusively to the Security Council, where Russia’s ally has veto power.
"The Kosovo Parliament will be the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“The negotiations have been going on for two years.
They must come to the same end where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "Kosovo's parliament will be the last word", adding that the Albanians' unilateral declaration of independence is based on an "agreement" with the Western powers.
Bush Urges Deal Between Israel and Palestine
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President George Bush announced on Tuesday at the opening of the international peace conference he held in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine have finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to a statement by Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately begin negotiations to settle a 60-year-long debate between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush pledged to support them in every possible way so that they could sign the “peace treaty” in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must account for the “terrorist networks” and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the 2003 “peace plan”.
The head of the White House stressed that the Abbasid-led negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel are aimed at "signing a peace treaty that resolves all dependent problems, including key issues."
The latter touches on three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who live on the territory of the present-day Israeli state.
Abbas, speaking after the U.S. president, insisted that future negotiations should be “global and profound” and affect all areas of regulation, such as “Jerusalem, refugee, border security, colonies, colonies.”
After that, Olmert promised that the future negotiations would “be direct and continuous,” and he would strive to “complete them as far back as 2008.”
At the end of 2008, Bush underlined the realization of the "two-state vision" of Palestinians and Israelis living side-by-side.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before it had decided to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose Annapolis participation was a success of Washington), with the support of all Arab countries, has initiated a plan that guarantees peace to Israel if it withdraws from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
“Annapolis represents an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab newspaper.
Prosecutors say the police are not held accountable.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and the speech contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of an investigation initiated by the National Police General Inspection Agency (IGPN), a police car passed on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car was patrolled, so it did not take part in the action. It ran at 40-50 km/h, without silencing," a police source said.
The young man without two helmets was driven at "high speed" by a green, "not listed in the official register, so it cannot be used in road traffic" (see below) with a Kawasaki-branded engine.
“Because they didn’t follow the right-hand rule, the engine collided with the left side of the police car,” one police officer said.
The result of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the collision, that the front of the car has collapsed, the windshield is cracked in the form of a star, and the bumper is broken.
In an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning, the State Prosecutor of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, said that she entrusted the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation, which was "condemned by negligence" and helped.
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said in a press briefing that in the current phase of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police is excluded.
According to the prosecutor’s statement, the witness interrogated in the incident three Sunday evening confirmed “the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.”
Yesterday, from a strip, which was undoubtedly pulled by the pedestrians on the roadway, they showed that the two vehicles collided and passed together for a while until the police car was unable to brake.
The vehicles have been booked for the purpose of technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were examined by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, a speech in Villiers-le-Bel spread like a running fire, according to which the police quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is cautious, but excludes that the police would have made "any serious mistake".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires an even more thorough investigation and greater caution during this," a police source said.
Libération met with an eyewitness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the location.
"My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, and I went immediately to try to revive them," the witness said.
"We couldn't do anything anymore."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely disturbed and shunned.
The other two tried to revive one of the young men, and the fourth phoned.”
Tensions were increasing among the attendees, as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the incoming policemen transported their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the statement of the witness that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also used a heart massage, but in vain.
"I wouldn't say that the police didn't try to help the young people.
The young people did get help.
The firefighters immediately arrived at the scene.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations following the state of emergency imposed by General Musarraf two days earlier.
Eyewitnesses said a lawyer protesting the measures in place in the eastern part of the country’s city of Lahore was injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers have been produced.
Similar incidents took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
Several people were produced.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s registered lawyers called for a general strike and protests were reported over the arrest of about 500 opposition members, a human rights fighter and lawyer over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed in order to prevent the assembly.
There were several demonstrations in Multan and northwestern Peshawar in the central part of the country.
Since Monday, the advocates' movement has been supported by the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which consolidates religious parties. Its leader "encouraged the people to send flowers to those judges who disagree with the state of emergency."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by an exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, the Court will have to declare the legality of President Musarraf’s re-election by an indirect vote on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by another.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings," he told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise to leave the front line of the army to fill the role of civilian president has "lost its validity" following the introduction of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Musarraf had to be freed from military uniforms until November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has also criticised the nationwide statement that President Musarraf would have appointed a place of forced labour as deputy general.
More than one-third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one-third (36 percent) of pregnancies are unplanned - according to a study by the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
According to Ined, different contraceptive methods, such as pills or beeswax, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the institute, the liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took birth control pills in 1970, but now this rate is already 60%.
Eight out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every five months, it is designed with precision, and if possible, for spring, as this is the most favorable season for the adoption of the child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular improvement of the solar panel that is indispensable to the station’s scientific activity.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in several respects: the repair took a very long time, had very little time to plan, and had to be carried out away from the housing modules with tools "scratched" by the astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a giant cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see framed section).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, it is necessary to take care of their power supply.
The second task of the crew, therefore, was to relocate one of the electricity generating modules, which was already on the ISS, to its final location using the 17.5-ton solar panels.
The crew then began to open the module’s 76-metre-wide solar panels.
One of the harmonically foldable boards then violated one of them with an inflated cable of about 1 meter in length.
In order to avoid further injury, the panel was not opened.
The astronauts were originally tasked with taking a control walk on the Discovery spacecraft and then repairing another faulty orbital solar panel. Instead, they had to spend their full time repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was given the choice to hang the spacecraft’s 30-metre robotic arm to the station’s crane.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
It is tall, strong, extremely skilled, has a muscular upper body and a long arm.
A 46-year-old man with a doctor’s degree had to “operate” the “injured” solar panel.
After thoroughly evaluating the damage caused, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with some "shells".
He also assisted in the work of another "spacewalker" who stayed near the safe passage, as well as other astronauts from within, including the crew's captain, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey robot, which was insulated against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented by the station's astronauts and "scratched" together.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for his companions to fully open the board, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day break, and today they returned seven times to the Discovery spacecraft to begin their planned return on Wednesday.
Decreased EADS Stock Rate
The EADS stock exchange has plunged sharply after the aircraft and defence equipment manufacturer announced that the extension of the development of the A400M aircraft will result in an additional cost of 1.2-1.4 billion euros.
The EADS share price is currently at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96, after a fall of 4%.
The company was forced to revise its forecasts for the 2007 operating result, as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which apparently delays the delivery of the aircraft as well.
The delay in the delivery of the fighter jet, which was announced in October, “will cost between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion, of which more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion will affect Airbus,” said the parent company of European manufacturing company EADS.
Due to the rise of these expenditures, EADS will have to announce new plan numbers for its operating result in 2007 on Thursday, when it will report its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide any additional figures.
The group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’s operating result fell by 86%: this was largely due to the delay in the development of another program, the A380 giant machine, which also put a huge financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M aircraft to the French military in October 2009.
Staying in the status quo
They are not promising a big surprise in Sunday’s elections: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s party, the United Russia.
In this, the Russians’ demand for stability, to say arbitrary governance, appears after a strongly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Vladimir Putin, the head of state of Russia, speaks in a televised message to the voters, which has already been recorded, but its contents are still secret.
Putin leads the Kremlin-backed party, the list of candidates for the United Russia, which is expected to produce a stunning victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the conduct of the head of state did not sell anything: it was just another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was the theme of the campaign.
"We know what the price of real democracy is, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any violation of the law," he said.
However, according to the opposition, this situation is short-lived.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they say they have been putting pressure on voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennagyi Zhuganov, claims that "there was no such dirty election in Russia even in the time of Yeltsin."
After last weekend’s demonstrations, former chess world champion Garri Kaszparovo was sentenced to five days in prison for not being allowed to protest and, according to his lawyer, he is not allowed to visit.
"The Russians still think of themselves as 'homo sovieticus'.
The predictable election results raise two, even more obvious, questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be on March 2, 2008, was published in the Official Gazette yesterday, and the candidates can indicate their intention to leave until December 23.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his term can no longer be extended.
There's no other successor in sight.
What role has Putin played since March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Will he, as leader of the almighty United Russia Party or the parliamentary majority, decide on the government and the president?
No matter what happens, the exiting power wins both the parliamentary and the presidential elections.
This has now become a tradition.
“The Russians are still thinking about the way ‘homo sovieticus’: they don’t feel like they can control their fate,” said Lev Gudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Kopossov, the historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, so that the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putyin came back to the paternalist model, which perfectly suited the people. All the more so, because this new kind of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation, but by a certain economic well-being." - believes Maria Alap<0xC3><0xAD>n, Car Lipman
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility on their own", which quickly became apparent after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all layers of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who are drawn from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And the freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
Public opinion has a preference for stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednychenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?”
Oppressive Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive, which documents the fate of the 17-and-a-half-million victims of the Hitler regime, became public.
The 47 million archival documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen in the province of Hesse, have so far only been researchable for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they have only provided an opportunity for unique and named insights to the victims or their descendants.
Eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to open the archives to researchers and historians.
After the ratification of the Convention by each state, the archives were opened yesterday.
Confidential Information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive allows historians to conduct research "on the relocation of detainees, on the residents of camps and on the health status of forced labour" - explains Reto Meistern, Judge of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have objected to the publication of the documents, as they also contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may be suspected homosexuality or a mental disability.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The purpose was to search for civilians who were deported or sentenced to forced labour on the basis of these and possibly serve as evidence of their internment.
At Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are currently working on the processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen Archives to be of outstanding importance.
"These documents basically do not contain anything new," said Wolfgang Benz, the director of the research center for anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India will sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is now approaching <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, said Peter Mandelson, the European Trade Commissioner and Kamal Nath, the Indian Minister of Commerce.
EU Foreign Ministers already approved in April last year that the European Commission will initiate negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 60 milliseconds of the European Union (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s largest foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU according to the European Commission’s figures.
Peter Mandelson said that "a free trade agreement could have an economic revitalizing effect for both parties" and "so India could increase its presence in a flourishing market with 450 million inhabitants".
In Europe, the two giants, Europe and Asia, each year, will be able to sell "47 billion euros worth of goods" and "10 billion euros worth of services" to the European Commission. In India, they will be able to trade in Europe with the main or secondary importer.

Bank of England Offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion to the Money Market for Five Weeks
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the worry about credit conditions, so it announced on Thursday that it is pumping <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion into the money market, which it will do this time with a 5.75% base rate and a five-week maturity.
"We wish to underline the concerns that the money market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like banks to be able to plan their liquidity position more securely - this is why the bank's reserves will not be transferred from their liquidity position to their own bank for this period."
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be released on the market on December 6, local time at 12:15. For the offer, the bank’s base rate is valid and the repayment deadline is January 10.
This is the first time the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for a period of five weeks as part of an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it was “ready to take further measures” to adjust interbank loans to the bank’s base rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: it is currently at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer money market crisis, the Bank of England has been charging significant penalty interest on money pumped into the money market, which has retarded banks from taking advantage of them.
According to the speech (which is only reinforced by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro), many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, to which they could have access with more favorable interest rates and greater discretion.
UMP and NC are unwilling to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power.
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre group closed the discussion of the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to the rejection of the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting, initiated by the Socialists, included about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the Socialist Party. These included, for example, a 50% increase in the salary of the employees and a 50% increase in the salary of the employees and a 50% increase in the salary of the employees.
As the UMP and the NC 180:115 voted against the review of the articles, the discussion of the government party and the opposition, which at times provoked a sharp change of voice, was finally interrupted. President Nicolas Sarkozy just hours before this happened.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would resubmit all its proposals as part of an amendment to the amending financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A New Festival Is Born
There have been a number of talks about the new Philadelphia music festival hosted by C3 Presents, but the company that organizes and promotes the event has now announced that it will be hosted in New Jersey in collaboration with Melvin Benn, a British producer and Festival Republic.
“It’s an honor for us to work with a person who is the initiator of today’s American festival movement,” Billboard.com’s Charlie Jones told C3.
C3 organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey takes place in the summer, so there will also be a way to camp.
The festival will take place between August 8 and 10, in a private area of 500 moons located about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The Festival Republic’s director, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he began organising the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his palette with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006, the Festival Republic brought the Latitude Festival to life in Suffolk’s Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival in the production, licensing and organisational roles. This festival can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3 collaborator Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspirational event" he has ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to make the region a European-style festival.
“We’ve chosen the location in Philadelphia before, and we’ve worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Committee to organize this festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
"We have been negotiating with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political manoeuvres of the city management, the organization has failed,” continued Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk about it with Melvin Benn, and we are now preparing to host a huge festival in another unique venue that ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after proving its exceptional talent for festival organizers at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events in 2007 was $9.8 million and $11.3 million.
Both festivals were held on the site of the city.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
“Our goal is to somehow combine the two models and thus create both the European rural atmosphere and the urban sense of life that is common in America.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s people, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastically supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not speak about the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favorable enough to allow investment in such an event in a place that hopefully will be home to the festival for a long time.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will have a “huge” size, with a capacity of approximately 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already received the invitation to the event, but at the time of the press release nothing is final.
“Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music so that everyone can find what’s right for them,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, form the C3 company, which received the "Best Independent Event Organizer" award at the most recent Billboard Touring Award.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to seduce Hollywood directors into Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator...
The "seduction" is one of the tasks of the Montreal envoy.
The mission promises to be “politically difficult” as California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to get into the fight with the "Governor of Terminator"?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best place.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions, on which we decide," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for the Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now mostly focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to showcase and promote as many Québec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it’s the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'<0xC3><0x81>ge des tén<0xC3><0xA8>bres received a favorable reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
The film Shake Hands with the Devil will be screened in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also represented itself with four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock exchange? Experts share opinion of the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their palms and are looking forward to the end of the usual year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will really happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, the stock market generally behaves positively in December.
But forecasts with a purely statistical background are not necessarily correct, and in fact, in the current situation, uncertainty characterizes the market, at least in the short term."
Experts are short-lived in favour of the onset of the stock market at the end of the year, although they state that "the stock market maintains the presence of liquidity, this gives an opportunity to invest in it, as it lacks the long-term alternatives with a guarantee".
Therefore, they say that the stock market will be characterized by a more side-by-side, non-volatility-free movement, "especially since the effect of the Fed rate reduction is not yet known, because the price of crude oil is high and also threatens inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, meaning it would be risky to declare that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, “the situation is not pink at all.”
Ibex’s loss is close to 4% compared to the highest recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Despite this, not all experts are so obnoxious.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, said Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of the wallets and payments to the regular pension fund.
In contrast, the expert adds that some change is expected this year, as the rally will be postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
Analysts consider it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to the technical level, and we may experience an aftermath of a fall in the stock market index, which may rise depending on the news from the US, as a result of the credit market crisis.”
The analysts are confident that these will be beneficial.
Analysts agree on what securities will be in order to achieve Ibex’s new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "this is the line on big securities".
The expert would include the two major banks and a few construction companies on the list, "since by then the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco said the increase was due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally can also be positive for construction companies, if at all, of course.
“The ACS has been trying to regain its positions for months and we hope that Ferrovial and the FCC construction companies will also follow this path,” the expert said.
Cyclical consumption will be the main protagonist for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales experienced during the Christmas period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also do well, although in this area the representation in the Spanish market is not too high.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, there have been only two occasions of December exchange rate fluctuations.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock market emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 adjusted 28.17 percent, there was a 6.68% jump in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year of profitability (currently Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally can take place.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol opens an account open from Monday to Saturday for 12 hours
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol has decided to renew most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 accounts located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change to the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose accounts are normally open continuously until 8:30 p.m. and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also voiced several times that it plans to extend its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it is only recently preparing an agreement with the unions that it would close 75% of its accounts to open one afternoon in return, though not for the public.
The experiences of Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol will be crucial for the other institutions, as they will decide on the basis of this whether they will join the initiative to support the more favourable opening of businesses.
This is the goal of the Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol project.
I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses who shop in these locations.
The bank wants to operate 200 accounts across Spain for 18 months with the aforementioned opening hours, because it is not a new opening order, but an existing conversion.
To this end, the institution modernises its accounts located in commercial areas according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new kind of thinking of the nature of the accounts, a more modern, colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, head of commercial banks, points out that there is no need for a large investment to reorganize, but they need to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per account instead of the current six.
Accounts, in which even small and medium-sized enterprises can be negotiated, will also sell non-financial products.
Favourite experiences
The initiative has already been implemented in the three Madrid accounts of Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero said the experience was positive.
In Madrid, Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, the choice was made and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 works under the Mundocredit name, specializes in immigrants, and also has a very favorable opening schedule, even on Sundays and public holidays.
The units mentioned in PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and will sell mobile phones with the help of external staff.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3’s stock market value for the first time
"We did it."
With this statement yesterday, Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s trusted advisor, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market, when it was revealed that the TV channel he led had doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One thing, however, overshadowed her joy: “It only hurts that it is not because we have risen more, but because we are less,” he said.
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, we are "lesser".
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54% increase in strength.
This increase puts the annual loss at 15.66% of the total.
Mediaset owns 52 percent of the company, Vocento owns 13 percent, and Bloomberg’s stock market value is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million.
Its rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has been able to account for a 40.5 percent decline since January, half of which reached 2,193.46 million yesterday.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with the Antena 3 can be attributed to the similarity between the two companies.
The question is just how much we can accomplish in the same market, at what costs, and how this all comes about in terms of view.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to be the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco’s senior advisor and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s subsidiary.
If the reported fact is true, the TV channel’s advertising revenue would increase by 3.6 per cent, compared to the 965.4 million in the 2006 financial year.
Antena 3’s net sales increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (to 734.4 million), while television’s net sales increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors driving the rise of Telecinco’s stock exchanges is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, it distributed 100% of the company’s revenues, led by President Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it would be too early to decide, this ratio could change after the acquisition of Endemol 33% with its parent company, in association with Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum payment of 50%, although we have always allocated a lot more.
I hope that our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already benefited them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently characterised by some slowdown.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its earnings estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
According to their report, this is due to the estimated increase in sales from 10.5 percent in 2008 to 8.4 percent, and from 5.5 percent in 2009 to 5.1 percent.
The same company forecasts that the profit of Antena 3 will decrease by 4.5 percent in 2008 and by 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 Opinions
One.
Ibersecurities: suggests buying both securities, mainly due to the high profitability of the dividend and the long-term sustainable potential.
Two.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is seen as more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (maintenance) because of its "multiple attraction" and business strength.
Three.
JPMorgan: In both cases, underweighting is proposed due to "similar risks" (a saturated market and an unfavourable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary process - which closed today with a congressional vote approving the Senate amendments - the government initiated a social dialogue on the regulation underpinning the law, so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups consistently highlighted the efforts of the representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements, which are in the interest of establishing the most favourable normative measures to protect investors, as well as the detailed regulation of the activities of the companies.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, makes it possible to modernize the money markets, while at the same time strengthening the protection of investors, expands the separate rights of the European Supervisory Board of the Spanish National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV).
The new Directive allows financial advisory services for specialised firms, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for companies selling securities, securities agencies, and management firms, to create a new fund in addition to the company(s) of the company(s).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems suitable for the execution of transactions involving funds, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets the internalisation systems with which multilateral trading platforms and the execution of orders are being carried out .The present version of the internalisation systems
In addition, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide market information on the defining aspects of their business profile, on their risk-taking and risk management methods, as well as on the basis of a record of all implementations to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Congressional Economic Committee has tabled a number of amendments. Of these, it is of particular importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds, i.e. because of the high risk of subsidizing the investor. This is a high-risk American mortgage.
On the other hand, the transposition of the Directive was also used to legally align the scope of activity of those with economic and business qualifications, 30 years after the entry into force of the Regulation in 1977, which can only be implemented by economic operators.
The Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent who works for another account, does not need a CNMV license, and can sell products or acquire customers to multiple investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and thus reached 4.1%.
This figure, which Eurostat takes into account in the calculation of the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of the time and nature of their creation.
The calculation method is the same as for the calculation of the standardised price index, but the statistical modelling method is different for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary figure is purely informative and may therefore differ from the final data that will be made public on 14 December.
“The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value.”
Pedro Solbes, one of the vice presidents of the government and the Minister of Economy, said that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only "temporary", but at the same time indicated that the price index would be expected to show a "relatively high" value in the future.
In the corridors of the Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although the figure is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained at more or less the same level within the monetary union in recent years.
He added that the month of November brought “less surprises” than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged in connection with the data released during the day.
Through Northern Rock, Virgin wants to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion in three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and are currently only worth <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 billion) since it went into a crisis in mid-September and had to borrow urgently from the National Bank of England.
At the time, he still had a record-breaking deposit of more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, the number of which has gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of trust from customers, despite the Government’s promise of a hundred percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Under Virgin’s own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money will operate this unit. Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of the revenues of British banks over the next three years in order to earn the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion, and that’s <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
Richard Branson, a group of high-profile businessmen known for his high-profile advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend around <0xC2><0xA3>50m (<0xC2><0xA3>70m) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its intended goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the Virgin consortium’s offer as the most favorable for avoiding bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies make up the consortium.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Suspected Corruption Case
The police arrested the mayor of Totana, a town in Murcia province, this morning on suspicion of being involved in the city’s corruption scandal that erupted this week.
In addition, a secretary of the City Hall and the chief of police of the village were arrested.
In May, José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, a former member of the city’s parliament, took the seat of the MP Juan Morales, who may have been the head of the corruption network, according to official bodies interviewed by the SER radio channel.
The police are continuing to investigate the city’s offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
His lawyer, Juan Morales, has also been investigated as the main suspect in this week’s corruption scandal.
According to the SER radio station, the lawyer of the People's Party, Juan Morales, was arrested when he left Morales in his pocket.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged fee that Morales received in exchange for signing an agreement with a construction company in Galicia to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Currently, eight people are under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the office of the President of Parliament if he wins the election.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Socialist Party’s Secretary General, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE’s Toledo list in the next parliamentary elections and fill out the official presidential list in the parliamentary elections.
This was announced by PSOE Organization Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and Bono himself confirmed at the party’s federal headquarters this afternoon after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his election to the former minister by saying that "we must count with the best" in politics and that Bono is "among the best".
In addition, he added that "probably" the Mancha politician will be the Socialist Party's nominee for President of Parliament if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would take over the seat of the current Parliamentary President Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who announced on November 15 that he does not intend to run in the next elections and give up his political career rather in scientific circles then fight against climate change.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has been constantly pushing for a return to the political scene since he gave up active politicization two years ago.
He added that, as voters are aware of who the economic vice-president will be in the event of the Socialists’ victory, the party would have wanted to inform them of who will be the president of the parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill the post, he wants Parliament to be a "scene of respect and not of insult or shouting" and more like the home of the citizens.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the parliament is the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to have a quiet conversation, it has already happened that the Prime Minister's speech was interrupted 26 times in the Senate."
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, for his "excellent work", but he did not want to present himself as president, so that his opponents would not be seen as "survivors".
A campaign for the climate
Since the climate change movement relentlessly pursues both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social affiliations, it must be very strong.
He must also stand by a political leader like Prime Minister Zapatero, who says that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and announces that “we need to make a new agreement with our Earth.”
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to Spain’s leading in the Union’s failure to comply with the Kyoto Convention.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why has the Government not tried to avoid it?
In addition, it should be clear to the Spaniards what measures they intend to take in order to mitigate climate change.
What companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population should be changed, what individual and social level of energy savings should be expected, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to make sacrifices and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not, and will not, get an explanation of these issues.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has brought about measures, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, inconvenient and cost-effective for both companies and the public.
Even PSOE’s gasoline production would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew.
That is to say, we must save the Earth from nothing, with mere propaganda texts, with empty passwords free from actual consequences.
With conventions, committees, protocols, new offices.
With the agreement with the Earth, as the head of government says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, and even beautifies the election assemblies and awakens tenderness in us.
Isabella
The mayor of Totana and the chief of police have been arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The police arrested the mayor of Totana in the Murcai province, José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreot, the local chief of police, the secretary of the City Hall and a businessman in the hospitality industry for crimes related to urban development.
The mayor was arrested in his home and transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the municipal body responsible for the management of the Municipal Development Council and the Departments and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded by the arrests of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on Monday in connection with a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land could be built into a plot of land, so that they could be allowed to transfer their property to the 4000 inhabitants of Galicia.
Two other people have not yet been arrested, but they are under investigation, according to the Totana Court No. 1 information.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, Totana’s former mayor Juan Morales, who is now also an independent MP for the People’s Party, is under investigation.
The ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also examined, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the provincial center of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A. lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigeria (Pontevedra), together with the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G. This latter company belongs to the Nuaria Group.
The investigation is carried out by a group charged with crimes committed at the Municipal level of the Central Operational Unit of the Police, whose members carried out eleven domestic investigations in addition to the arrests, mainly in Laszr<0xC3><0xA1>d (Madrid, Madrid, Spain).
In Totana, one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the area, who could have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created Totana’s largest residential park with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired an area of 2.2 million square meters in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement currently with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigo, which manages the streets of Coruna, Venezuela, and the parking lot of the Catholic Ferdinand Square, Conycase, with its specialty in direct marketing, with its sales and sales departments.
Things that will eat.

If you agree, we'll put aside the Book of the Month a little bit and see if we can get some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already got one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can come up with something for themselves.

Our Finnish journalist found this comment in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (certainly at the forefront of the PISA report on the world’s cultural level), in the Helsinki Sanomat, referring to what was published on November 18 along with the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
“Philosophical teachings were presented to the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
In the messages of the killer, a high school student cited the writings of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, Educational Councillor in charge of teaching philosophy, in the pages of the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper, demanded that teachers examine Plato’s teachings with a critical eye, and then added that Nietzsche’s knowledge was not necessarily important to the elementary school’s obligatory level.

One of our colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains an offence related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a crime and can be punished for six months to one year.
However, if you steal a record of less than 400 euros in a store, it is only a violation of the rules (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1000 in a store, the theft is a crime, but the penalty still does not reach the penalty for downloading on the Internet (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but take it back after 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the penalty for downloading online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect a smaller penalty if you mix in a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass rally, you can receive a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the BTK), but a penalty of six months to two years for copying the CD
(Article 270 of BTK).
According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD movie.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors should be punished more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, someone's got a lot of things out of his hands.

I received an article from my GP on weird research titled, "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it."
That is, the feelings of the workers on the day of pay depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonance imaging and the results were also published in the latest issue of Science.
Bernd Weber, the study’s author and head of the Neurocognition Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, said: “The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly, but the partner was wrong.”
The researchers found that if they both gave the right answer and received the same amount of cash rewards, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why it took so much science to come to such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been chasing the Balkan war criminals in The Hague for eight years, from the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court investigating crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
The mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a bit of a bitter nose, as the responsible for the Srebrenica massacre, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, namely General Ratko Mladic and the Bosnian leader Radov<0xC3><0xA1>n Karadzic.
Their names are on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach for his documentary: Carla's list (2006, not yet presented in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor-general in the same way as a real crime. It follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor-general until the end of the year in Belgrade.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Vehicle insurance, which provides security for the owner of the car with significant expenses in relation to the various incidents of damage and also depends on several factors, such as age, gender, the date of obtaining the licence, the family status, and the machine to be insured.
Buying a car is just the first step.
Choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insured and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company assumes compensation in the amount of the fixed insurance fee in the event of the occurrence of the damage event.
The insurance fee is basically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, the date of the licence, the family status, the type of car to be insured, its use, and more.
The insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of the statistics, i.e. a higher amount paid by the person who represents a higher risk of accidents.
That’s why women are over the age of 25, or women pay less because, according to statistics, they’re at a lower risk because they’re more cautious.
Similarly, according to the findings, insurance companies have come to the conclusion that those who live in marriage also cause fewer accidents than those who are single.
The frequency of use of the car is decisive.
In more frequent use, the chances of an accident increase.
When determining the insurance premium, a number of factors are taken into account by the insurance companies.
Therefore, the owner needs to look carefully to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the most important factors in the selection, in order to be able to best adapt to the needs of the insured and to create an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under 25 years of age have to face a number of disadvantages, such as a lack of driving experience and the freshness of their driving licence.
Although it is most ideal to be protected against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
Precautionary drivers will be able to self-insurance, so they will be insured against all hazards and the price will be affordable.
For this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
“The amount of self-employment paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the self-employment,” said Luis Noguera, the head of First Europe, an Internet insurance brokerage in Spain.
Another option is extended liability insurance to third parties when the customer insures himself against damages caused to others, but not against damages caused in his own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire damage and the loss of the car.
That's good advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as this will have an impact on the bonus and thus reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
Benefits granted against the basic rate of the insurance company are referred to as bonuses.
A penalty that has been abolished against the basic rate is called a malus.
"The amount of the bonus and the malus depends on the insurance company and its profitability.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to raise the bonus," explains Noguera.
If you have already crossed the age limit of 25 years, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
In this case, we advise you to take full insurance with self-esteem.
"Usually, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in an accident, not even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the drivers are behind the brakes.
If the insured is already married but does not yet have children, it is best to take full insurance, of course, if your financial options allow it.
Insurance companies consider child marriages to be the clients with the lowest risk, so in their case, the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, it is best to complete the insurance with self-insurance (it can reach 300 euros), or if they have a higher bonus, they can extend the insurance from the third year of the vehicle to the damage caused to the other.
“They drive more calmly, but at the same time have more customer power and can afford to have a higher self-esteem,” Luis Noguera says.
For pensioners, we recommend full insurance with self-employment (which is around 150 euros), or in case of a higher bonus, it can also be extended to liability insurance.
Vehicle insurance is very important, not only because it means protection for the owner in the event of damages, but also because it means a large expense, therefore it is essential to choose the appropriate form of personalized insurance.
Celtic wants to score a point in Milan to get into the eighth round.
On Tuesday, Milan and Celtic teamed up at the San Siro Stadium to score the missing point at the close of the Champions League, where the Italians would be the first to qualify and the Scots would qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already in the fifth round they have secured a draw with Portugal, but the Celtic have nine points, but one more would be needed for the six-pointer Shakhtar, who will fight the four-pointer Benfica, not to go ahead.
Group D’s two matches will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championships, where on the 13th he is trying to advance to the 16th final.
Group D will end sooner than the rest, and although the most likely result at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the draw, the two teams strive to win, as the Italians do not want to be left at home, and Celtic can be the first to start from a better place.
Gordon Strachan's defeat is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be sure because if there's a point equality, the Ukrainians will move on, who lost at Glasgow last week (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the night sad for the Scots, who want to get into the Champions League eighth-place finish twice in a row, after just a goal from Kaka in the previous season (1-0 to 0 in a draw).
Shakhtar would be most happy to win the "Rossonerik" because if he lost to Celtic he would enter the eighth round and remain in UEFA.
As Benfica, despite being in the last place at the moment and having no chance of staying in the European Championship, can still take third place with a win that could be played in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 spectators for the first time since they split up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were organized at GM Place in Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people exchanged tickets to attend the concert, where they also presented a video of the band’s success story in the 1990s.
With the band's re-composition and the tour, EMI also released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage in a bracelet received from their husband, "Posh Spice", from British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the crowded GM Place, although a few days earlier Victoria had banned him.
At the time of the performance, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "hasn't seen our acting outfit yet, so then I'm nervous about what she's going to think about the performance."
'Sporty Spice', was the reason the band split up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I've seen how people's feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
I thought why not? Now I'm glad I made that decision," Chisholm said of the band, which had split up nine years earlier.
The singer also added that over time "things have been arranged and we love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television reports, Virgin Airlines arrived in Vancouver on a separate plane.
A group of babysitters were waiting for them at the airport.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
The event will take place in Madrid on December 23.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has resumed, which could also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is carried through Ukraine and the discussions between the two nations are always of great concern.
Kiev has said that if Moscow raises the gas tariffs paid by the Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, the supply to EU countries was reduced.
The most recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly on Gazprom’s attempt to reach an agreement on the amount of gas to be paid to Russia by Ukraine in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it needs to make a 50% increase in the price of gas extracted from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the 2008 price agreement with Ukraine.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% price increase for shipments from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important that during the negotiations we argue in accordance with one of the most important transit countries for natural gas," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
"The gas-related changes should in any case be linked to our discussion of the cost of transits through Ukraine (and to Western Europe)."
As a result of the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which at the same time significantly pushed up prices.
A quarter of the European Union’s gas supply is Russian gas.
Russia has the world’s largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Soviet states.
The NHS is "compulsory to inspect foreign workers"
Scottish NHS committees need to improve checks on the criminal record of workers arriving from outside of Europe, a supervisory body said on Wednesday.
The proposal was made by Robert Black after a doctor of foreign nationality in Scotland was linked to the attack on the Glasgow airport in June, according to the BBC.
Black also expressed concern that the NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas employees.
At the same time, in its report - through a sample of five health authorities - it also pointed out key checks that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on the Glasgow airport, the inspector general checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Bilal Abdullahot, 28, a doctor from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, Iraq, was arrested at the airport after a jet hit the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors who were interrogated by the Old Bailey court in October on charges of attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom by video link.
The NHS Committees shall, in the case of their employees from overseas countries, verify the existence of the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned, as well as the permits required to work in the United Kingdom, prior to the start of employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees employ Disclosure Scotland for the purpose of verifying the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of the United Kingdom.
The report of the Auditor General proposed, among other things, that the committees should introduce a Guide to the Criminal Records Office, which would facilitate for the employer the control processes carried out with the various overseas countries.
"Although we have found evidence of such checks among the records made by the staff, they are not being carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS is fulfilling its own pre-employment review procedure at a high level, adding: “Our report highlights areas of the system that can be developed in order to provide us with up-to-date information on the NHS’s overseas personnel numbers.”
Dr Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unrealistic” to use pre-employment checks to identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"According to the report, the pre-employment checks currently in place are working well in the NHS Scotland and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent," he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the majority of their overseas staff, consisting of doctors and nurses, currently employs 1,161 people.
However, the rapporteur-general pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly due to the problem for the committees in identifying employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of the passport, the work permit and the documents certifying the professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is still examining the directive and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS employees from overseas countries.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was a great pleasure to be able to carry out this task after the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that all employees - including those from overseas countries - will be informed of the best time to apply for pre-employment checks.
The Joy Division takes part in the film awards ceremony
The biopic "Control" by former Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards in the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Picture Award.
The award was also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse prior to Curtis's formation, as well as director Anton Corbijn and co-starring Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won the Best Actress Award with the thriller "Details of a Scandal".
The Variety Award – for bringing the British film to the international spotlight – was presented by Bond creator Daniel Craig.
The awards were presented as part of a celebration held at the Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control" depicts the rise of Curtis within the birches of the Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film "The Killers", "David Bowie" and "New Order on the soundtrack" cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Dutch photographer Corbijn, who had previously become known for making U2's "Joshua Tree" album cover, won two awards, including Best Director and Best Starter Director.
Another winner of the ceremony put rock music in the spotlight; Julien Temple's Joe Strummer, the Clash singer, won the award for Best Documentary.
The award for best actor was awarded to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of David Cronenberg's London-based thriller "The Murder Promises" as the mafia boss.
Ray Winstone, best known for his hard-bodied roles, was awarded the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contributions to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name includes the films "Scum", "Ehkopon" and "Sexy Doll", is currently involved in the filming of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to be the recipient of the award for "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" from his late 2002 star, Harris.
“For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door,” Winstone said.
“I’m really lucky to have met Richard Harris on several occasions.
"Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his age, and I really appreciate him."
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bifa include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people in connection with a terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants trapped in terrorist cells had been arrested and planned to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as a strike targeting several ecclesiastical persons and security forces.
According to state television, the world’s largest oil exporter, one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been acting as an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to TV news reports, eight cells, led by a resident of a foreign national, are planned to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
Saudi Arabia has begun building a 35,000-strong rapid-response force to protect the facilities after Al-Qaeda in 2006, the world’s largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq.
According to a report citing the words of the interior minister, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell that is led by a "person specializing in missile launches" that crosses the border illegally.
The report also reported that the fighters were attempting to smuggle eight shells into the kingdom’s territory.
Twenty-two of those arrested have made plans to carry out assassinations against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called for tougher action on ecclesiastical leaders to curb the Saudis, who are joining al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who are fighting against the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government.
Al-Qaida fighters see a significant proportion of Saudi church leaders as being involved by the authorities in the backing of the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The militants, aroused by the call of Saudi-born leader Osama bin Laden to target the Western Saudi government, targeted foreign-inhabited settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
“The security forces have made enormous efforts in the past ... five months,” a State TV spokesperson for the interior ministry said in a statement.
During the arrests, a 16-person "media cell" was also captured in Medina, the purpose of which was to spread "Takfir thought."Takfir thinking is an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which is an insult to the infidels and the disbelieving.
In addition, 32 people were arrested and charged with the financial support of the militants.
The climate of Venus could provide an outlook for the future of the Earth
According to scientists yesterday, Venus was once able to provide pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet is much more regarded as Earth’s stinking twin brother than we previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbits are similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that billions of years ago, there may have been very similar living conditions on Venus to Earth, and even habitable conditions may have occurred.
However, due to the exceptionally high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the planet's lower rotational velocity, Venus has entered a slightly different developmental orbit.
Today the water has evaporated from the planet, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, and hurricane-force winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft - based on a one-year study of the planet - paint a disastrous picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, who is also the head of the Venus Express mission, said: “It is beginning to wonder why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth as it is as it is, so much as it is experienced on Earth.
"Our new data made it possible to develop a scenario of the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could still have a habitable environment similar to Earth.
"Enriched uranium" occupied by the police
A kilogram of radioactive material - reportedly enriched with uranium - was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the matter was investigated.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said the material could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Open Doors Widely
Mitt Romney says he is not worthy of a candidate running for president to answer questions from a snowman.
The Republican candidates for the presidential election, however, agreed to participate in a live-streamed debate on YouTube, in which regular voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions put on Wednesday night proved as ridiculous as the snowman’s, who asked the Democrats about global warming in a debate broadcast by the other party on YouTube.
The questions and answers, however, this time well reflected the position of the Republican party approaching next year’s election.
At the moment, it is not known whether CNN’s co-financing executives selected YouTube clips that were distributed to the candidates on the basis of what exactly.
The longest debate in the first half-hour of the debate was on immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' chemistry.
CNN has asked some insecure voters to dial a number if it sounds like a belligerent to them: the intermediary experienced a high consensus when the candidates made a hard statement on the issue of borders.
The most lively and longest debate took place between nationally leading Rudy Giuliani and leading Romney in crucial elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image he has created that during his time as a New York City mayor, he handled the issue of illegal immigration too easily.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants from the former governor of Massachusetts to build his house.
The conflict between the two became particularly fierce when the respondents were interested in the support of "amnesty" (which would provide permanent status and citizenship opportunities for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes – such as Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado – have managed to delve deeply into the topic.
And while none of them counts as likely to be nominated, their stay on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they began to conflate the noise of immigration earlier and louder than the others.
At least in the area of immigration, there is a broad consensus among the candidates: a common objective of strengthening the borders and a tough action against illegal immigrants.
This theme – as well as the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors coming from the outside world – encourages Republicans within the berkes to forget or to minimally forget the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics were raised, the debate was very unpleasantly dissipated.
Giuliani had to deal with the question of why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated water immersion should be considered torture.
Another questioner was wondering if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this context, Giuliani finally clung to the point of view that although his favorite book is the Bible, he might not literally interpret the story of Jonah and the whale.
A further question was raised as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who took the first place in the Iowa election – who had his victory thanks to persistent Christian conservativeism – reacted to expectations that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When asked whether Jesus would receive enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than he was to go to the polls.
The competition is still unusually open.
Huckabee’s pulsating upheaval in Iowa coincides with libertarian Ron Paul’s fundraising campaign and the enthusiastic thrill of Wednesday’s debate.
The sudden breakthrough of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to start a joint candidate from among the aspirants who represent more familiar and more traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who in time and convincingly shouted the message of victory proclaiming the greatness of America, and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party has split, and the consequences of this are currently invisible.
Worker's Pain
Another gap breaks in front of Gordon Brown; the way out remains unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the present does not seem too picky.
No one has sold his honor, no politician has been shown his hotel bills in Paris, and no one has committed an extramarital scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the name of others, for more than four years, had contributed more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) to the Labour Party of the United Kingdom, and that the party had not been good enough to report it to them, Brown said.
Two months ago, when the prime minister missed the election, and when his statement - that public opinion polls did not affect the outcome of the decision - thoughtlessly questioned the British's intellectual ability to assert that the people of Brown are still in a state of hope.
Instead, however, as noted by Vince Cable, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, with increasingly spiritual remarks, he transformed from the once feared Brown Stalin into Mr. Bean.
The bailout of a bank in need called Northern Rock has put regulatory flaws and judgemental flaws at a crossroads.
The patient proposals for the amendment of the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to come together against the government.
The loss of the personal data of the 25 million people by the tax authority has exposed an unimaginably high level of administrative unrest.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals protested against a reduction in the army's budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Homeland Security was a part-time occupation.
And now there are David Abrahams’s mysterious donations; Peter Watt, the Labour Party’s secretary general (formerly administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents do not mean that Brown could not turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point at which control is impermissible.
People don’t like politicians and don’t trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
As soon as it becomes clear, however, that the Prime Minister is most likely not fit to pre-empt things, and may not remain in office for a long time, the end of the suspended infidelity is coming to an end: the civil servants’ arms will be smashed and the cabinet will be smashed.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation because, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
No matter how much he wanted to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are linked to decisions made during the time of Brown’s finance ministry.
And while Blair was not directly involved in any moves – such as a lengthy examination of the relationship between the issue of "nobility for money" and political party funding – voters may rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The shots taken are not as scary as the torics indicate them.
As in Mr. Bean's case, no one was killed, no one was taken directly from him.
Compensation, however painful it may be, can be the creation of the direction that Stalin, who lives in Brown, has always promised: reliable, solid and slightly tough governance.
A good example of this is political donation.
The Garboian celebrity Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, stated that he did not want to disclose his favor to the public.
Perhaps it is, however, that the decision was not within his jurisdiction.
The law banning the anonymity of big political supporters can be clearly and clearly justified: the public has the right to know who knocks at the door of the country’s rulers.
Watt, who knew according to his own account of Abraham’s measure, but was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the interrogations; as will Jon Medleson, the head of the Labor Party’s foundation, who was well-versed in October.
However, for Brown, for the time being, the threads are not leading: nothing indicates that he knew about these reels, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of his job.
Although he condemned the violation of the law committed by his party at an early age, he diluted his strength by reaching for a familiar device; in investigating the case - for the sake of security - he entrusted a retired bishop and a biography under the direction of a judge.
In this story, the "learning to be learned" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown needs to fix other things, such as appointing the chairman of an independent committee on administrative rules that has been running without a leader for six months, or an advance for effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-line Labour Party to cooperate with the Turks and break off the special financial ties associated with the associations – it would already be a hard wall for the partisan Brown.
But you have to face some of the party-related facts.
According to the polls, the Conservatives are currently leading with a serious advantage; Brown has two years to recapture the voters behind him; the only way to dispose of the victory is uncompromising integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the Second-Market Mortgage Market Crisis Threatening the American Credit Card Market?
If blood gets into the water, it is natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is weakening, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of public loans, the loss of the credit card market could reach as much as $99 billion.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the descriptive rate showing the ratio of non-recoverable loans and the default rate indicating the ratio of late payments beyond 30 days have increased.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss in the U.S. consumer finance segment last month, in part due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
However, the panic is still early.
The rate of depreciation and late payments remains low.
The Moody's credit rating agency's third-quarter late payment rate of 3.89% is a full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The reduction in rates is partly due to technical factors.
The amendment of the U.S. insolvency rules in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency applicants, but at the same time it resulted in a large loss of the total number of credit card market losses; a decrease in the number of insolvency claims, and a decrease in the number of insolvency claims.
The rate of payment, which shows the proportion of monthly credit depreciation by consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, the confidence in credit card-covered securities is also quite strong, despite the weakness that has developed in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney, from the TowerGroup research company, estimates that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to eliminate mortgages.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor the movement of money and not the asset value, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may be beneficial for the creditors as well.
If the property is less than the value of the mortgage, the incentive for consumers to cancel the loan will be reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will move forward in the priority rank.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers are able to adapt more quickly and flexibly to changing conditions than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden recharging of assets.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up to fully revaluate the loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much more likely.
If declining housing market prices and a fall in lending put America in recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a tough future.
It is worth keeping an eye on those predatory swamps.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
He pleaded guilty on Wednesday to three British bankers who were brought before court to investigate their role in a fraud involving Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent in the charge of weekly fraud, allegedly cooperating with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000, which they wanted to enrich at the expense of their employer.
Their hearings began in January.
But at a court hearing, U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them confessed to his guilt in the continual fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group’s Greenwich NatWest division became known in the UK for the two-year extradition procedure.
The conclusion of the investigation of the case launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
A first indictment against them warned Fastow in 2002 that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers who had been crucified by the NatWest Triangle were accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare for the fraud along with Fastow and Michael Kopper, who was the right-hand man of the time.
Fastow, who was responsible for planning the numerous scams that bankrupt Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any existing shareholdings in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the interest was very high.
A company managed by Kopper has acquired the bank’s $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in order to get a stake in this company.
Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying a $20 million share in the company from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The indictment alleges that the bankers reached $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others reached $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to two-tier crime for his role in the collapse of Enron.
Three of the British men were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a prison in Texarkana.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States for a $1 million bail per head, where they stayed for the duration of the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. company to go bankrupt in December 2001, after the accounting tricks used for years could no longer cover the millions accrued as debt, and the loss reported to the earner.
Thousands of jobs have collapsed, the market value has fallen by more than $60 billion, and the value of pension funds has fallen by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year for their crimes in the company’s bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges against Lay have ended with the man's death last year.
There is No Poverty in Moscow
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine will start its journey from Moscow to Los Angeles with a tank.
But this amount is only a small amount of money for some Russian rich people.
“18 passengers fit in,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one is ordering so many seats because the machines are bought for private families or corporate executives."
Mr. Firer was looking forward to the visitors at the four-day exclusive Milliomos Fair, which was held in the huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods carriers rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that Russian newcomers will be interested in everything from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-covered 50-cent refrigeration grilles.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche displayed on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it doesn't match our products," he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
It seems that the Russian capital is floating in the money as Dallas did in its luminosity at the time of the oil explosion.
“We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered more material here,” said Marshall Goldman, senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians have now emerged as the most spectacular spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands claim their share of the gold ribbon.
At a conference hosted by the luxury industry in Moscow, LVMH President Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of richest people, there are 53 billion people in Russia who have a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103 thousand, who may have a total of $670 billion, according to a personal development analyst in the territory of the former Soviet Union, the Economic and Financial Research Center of the Faculty of Economics and Finance.
(According to data from the World Bank in 2005, the number of people living below the minimum was 15.8 percent in Russia.)
“Hundreds of millions live in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London’s David Morris jewellery store.
For the first time, Nicole participated in the trade fair with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women have been cared for without excuse, and men are a real treasure trove.”
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, dressed in their evening clothes on Sunday night, both attributed themselves and their clients to millionaires.
"I've looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who shoved in his uniquely-designed outfit, as if he'd already gotten used to this lift.
The fair was organized mainly for the new rich, for those brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to go around a wired, digitally decorated site after several hours in traffic, where they can find mac<0xC3><0xB3>ss<0xC3><0xB3>ss<0xC3><0xB3>ss<0xC3><0xB3>gs<0xC3><0xA1>lm<0xC3><0xA1>s, cadillac escaleds<0xC3><0xB3>ds, platinum pockets.
For the average person, the ticket costs 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who, with a patriotic view, took a seat at the Dutch porcelain manufacturer, Royal Delft, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue replacement.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in the outstanding things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the rich Russians for a long time (according to the Russian standards this means 10-15 years) have already switched from the eraser logos to such tiny, limited-numbered brands that would not enter a trade fair.
Yet thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires’ trustees, and tourists, were crowded every day.
And some of them bought it.
On the first day of the show, on Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of King Koil’s bedding company, said that he sold two mattresses, each worth $70,000, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with goldware.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, A1 Moto’s sales associate who handles the modern alarm for high-quality cars, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millio for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer that delivers a solution for individual needs, sold three refrigeration grilles to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grilles are similar to wired linkages.
The reporters also showed a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which Swarovski said was wearing crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set: $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants a picture of his wife’s face with a zirconium cube, will not necessarily use these objects,” Karapetian said.
"Helyette will keep them in the garage that keeps the 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of the Russian clients are wealthy, according to Karapetian, the term "Russian millionaire" today does not mean a great privilege, given the rapid rise of the local real estate prices.
“Those who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago are most likely millionaires today, if not in money, but at least on paper,” he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires, at least, could have created the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of the Russian wealth management company Alliance Continental.
The company has built four English-style telephone booths, which have been amassed with millions of fake-dollar banks.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires’ Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money. Many took pictures of themselves with a mobile phone as they shoved into the money box or just put a few million in their pockets.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Surgery: Suspected for Surgery After Death in New Jersey
The day before the Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the window of a restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Shortly thereafter, a police car arrived.
Then another one.
“Then I saw the doctor’s car stop,” said Mr Livingston, one of the supervisors working at the restaurant.
"I knew then that someone was dead."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo. She previously worked as a senior assistant to the Newark Police Director.
The investigation is currently underway to determine whether the death was caused by an unlicensed intervention by a non-identified cosmetic surgeon working under West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya’s death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which caused her to suffer with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has worked as an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and reliable," McCarthy Arroyo said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
". He was my hairdresser.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of former Newark policeman Jimmy Arroyo, who currently works for the Sesame Products Control Committee, and left behind two, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old boy, and an orphan.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were working to find out if Ms. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's intervention.
"It's very likely," Walsh said.
"The investigation is still underway."
Reports from the authorities show that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. November
21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
They've already been declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and the police have so far told very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about whether Castro had been interrogated by the investigators.
Participants in the study investigated whether part of the house functioned as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro’s home, where a cooled rose bush was standing in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian was screaming from behind the house.
Next to the door leading into the cellar, there was a blue tank in the driveway with the inscription "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in foods and perfumes.
Inverted from camps on two mountain bikes hanging side.
McCarthy recalled that when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo gave her invaluable help by helping to shape the new city’s unusual and unbridled political culture.
“He always said, ‘It’s better to take care of this and that!’” he recalled.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always inside when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations of the Fed’s interest rate cuts lead to a slump in the world’s stock markets
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean plummeted yesterday after U.S. Vice President of the Central Bank of America's reassuring remarks heightened hopes that the Fed will try to ease investment opportunities with further interest cuts.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe emerged after Donald Kohn, who was the right-hand man of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, said leaders must respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the constant unrest in the financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear goal of calming markets amid the signs of a resurgence of credit crisis, he said the current unrest “partly reverted to market developments at the end of September and October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the chances of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and businesses.
The statements were interpreted by investors as saying that the Fed is willing to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets or even further interest rate cuts in order to stabilize credit conditions.
The statements also had a reassuring effect on Wall Street, which has recently been hit by bad news about the U.S. economy, such as the negative record for U.S. housing sales.
The side effect of financial turmoil has also been confirmed by the announcement of the investment bank Bear Stearns that 650 employees and 4 employees of the global workforce in the U.S. secondary-market housing sector are being compensated as part of the cost reduction.
The measure will affect a total of 20 jobs in London, which employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average grew by 331 points, 2.55%, and closed by 13,289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
London’s FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 grew by 2.3 percent.
The unrest in the credit market resurfaced after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank, the three-month-old securities were transferred to European banks at a price of 4.7 per cent not seen since April 2001.
After the British interbank interest rate, Libor reached its highest level since September after a steady increase since November 12th, 6.59 per cent, and the Bank of England was under ever greater pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB’s lead.
In England, the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should be the English team's sixth in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first indirect test against Sri Lanka, it is no less important who makes the decision?
The latter question is relevant on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the selectors, who temporarily performs this particular task, will be assisted by head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, Morris is not responsible for the decision, and on the other hand, because Hugy is English.
Of the two players pull the shorter one, which does not get the sixth batting place, but as is known, life, and especially sports, is often unfair.
It’s never easy to tell why someone’s vocation peaks, while others can’t get over it at an even lower level. Often it’s more about your luck than your talent.
Not only is it characteristic of cricket that it is difficult to choose - often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to look at Shah if this happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example, if we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, high-skilled, well-known young leaders will be placed before the decision-makers, while only one of them has a seat.
Who can tell what level of a cricketer without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, the data has a big influence on the decision, but the options are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's gaze at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batsman must get a regular chance if he wants to become a big player once.
It is much more difficult to capture the view of the selectors.
James Anderson, for example, has played better last season, but he still counts as a confident team member on the first test, despite Stephen Harmison’s own saying that he’s in good shape and he’s doing very well.
Anderson fought 32 first-class goals with a knockout and 33 runs to take part in the tour.
Chris Tremlett has only hit 29, but both of them have already had successful moments at the highest level and hopefully they will be in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can boost or disrupt anyone’s career, but it may not have any special impact for the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played all the tests and performed well with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who emerged at the time, who became an outstanding and decisive test cricketer, who may have been underestimated by the fact that he is still underestimated today.
It is likely that in the Asgiriya Stanion, during today’s game, they will turn their voices against Bopara’s youthful vitality and dynamism by listening to their conservative perceptions of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores.
There are arguments for both of them.
In addition to Shah, he made his brilliant and successful debut in the Bombay 88 Test quarters, which was seven years younger than his six-year-old Bopara, who also scored 32 first-class centenarians in outstanding spins.
But the fact that the Middlesex player Shah at home in May, the test in the Lorda against the West Indies ran only ten in two quarters, and the fact that Vaughan, who fought for him again in the next game, was in a fight for him against the referees in an instant.
Against him, Essex’s universal talent is a life-threatening and unrivalled player.
There’s nothing to be upset about on the cricket ground, but he was well-characterized by his off-track behavior when he was slammed at an exhibition with a four-wheeler by the team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
However, the first thing he did after that was to grab Vodafone's (naturally sponsored) phone and call his remote-watching teammate, Alastair Cook, "Do you have this to tell him?"
Bopara is a better track player with classics. With his sliding middle steps, he develops an advantageous pitch, and his beats are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe this is the real art of choice.
I'd personally give Bopara a chance now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would stand out if, as the tea leaves in Ceylon suggest, he'd be the one to play on the weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by buses to work and pick up the fight with Al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses have arrived from Syria to Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have either lost their money or have expired their visas, or are, in fact, those who hope that the city has regained order.
There are some among them who have returned to take up the fight with the soldiers who have driven them out of their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people arriving from Damascus, filling dozens of buses, arrived.
“I then decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Dr Sabah al-Qubaisi.
“Today I came back because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to the militia priest Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently stopping his Shia army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from Amariyah, mostly Sunni, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up work.
Neighbors of Amariah’s shill called him and urged him to return home, saying he managed to clear Al Qaeda out of their stronghold in the western part of the capital with the help of US-backed troops.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, after he began encouraging his compatriots to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they need my support and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken about the fact that since the US troops were involved in the capital, peace has been strengthened and they have been seduced home by armed civilian forces working with the Americans.
But more and more were forced to return from Damascus due to visa and material problems.
The 51-year-old three-child Salaam al-Samarrai has given a voice to the widespread view among refugees that Shia Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has asked the Syrian government to reject the refugee visa application if it is forced to do so.
It is believed that more than two and a half million have fled the death brigades operating in the country.
"Everything was fine until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and pressured the government not to issue any more visas to Iraqis in order for them to move home," he said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I ran away."
One reason for the alleviation of the violence is that the Sunnis were expelled from the ski areas, while the skis also left the Sunni residential areas. As a result, tensions in many areas decreased.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will again intimidate the prospects, which may even lead to further fighting.
Small Saarland - well-trained
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in the field of vocational training, in addition to its higher education with an international orientation.
In only one area of training, the saar regions are struggling with the same shortcomings as the rest of the country.
“Yesterday, I explained to those outside the Saar region fifty times that we are not French,” the posters of the pre-Ironic slogan marking the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saar region, which, according to the surveys of the German Institute of Economics (IW) in Cologne, can boast of the fifth instalment.
In this way, the institutions of higher education - already only because of the traditions - cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students here can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
The proportion of foreign students is therefore high at 15.6 per cent.
However, colleges and universities in the Saarland region also have an above-average attractiveness for those who want to study in the Saarland region – many of them do not have a high school degree.
“In the Saar region, opportunities for vocational training are being exploited,” explains Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than one-fifth of young people are eligible for further education at a vocational school, making the Saar region more than seven percent higher than the federal average.
The combination of vocational and higher education is also well-designed.
The dual-study infrastructure is the second largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has declined by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the Saarland therefore committed the higher education institutions to a marketing trip, which is the focus of the engineering sciences.
“We initiated a number of reforms in the general schools following the first Pisa study,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of high school is free of charge. This is a model that, in the meantime, other federal provinces have also begun to copy.
Whether the performance of the students will continue to improve will only be answered by comparative studies in the future.
According to the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students affected by the risk decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saar region did not improve to the same extent as the other federal provinces.
Bajorans count better.
The greatest resentment of the island regions during the Pisa survey is not taken into account by the knowledge of a foreign language - otherwise, it would otherwise be possible to breed beavers in this area,
since the language of neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in high schools - even if the saar-regions are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is changing the clock
In the near future, the hours in Venezuela will be different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will roll back the timers in the Latin American country in half an hour.
Meanwhile, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez has become a laughing stock in Spain.
According to Venezuela’s official newspaper, the clocks are rotated by four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time under a new law.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
U.S. anti-Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, among other things, justified the decision that the U.S. forced all-hour-based time zones into the world.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with neighboring Colombia would be discontinued due to a hostage.
The left-wing nationalist politician has stated that while the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain contact with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this because of my own dignity,” said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the country must formulate an opinion in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, it would significantly build power in the country.
The main reason for the debate was Uribe’s decision to revoke Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe, with his decision, "bought arcul" Venezuela, voiced criticism of Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone talks about Chavez.
In the country, a new mobile ringtone has made an appearance: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), - that's the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the internet.
The phrase comes from John Charles, King of Spain, who was so upset at the last Latin American summit by the constant interlocutors of the left-wing populist politician that he cut into his word.
Wage cuts threaten Germans in 2007
According to a forecast, real wage cuts are threatening German workers this year despite the strong economy.
Experts have backed their pessimistic predictions for a number of reasons.
According to calculations by the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, in 2007 employees could actually pay less than in the previous year.
"This modest wage development, the increase in the general turnover tax, and the rapid rise in food and energy prices are the reason," Gustav Horn, a fellow at the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research, told Bild.
Unemployment insurance may also be subject to additional burdens on workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said in a statement to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that in the current situation, the reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labor Agency should not be put in a situation so difficult as to apply to the Federation for credit or support, the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician, has been quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the devastation of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is the devil's twin brother on Earth.
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than previously assumed: In the atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" spacecraft discovered lightning, and in its angular circles, it discovered lightning bolts such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is blinking.
The European "Venus Express" space probe provided evidence - it discovered electromagnetic waves on the periphery of the atmosphere: The lightning strikes on Venus spread from cloud to cloud at a height of around 56 kilometers, according to the scientific journal "Nature" in California.
According to the famous "soap theory" the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, the zivatids initiated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it could have been in very early times,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently, there can be hardly any living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is around a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin brother, but it's still his twin brother," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, in mass and size, is so similar to Earth, is on a completely different path of development.
The launch of the "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of Venus, because since the beginning of the 1990s, no probe has been on its way to explore this planet.
The latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, prove not only the uniqueness of the Venusian Solar System.
“They also point out that the similarity of the neighboring planet to the Earth is greater than we first assumed,” said ESA.
In addition to the already known north-sark wind, the researchers also discovered an even faster-moving cloud swirl in the South-sark.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth’s winter hemisphere, according to a research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the Solar System has a mass almost equal to that of Earth, and a diameter of 12,100 kilometers is almost the size of Earth.
Also known as the Evening Star, the Sun orbits the Sun in just 225 days.
However, it revolves much slower around its own rope: a wedding day lasts for 243 Earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature of 460<0xC2><0xB0>C, coupled with a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists suggest that both planets originated under completely similar conditions.
Both of them gathered water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus they left for the universe.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is bound up in carbonate rocks, on Venus it makes up a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, the president of the German Republic, is calling for an end to the debate between the parties that exploded around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office of the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September reception.
German Republican President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s authority and called on the grand coalition to end the debate over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not be a divided nation on this issue to the outside world,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) accepted the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universal to me, even if I respect the difference between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the foreign-policy delicate balance, the Republican president stressed; however, he defended Merkel against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not broken the traditional 'one China' policy.
China is aware of this too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly gave voice to the Dalai Lama’s refusal to accept it and thus became the target of attacks in the EU’s ranks.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "crime policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office of the Chancellery, there were severe disturbances in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only rejected the invitation of German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to accept the Dalai Lama.
China has denied that if European politicians accept the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity, the Chinese position has been reinforced by Wen Jiabao.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words have pointed out that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan territories, including today’s provinces.
Schäuble protects against riots like the French
Street clashes with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against riots similar to those in France.
Every effort must be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from resulting in street violence, the German Interior Minister said.
Barricades set on fire, rendezvous officers shot at policemen with a beer gun: After the serious disturbances of young people in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives don’t build up in us and don’t get violent.
We have to take it seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people are justified in the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes have already been shown,” he said.
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban architectural and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, young people were having serious street fights with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were also set on fire.
In view of all this, the Federal Government demanded a greater degree of activity in terms of integration by Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish Communities in Germany.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
Yet, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is "higher than average".
First of all, more education should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to provide a perspective for young people."
The head of the Turkish Community, however, added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "Despite this, we must be open."
Young people "should be given the opportunity to have a job and get an education as soon as possible".
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete tranquility throughout the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to deploy, and a helicopter was grazing the area with a spotlight.
Competent authorities have reported on three arrests, as well as some burning garbage dumps and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of 1,000 people on a wheel has been providing peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after her visit to the suburbs.
During the night of the flood, 80 policemen were injured as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The storms erupted in a car accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the State Prosecutor's Office's initial findings, the police are not held responsible for the deaths of young people.
Cloud Rider in Angela's Empire
The chancellor’s action, embodied in reality, is proof that the coalition is coming to an end – and nothing is expected of it.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
After the general debate of the Bundestag, in terms of its content, it must be determined that it is not here - not in the country where it is his business to govern.
In a superficial sentence, Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
It’s provincial, he replied, and in this way he just made it clear that he doesn’t want to understand what his critics are talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, it was clear to everyone how striking the eyelashes were.
In the meantime, there was no specific interest or empathy for the country’s problems.
Instead, she appeared as Cloud Rider Angela: a reality-obsessed politician who flees to foreign policy and there is only uncertainty of his own.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendammi is always praising itself for the Boundaries, but listening to how climate goals should be achieved in the country.
At all, as far as the self-determination is concerned - the CDU president would not have allowed such a degree of unhappiness two years earlier.
Now he clings to the phrase that prosperity has had a positive effect on people.

During the debate over the Republican presidential nominees on YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard-fought switch - and now they must also keep it from an outside candidate.
The tensions of the candidates have already surfaced on the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, of turning New York into a “rescue of illegal immigrants.”
He who, for his part, contrasts with the serious facts, “I would say that his own house served as an asylum for illegal immigrants,” cuts back Giuliani, and stabs him in the eye of the former governor of Massachusetts, who employs immigrants without papers as a private man.
The nominees are on the brink: As the Republican camp still lacks a unanimously backed favorite, the eight-presidential pro-choice debate on CNN is primarily used to undermine his opponent’s credit.
The 30-second videos uploaded by Internet users through YouTube are just about as much as short summaries.
“We have brought Hitler to power with this kind of isolationism,” says John McCain, under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only participant in the circle demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by Vietnam's veteran when he refuses to condemn so-called "Waterboarding" as torture, the interrogation method in which water immersion is simulated.
The fact that the campaign’s important themes, meanwhile, are just beyond the debates in Iraq and the tortures, is demonstrated by the reactions of the St. Petersburg audience in Florida.
A loud tap breaks out in the hall when praise for conservative values and rejection of future tax increases.
In the meantime, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney says, regretfully, and apologises to supporters and television viewers for making her voice heard in 1994, even after her pregnancy was interrupted.
Giuliani, on the other hand, hesitates when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first to rule as a civilian
A day after the resignation of the army, the resignation of President Musharraf, who is in power in Pakistan, took place.
With this, eight years of military rule will end in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf will be suspended for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live from the capital, the Presidential Palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to the Constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over the office of military chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus let go of international pressure coming from the United States.
The former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state after eight years without bloodshed in the form of a military coup.
With Musharraf’s resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the West and the opposition have complied with a fundamental demand.
Another important demand is the abolition of the state of emergency announced by Musharraf on November 3.
Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would end the state of emergency in which he meets another demand from the West after his resentment.
The country’s Supreme Court, to which Musharraf planted lawyers sympathizing with him in early November following the announcement of his state of emergency, last week rejected any objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an assassination attempt on a military convoy in a tribal territory located in the north of northern Azerbaijan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The fathers of Blutrock are back.
The German supergroup of the 1970s re-musiced: The three band members of Harmonia re-entered their instruments until the power of a Berlin concert.
On the occasion of the re-enactment of their light age, from the time of "Live 1974", a cut recording appears.
At the time, they were much more familiar abroad.
The reported sensation takes the body in the person of the three agreed gentlemen surrounding the dinner table.
Each has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle of his 63th birthday in a snow-white ing.
Michael Rother, a 57-year-old left-hander, has a laptop and a guitar.
From the right side of the audience, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, turns around and concentrates on the console.
Each of them produces some noise, while at the same time a rhythm.
And all of this sometimes coincides with some sort of traditional music.
However, all this does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves in particular.
It was a great excitement for the fans of the krautrock musical direction that the Harmonia band was returning to music.
What we can already tell you here: As a result of an appropriate follow-up, we can find that the name echoed in the collective pop memory, but in no case left any lasting traces that we miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why not celebrate the living legends of the Germans in their 70s?
Particularly because what is misleadingly called krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award to the living members of the Cologne Can band in 2003, the German pop figures sat in the hall with a meaningless face.
When even the Red Hot Chili Peppers praised La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their laudation, the admiration became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat down as an old buddy with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is already overloaded by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years, and during this time it had a much smaller impact than what others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising Cluster name.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company financed by the church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time gained a reputation as the guitarist of the perhaps most radical German band at the time, Neu!.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster music to their exile in the Weserbergland Forst.
There they lived in Alter Weserhof, a 16th-century Rome, as a fugitive commune.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are rather idyllic.
The flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein song was supposedly drawn from the rubbish and thus found a name for their art.
Some of these things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is titled "Musik von Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Despite the loose and modest music, the band suffered a material need.
The collection of roses alone did not ensure the discovery of themselves.
The CD, titled "Live 1974", was recorded at a concert held in Griessem, in front of an audience of less than 50 people, as someone remembers.
The coercion and occasional practice of Harmony was Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral claim.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother performed at the esoterics and retained himself from albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The griessemi live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company, Greenland, set out to take care of krautrock as a special German addition to his live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been promoted in the same way as Roedelius’ solo work.
The Resurrection of Harmony takes place at the House of Cultures in Berlin.
From cash, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
Also present is Loveparade's idea manager, Dr. Motte.
All this roughly outlines the effect of Krautrock on the ensuing pop era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the vacant space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's finding floats along with the most unusual sounds in the room: "The only true music, his future."
There are pictures that depict the producer with Harmonia in the room of a farmhouse.
Drawing additional black-and-white photographs of equipment made with cables serves the construction of the legend.
In the foreground, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
That’s all they do to record microphones for the organ and drum equipment with the intention of tricking out sound effects that they’ve never heard from the instruments themselves using instruments that they’ve escalated to produce sound effects.

Krutrock has always been a very English concept.
He was never talking about rock.
The roots were less sought after in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here yells "68!", he is not on a completely wrong path, and Harmonia does not allow himself to be shaken out of his tranquillity even now.
Even the most understandable thing of its own is thoroughly reconsidered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can be nerve-wracking, or you can face the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
Through "The Hunt" and "Mörderischer Frieden", there are two films about the Balkan Wars.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either overly focused on action and shooting, or overly emotional.
Not even Richard Gere himself can help with the Hunt.
First of all, the good news is that while the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is there, in the dark back of the Bosnian war, that the actor, Richard Gere, was found again.
We have recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because the many good-boy-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no
And here, all of a sudden, Richard Gere's most oppressive argument is that maybe we should watch the movie "The Hunt."
It offers a wonderful, smiling transformation: Basically, the military lecturer Simon Hunt formed by him is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn’t been so generous with him: A man who has long left his most beautiful years as a memorable part of myself.
However, the film "The Hunt" and also the German production of "Mörderischer Frieden" that began to be screened this week, despite this audacity, continues only an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love.
While it is to be welcomed that this time the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evils, the film with the flattery of television films is too quickly lost in shooting and eventful scenes.
It carries the character "Cobra 11" - with a war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, in the case of "The Hunt", one can examine for example why not even a really good film about the Balkan War was made.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are set to investigate the Serbian war criminal, who listens to the name "R<0xC3><0xB3>ka", with other directors, other screenwriters (both in Richard Shepard's personal union), may be a new "California" at a different age.
For the stories show a surprising similarity: in both cases, small groups cut him off into the forest to carry out what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the drive to madness turns.
One of the reasons for the fall of "The Hunt" is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt be the deafening cynical listener in his heart, as he introduces him at the beginning.
No, and in addition, in the script, he also spent a romantic relationship with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunt" finally slips away when reporters reach what NATO, the CIA, and all the world's hunters have not been able to do in the last five minutes of the film: They will be able to capture a war criminal and hand him over.
This is so bad that one would most gladly turn to the Hague International Court of Justice for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still on the loose, and suspects the Americans and the French (which are supposedly still exceptionally unified) that they are not pursuing intensely enough because of their secret political plots.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar to each other that a man comes to mind a famous Brecht verse.
In this poem, the poet writes of the famasque depicting the Asian demon on the desk: "I gaze at the cradle of the annoying heresy, which tells us how tiring it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunt" have the same oversized, human-headed masks that, however, show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan War.
It was recently reported in the newspaper that all of the Hollywood movies about Iraq were a nasty failure.
We can add that there hasn’t been a single good movie about South Africa.
It’s almost always true: If a star wanders through the world’s crisis scenes or mines, it’s something like “On the Paths of Freedom” with Patricia Arquette, “Without Borders” with Angelina Jolie, or “Blood Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in terms of time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Schindler's List".
There are probably still some films to be made, since the Vietnam War, which is now considered a classic, such as "The Bullfighter," "Apocalypse Now," or "Full Metal Jacket," was not celebrated as a single masterpiece at the time.
But it’s conceivable that nowadays, when all of the mass murders come into our homes in real time, right through two screens, we just know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And this deprives the screenwriters of ignoring the reality that would be needed to tell good stories.
After all, “To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” did so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do good if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we should get into the sarcastically distant artistic vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between the Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re Lexicon and the Balkan War, he replied, "It just depends on the fact that certain things never change.
The big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beusto has been vehemently criticized for resigning from the Olympics.
The delimitation of the mayor from his bid for the Hamburg Summer Olympics has sparked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue to fight for the aquatic games.
However, Von Beust strongly warns of the realities during the interpretation of the odds.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday called the resignation "unfavourable to the economic environment."
No other project has recently liberated such powerful motivating forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we would not be able to keep the sport’s political momentum evenly.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to devise a long-term initiative that "starts from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust has insisted that his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
Referring to the Sport Federation’s decision to apply for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Munich at the beginning of December.
“To give us this preference means that we won’t have any realistic chances in the period we have come up with until 2028.”
However, we will not give up the dream permanently, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) expressed its regrets over von Beust's remarks.
This makes the impression that Hamburg does not intend to host the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to hide an opportunity by burying our plans now,” HSB president Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The resignation from the application is also contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception at the General Meeting of the German College Sports Association.
There, Von Beust’s bid for the 2015 University of Hamburg was characterized by the fact that it did not serve as a supplement to the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association only last week started Hamburg as a city participating in the competition.
The SPD’s civic faction told the Senate that it had left valuable time unused for the construction of the apartment in Hamburg.
"Kleiner Grasbrook's development has been hampering the Senate for years because it voted for the Olympics and neglected housing," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said in a statement.
While the SPD has consistently broken its lattice with regards to Kleiner Grasbrook in favor of an integrated plan for Olympic and later residential utilization, the CDU unilaterally placed the emphasis on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked a lot of enthusiasm at the time in Hamburg.
However, it collapsed in Hamburg.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects Sweden and wall concepts with each other is Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Is that so?
At present, the wall facades produced in Sweden are putting a dark shadow on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box listed here is forged.
After a few months in the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" in which Andy Warhol questioned the originality of his 1968 Brillo Boxes, now the internal investigation of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has reached a disastrous result: "Bott<0xC3><0xAD>n, Boll<0xC3><0xAD>n is a former director of museums, and Boll<0xC3><0xAD>n is a former director of museums.
The prehistory is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial performances.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxes" in New York in 1964 - painted wall murals based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" soapbox.
Hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were exhibited at an exhibition held at the Moderna Museet in 1968 with the consent of Warhol: These (for cost-saving reasons) were not from Warhol, but were transported directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about artworks, but about their templates, simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to manufacture some Brillo bricks in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Eyewitnesses of the age are now talking about fifteen boxes that were rightly included in the art and auction history under the label "Stockholm-type" as certified Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box at the time.
Some of them were auctioned off for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hulten, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that around one hundred walls were manufactured and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol left behind.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the museum’s main monument manager at Moderna Museet, also examined three Swedish-owned boxes next to the six Brillo Boxes, two of which were produced in Stockholm in 1968: the printed cutting sheets were discussed, and these were laid down for the first time.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, is that the paint was put directly on the cutting board with a paint wheel, without foundation - and it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not certified by the artist, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "Unless you have a different version of the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in your New York series, you will have a different version of the Mu Moderna.
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it had raised “serious charges” over soapboxes.
Since then, however, they have been covering up for an irrevocable silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
The rebels in the Philippines were surrendered by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the defeat of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can’t take responsibility for the bloodshed, their hotel manager, Antonio Trillanes, told reporters, accusing the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to this, the hotel was smashed by government soldiers introducing tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers have been barricading themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly dissolve the wheel with 30 sympathies.
The military police tasked with guarding the man apparently approached him and joined the banditry.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the defeat of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have closed the outskirts of the prominent hotel.
The President called on the Security Council to hold an extraordinary meeting.
Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales has condemned the soldiers' actions.
"They've got the people," Trillanes said.
"We're calling on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was previously commander of the Scout Rangers, said that other units of the army wanted to join the march within a short time.
Critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
The government has been covered up in corruption charges for months.
In 2003, the financial district of Manila was the main scene of an attempt by 200 members of the army to chant against Arroyo.
The insurgency nearly drowned in failure after 24 hours, when the army hesitated to join.
Since 1986, at least seven coup attempts have been carried out in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
The United Internet will be great at Versatel
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in the Versatel telecommunications company.
As the company announced on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
This represents a 20.05 per cent shareholding.
There have been speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of raising the property acquired in Versatel will remain open.
With this step, the German DSL market will be consolidated, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, there were speculations about a possible switch-on, after Berenberg Bank increased its existing share in the Düsseldorf network service provider by an additional 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution retains the stake only for a third party, reported in the money market.
The previous day, the United Internet already held a narrow 10 percent share of the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has invested 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares of this stock for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies initiated a dialogue on the cooperation on the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a spokesperson for United-Internet.
The two companies jointly established the MSP Joint Undertaking in order to acquire the competitor Freenet.
The two companies are initially satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not have the right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies are leaving every opportunity open, especially in view of the increase in the share acquired in Freenet AG, the news says.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
Freenet has been around for months and is now only a case-by-case poker game that is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and wired access customers.
United Internet and Drillisch, the holding company, had a 6.01 percent stake in Freenet so far.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in an additional round of four percent.
An agreement was reached in August on the right to acquire 18.49 percent of Vatas Investment Company.
