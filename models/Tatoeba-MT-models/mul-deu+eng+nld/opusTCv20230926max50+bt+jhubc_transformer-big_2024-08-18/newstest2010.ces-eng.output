Barack Obama to be the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The US$1.4 million diploma, medal and check will be awarded, among other things, for outstanding efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief arrives in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will have a busy day.
He first attends the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with five members of the committee, which elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony at which Obama will take the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan War when he receives the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue, because he realizes that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, he stepped up his war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which he will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The President’s busy program will then be introduced to the banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian King and Queen, there will also be the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests.
From the very beginning, Obama was reluctant to pay the price.
For example, he said he felt that he did not deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just a price for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "challenge to action" for him.
Protector of Nature Accused of Extortion
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Police accused the president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Defenders of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of the appeal demanded money from investors for his benefit, Lithuanian police spokeswoman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The chairman of the Lithuanian Society of Nature Conservators is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is now in prison and faces up to three years in prison.
Brno’s sorting containers don’t smell too much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort the packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will meet the sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes before you find the right ashtray.
I don’t want to say that there is no waste at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, councillors are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the forefront of waste sorting not only by the fact that, as citizens here, we can still throw in sorting containers only paper, glass and plastics, but above all by the number of ashtrays on such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle into a shopping cart in the center?
It's a ready-made compost, especially it takes time and firm nerves.
The only place I've met so far is in Moravske plein opposite Potrefene Huse.
Don't let Mr. Underka get mad at me and my colleagues, but I don't give a damn about it.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
Many of my friends don't like to waste.
With laziness.
They have it a long way from ashtrays.
I'm not surprised.
After the party, I offered to throw away a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored ashtrays on Kounic's street in sight.
Luckily, I came to the right place on the way to the shalin.
However, the waste flowed from it.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which probably represents the city the most, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't interest the Brunei socialists very much.
Those in the city would rather buy a hockey extraliga that would embarrass us all over the republic than buy a few more containers and offer to classify other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a moment of browsing the internet with official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
"Paroubk's" budget took money for pensions and sick
After the left has added, despite the government’s views on farmers or officials, there may not be any money on pensions, sickness, or construction savings in the budget.
But also on interest on state debt or on international judicial disputes.
It will allocate problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists pushed for an increase to some groups, they relied on the government to borrow additionally on sensitive expenses, pensions, or sickness. "It's just putting problems into the future, putting mine," says Janota.
The borrowed money pays higher and higher interest rates, and sometimes it has to come back.
There is not much to choose from, the state has no choice.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all that the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or medical bills that have gone out of their account for 1.8 billion, they will get them.
But at the cost of borrowing more – next year it will not be missing just 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce parental income, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Due to money transfers in favour of several groups of voters, next year will also be missing five billion for the construction of highways and railways.
These are mostly already contested and dismantled sections, which cannot be redesigned and possibly discounted.
At the highest, which is also not free.
This means the delay or stoppage of 30 large buildings, and the withdrawal of European money is also at risk, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka warns.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed that the loss of money will solve the shalamounsky – it will reach the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state owns, and from them the transport fund contributes.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer an endless source at all.
Last year, there were 18 billion in the budget.
Every year, the dividend pays for the elimination of environmental damage, supplements the pension account or serves as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick under EU rules raises the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival does not end.
Nearly three billion were spent on the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime or on expenses for litigation, even for construction savings.
If it happens without this money, it is not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, to reach the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing from the already-launched two-billion-dollar Treasury project, which is to allow online monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will be able to handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
The unveiling of the plans sounds promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android within seconds.
This is exactly what the US company VMware aims to do, which focuses primarily on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to keep two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was introduced for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has successfully presented a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran alongside each other.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test the virtualization of smartphones, and the devices are expected to reach customers by 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Blank slopes don't just worry about crocodiles.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains, you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors to our website.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but for now they are afraid to order.
And if they call us, they will immediately ask if we think Christmas will be on snow or mud this year," said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
Those who want a New Year’s Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly as they imagined should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers saving money and the quality of accommodation is only in second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
For the time being, hoteliers in Spindleruv are offering mostly only weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to get married for a while, but then they'll let them go and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will quickly decline," Jandura estimated.
Free bed in all winter dates is still offered by the Vrchlabian travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
Half of the places on our offer are still available.
That’s why we’ve already made some cheap Christmas stays at the last minute,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains can be offered by the Vrchlab travel agency as well, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days of February are also well-received, with the remaining winter dates being sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy in a week, Christmas will be sold out,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, a little better than last year, the rooms of Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou can be occupied.
We're about five percent better at it.
We have the last few places on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it is also well sold in February," said Karel Rada, director of the best bakery hotel.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are held by the Omnia hotel near the central parking lot in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the newest Janskolazenské hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we already have about sixty percent at this time.
February is a bit weaker so far, but as soon as the snow strikes, interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will surely rise, said Omnia Hotel Director Erik Sporysch.
However, for a larger chunk of snow, the hoteliers in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e region have to let the taste go.
On Thursday, it is supposed to cool, if there are any rains, then there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming should come again, informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the castle workshop of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It’s only comical how schoolboy Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be the stupidest.
When he finally encapsulated his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it through a copy of Bush’s Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the wording "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate even to use the name of Bush's January 2007 declaration as the name of his own declaration: "The New Way forward".
Three years ago, he criticised Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq plagued by a civil war as “irresponsible and in its consequences catastrophic decisions.”
But the months that followed showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only one that was so successful and so successful that today there is no talk of Iraq at all in the intelligence reports.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, but he objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked to increase his military contingent by field commanders, especially Afghan Operation Commander General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the hesitant gunmen in the White House despite subordinate customs.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't get any better, so at least he smashed the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to keep the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he initially counted at least 10.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start pulling troops out of Afghanistan in 18 months and end the process in three years, and the entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than provides answers.
Many doubt that a half-increase will bear the same fruit as the process in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are being observed.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are ill-prepared, accustomed to changing the master every day according to how it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a post-Mohammed village, after which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to thrive.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is unusually complex given the opaqueness of the conditions, which further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Nor does the construction of a “accessible state”, which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is filled with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent to the turret for the purpose of "short return home" will cause the miracle done here, only the soul can truly romantic, untouched reality.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that Europeans’ willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is at a disadvantage.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of Hindukusha.
Another factor capable of radically interfering with the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the sanctions on Iran do not affect it, the United States will be faced with an overburdened question of not trying to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered right at a time when, according to Obama, America is stepping up to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only placard for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers No Longer Received Cash Rewards
The senior executives of Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which thus reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 top managers will receive instead of money shares that can be sold as soon as five years from now.
In addition, stocks can be taken away from managers if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction in which it needs to go, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after giving away nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) in rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the company’s total salary for this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High salaries in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries with the advent of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-time 50% tax on bankers bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (about CZK 712,000).
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record five women today in Stockholm have taken over this year’s Nobel Prize in literature and professional categories from the hands of Swedish King Charles XVI.
In addition to the four scientists among them was the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, were awarded the Nobel Prize for their research into chromosomes.
Israel’s Ada Jonathova, along with the Americans Venkatram Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the Chemistry Award for clarification of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last winner was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was won by American economist Elinor Ostromov<0xC3><0xA1> and her countryman Oliver Williamson for his analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and Willard Boyle took the award for their research in optical fibers and George Smith for their invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes, or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel Prize, and a certificate of financial rewards.
That for each category amounts to ten million Swedish kroner (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more awarded in each of them, the reward is shared among them.
The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway, this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his award, since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the forefront of a country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In defense of his policy, however, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to fight for peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will welcome Finance Minister Eduard Janot on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget, and perhaps Janot's stay in the cabinet, will be the themes of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
In his view, the deficit is too high, which further exacerbates the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the President's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his next term in office.
Under the budget law, which will now get Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
However, the House on Wednesday approved the Left’s proposals for money transfers and increased money on salaries of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government insisted on the proposals of social democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
There was a sharp internal political dispute between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which led to a question mark on the next action of Fischer's official cabinet, on which the <0xC4><0x8C>nale and DSD were formed in the spring.
Critics say the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially liquidating a package of austerity measures that Fischer’s government put in place in the fall and which it says is intended to stop government debt.
Klaus, who may, but also may not, sign the state budget law, said at a discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected a "serious problem" that is a "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn’t think there’s a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government, which could rely on the broader consensus of the political parties, could make improvements, the president said.
ODS President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as "strong phrases".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD chief Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek responded to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka by saying that the budget deficit, which the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nko government has prepared for this year, is terrifying and will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD marked the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The people were also happy with it.
Mandela played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories despite some critics portraying the lead roles by American actors.
The story tells the story of sport, race, and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that the 29-year-old Mandela asked him if he could play him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I said to him, 'If I'm going to play you, I'm going to have to have access to you.
The twenty-seven-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood’s drama from the setting of the boxing Million Dollar Baby, has already recreated, for example, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who eventually became a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, and even a divinity of God in the Divine Eve.
A former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and served as the country’s president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for undefeated and is the title of an English poem by William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected president of Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the players of rugby who belong on a global scale among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on canvas.
“I had no other goal but to play this role so as to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I press your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know how you feel, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing a home bell, he opened it to me, and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual performances under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated gained positive reviews and the Oscar ambitions are also talked about.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his rating in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76% positive reviews.
The secret of the light over Norway unraveled: the Russians tested the missile
It was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin above Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was again unsuccessful, and the missile designated as the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the Russian army's hub, is slowly becoming a black nightmare for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the tests of the missile did not have a suitable effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, the vessel did not take off or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, Bulava is already referred to as a “missile that does not fly”.
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This was the 13th attempt in the series to start off normally.
At the end of the flight, there was a technical damage to the aircraft.
Apparently, a third-degree rocket engine exploded.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which floated below the level of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows fire from a ship that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is probable that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a nearer-determined flying object was indeed disrupted by the "Bulva".
From the very first moment, the Norwegians did not doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time and argue that one cannot speak clearly of failure.
The first two missiles survived and the accident reached the third one.
In the previous cases, the engines immediately collapsed in the first stage.
Although not a single test run has taken place without a mistake, only six out of thirteen are considered unsuccessful by the leadership of the Ministry of Defense.
Almost fifty percent of the general's success is therefore filled with optimism, and so he still claims that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it even hijacks up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year contract at CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vja<0xC4><0x8D>eslav Fetisov will be presented again in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
Former world champion, Olympic winner and holder of the Stanley Cup will help his CSKA Moscow team in the emergency and will appear to be in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1> got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We just need to settle some formal matters, cited AP coach of the Moscow club Sergey Nemchinov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will involve only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players, he said.
Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional hockey player in the event of a return to ice.
In the NHL, he played for 15-year-old Hartford striker Gordie Howe for the entire season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Champion titles, triumphing in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also achieved success in the NHL, where in a Detroit shirt he twice lifted the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has met the trade unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of the carmaker Hyundai has agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the often ordered overtime that the trade unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai car spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, which is essential, which is why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two changes being made, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who work the Saturday exchange offered a bonus of CZK 400.
They will also receive it back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way of motivating employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they are allowed to pay an overtime surcharge or they can opt for a replacement holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid rides and lunches.
Since overtime was the most juridical and inflammatory point in terms of the remarks and complaints of trade unionists, as well as protesting employees, who stopped production last week vigorously, the leadership of the workers last month decided to reschedule yesterday afternoon with immediate effect.
The employees of the car company were forced to work another two-hour overtime almost every day until last week after an eight-hour shift.
After the signing of the agreement, the trade unions cancel the strike emergency
The next meeting between the automaker and the trade unions is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The head of trade unions Petr Kochar said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike readiness.
The car situation escalated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were on a spontaneous strike because of the constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged harassment.
The management warned that overtimes must be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
The unions also demanded that workers who stopped production last Wednesday should not be affected by any sanctions in their strike-emergency announcement on Monday.
In the field of overtime, trade unions after the company require it to minimize overtime work.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 kroner for it this year.
Hyundai No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice now employs 2,000 people.
The company started mass production last November.
As of September this year, it has produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also occupies 'deadly' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also absorbs viruses that have already acquired anti-drug immunity.
In some cases, this fact outweighs the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the reproduction of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral reproduction also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that a substance called metallocarboran acts on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘enhanced’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are connected by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resilient virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the splitting of the HIV virus, mature infectious viral particles would not have formed.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease agents was tested in the tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on a common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically-administered drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications thus metalocarbons make interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of biological drugs against HIV. <0xC3><0x9A>k<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC3><0x9A>k<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xAD>n <0xC3><0x9A>k<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC3><0x9A>k<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xA1>r
A dispute over the budget. The ODS went to Fischer, he defended
ODS chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek called the approved budget for next year "terrible" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence, he said.
The ODS statement was labelled by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He says he has time for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in the House, which is about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out.
The House on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House increased money on salaries of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s appeal to the social democracy proposals was that they were secretly raising the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
Before the vote, the ODS left the room, meeting the wishes of the government so much that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisorium.
Disappointment and Ignorance
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of emptiness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will evaluate the current situation.
Time is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to step down in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could have been different.
According to Czech Television, Janota ordered to the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering further resumption of office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget.
If Fischer speaks out for a further fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>ase in the government, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD nominees have nothing to do, which has pushed for changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or a service bill.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated for ODS did not join
It is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in the post office who are applying to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Sometime he stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the principle of combating the high deficit of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
Then he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I haven’t thought about it, and when it’s up to date, I’ll focus on it,” Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, the defense minister, told reporters in the House of Commons.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a European Council meeting.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS withdrew
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would apparently vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the prime minister had not explicitly asked the member of the civil democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not look like orphans, we are not small children, then he replied to the question whether the ODS did not make the absence of the president of the party in Parliament and the Czech Republic difficult in the political negotiation of the budget.
I didn’t realize that my voice was missing.
Already when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the months to come it will be mainly about the Bolsheviks of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself responded.
According to the new <0xC4><0x8C>D regulation, fewer trains will travel on almost the same journey
Czech railways will cancel or limit some of the less burdened speeds and locals from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total range of transport will be reduced by two per cent from the date of entry into force of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including the basic and customer fare, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava have more options for connecting to the capital, and the tracks on this route add one set of pendulums.
On the other hand, the ambulance stops driving to Bratislava.
Less speeds will also be available on the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, basically the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be limited.
From the regions, the tracks are planning the largest reduction of transport in the Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> region, a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy the increase.
Two night trains are also interrupted on the route Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and the operation of several high-speed trains on the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice have to move to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovic.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Praha Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC3><0xAD>.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce several SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will travel at two-hour intervals.
The pendoline to Bratislava will no longer connect passengers from 13 December.
This year’s regional rail account: 200 million more
The rapids are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total to compensate for the so-called demonstrable loss, will give the loved ones four billion kroner next year, as well as this year. Locals order the countries, in total will pay the states eight billion kroner next year.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The tracks have a newly concluded ten-year contract on both the locals and the speedometers, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The drachmas praise the system, which is why the vast majority of tickets apparently did not increase prices.
Changes will only take place with one-day network tickets <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap internet tickets eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will be increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ky will start from a narrow distance, so far it was uniform for the trip between any regional cities and amounted to 160 kroner.
Philippine Armed Forces Still Detain Over 50 People, Children Released
Armed forces today kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The merger took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are said to be using hostages as a live shield when fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the kidnapper was initially pursued by police for violence that required settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed has been declared permanent.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections to the governor’s office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (officially Invictus: Invincible) will be released in theaters in the United States, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of world-famous anti-apartheid fighter Morgan Freeman is said to have chosen Mandela himself for his portrayal years ago.
The men's side role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was hosted by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film into cinemas, they emerge from the reviews of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was the President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the world championship in football are peaking in the South African Republic, but at the same time the media are shaken by disturbing reports of rising racial hatred and discrimination of the black population.
According to the AP news agency, the ratings for the new film in JAR are so far quite positive, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main roles of the "flying" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film, he said.
I've been dreaming about that role for years and I've been well prepared for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to – as they say – draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can film Mandela's personality and message.
It’s the story of the South African Republic, but it’s about everyone, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
The film is based on a book by British writer John Carlin entitled In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made the Nation Portrait of a South African Human Rights Advocate during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman tries to silence two racial and long-determined groups of the population during the film, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also plays the role in South African national rugby jersey on the field of the World Cup.
For the entrance to the lawn in a jersey, which is almost considered sacred in the JAR, Mandela fourteen years ago smeared a large egg mainly white audience and gained the recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in the JAR will improve will only prove itself.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent LN interview.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko, a transformer burns for tens of millions of kroner
The fire broke out in the morning by a <0xC4><0x8C>eps company transformer in a distribution centre near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsk.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, a spokesman for regional firefighters, six units intervened in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later they reassessed the view and the fire burns with a mixture of water, foam and special hash substances.
The cause was a technical malfunction, the internal shortening of the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident, according to company spokesman Pavly Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of kroner, to accurately calculate it will succeed until after the end of the fire.
According to the Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years of operation of <0xC4><0x8C>eps, nothing like this has happened, defects of this type are unique, it added.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, according to the spokesperson for the Czech Republic, Soni Holinger Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, the operation of households, authorities and companies of the transformer fire station was not affected.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 pipelines with 67 transformers converting electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system and the 4,339-kilometre long pipeline route.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a criminal report for raping three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD heytmans
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a criminal notice today for the raping of three social-democratic leaders.
Michael Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka from South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka from Pardubice Region and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from Olomouc Region.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura put it in the Twenty Minutes Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail transport in some regions.
In the end, however, all regions signed long-term treaties with the Czech Drums.
All three Hejtmans are attacking us and talking about picking our raisins, and we have offered only what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have nothing left to defend ourselves.
It’s for slander against the Student Agency, he told RadioJournal Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all countries that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of a criminal notice to be a further continuation of Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for him by his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and of my country, and to the same call of the other Heitmans.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he is investing several million kroner in advertising, which will warn of an unfavorable move by the regions.
The radio magazine said the campaign will stop after Christmas and wants to continue in it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign began in Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Railways and did not issue tenders on order of around 150 billion kroner.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ur was already threatened by a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose the bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know what he is talking about, I will not say his name, said Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura Radio Journal today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination since January has aggravated the habit.
It should be first for families free of charge and at the same time optional.
However, there are already voices that mandatory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peaks.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance companies will pay.
Experts also have a clear understanding of the vaccination process.
New Vaccinations
Free Vaccines for August Children
From January, children born last August 2 and later can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Anyone who has been vaccinated last year or before will have to pay for another vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's age.
As early as last year, a quarter of families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner for one dose and more.
Four doses are required to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between CZK 300 and CZK 450 thousand per year on vaccination doses.
However, it saves on the treatment that children would need without vaccinations.
To date, the cost of all the screening vaccinations for children has been around 500,000 a year.
The inoculated vaccine was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the cerebral palsy and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections in our country will kill up to 28 children under the age of 10, according to a survey in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, paid-to-use vaccinations of children against pneumococcal disease have been introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is vaccination mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
It will be paid by insurance companies and non-compulsory from January.
For example, the head of the civic association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> suggested that mandatory vaccinations would be better.
His association of pneumococcal vaccines promotes for a long time.
The experts at the international conference, which our association attended, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been implemented.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcals.
We are not thinking about it at this time at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors
Hana Cabrnoch, the president of the Association of Practical Pediatric Physicians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all the children were vaccinated, one might consider reducing the number of revaccinations "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease by next year more than 80 percent of new parents.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first surface vaccination of children paid by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thereby saving for further treatment, explains Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
This, however, is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies would be able to "take money out of health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for them to be insured.
It is estimated that individual pediatric practitioners will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
American Artist's Son 'Stealed in a Museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazett was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania reported that Alfonso Frank Frazett was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazett and the other man used to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81, celebrated himself with the creation of the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Mr. Frazett Jr. may have been motivated to take action by long-standing family disputes.
Mr Frazett, a 52-year-old man, made a statement before the police that he did so at his father’s direction, “to get to the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the confectionery,” the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior refused to grant any such authorization, as the agency stated.
Workers Are Preventing Planned Tax Increases
The ministers defended the tax hike and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As stated by Alistair Darling, the Torys "wasted" the opportunity to show that they are seriously considering delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor was also on fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Disagreement with regard to social security
The unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not cause and warned in advance of “problems.”
Social security is on the rise - an increase of around <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year - which has upset the business community, who said it was an employment tax, while there should be a focus on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limited to these incomes of more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY BODY PBR
Social insurance will increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation is deteriorating more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers’ bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax on small business depreciation
Reduction of tax on electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in pension allocation by 2.5%
According to an estimate by the state financial administration, some <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 income will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and some <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 income will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 income will increase by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal to halve the deficit by 2013 was "complicated decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of the people with the highest incomes.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increase and spending cuts would be a “drop in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
"They're big numbers. It'll allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he is confident that the growth of the economy should take place at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth — which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced — must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise the previous amounts.
In an opinion, he said the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - because loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
"A Missed Opportunity"
Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of the “debt crisis” of workers, labelled the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan over the next six years intolerable.
Ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how it could pay off, they added, "cynicically" postponed this decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they lost it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit more quickly and on a larger scale.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money earned by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year, not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are “built in the sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said on the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay the benefits next April - that this could lead to accusations of the chancellor in the election campaign, if the money was made difficult to obtain late.
But workers are insisting on providing special assistance if people are in great need of it and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget
Although the ministers did not disclose the details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The renowned Institute for Budgetary Studies said the chancellor’s figures indicate significant cuts in many areas, potentially in the future they include transportation, higher education, and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director Robert Chote.
“All important statements will only come after the election if we win them,” said Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to Deloitte’s account manager.
"It was a report of a suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI Investigates 'U.S. Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation into five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists in a prison in Pakistan.
The men were jailed for attacking a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, according to the BBC’s U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same man who was declared unidentified in the last month at their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to have originated in Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the other is from Yemen.
“If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were staying there,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house that belonged to one of their uncles.
He said the house had always been the center of interest of the local police and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters said, but said the United States "must work very closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that is rampant in recruitment and training".
The disappearance of these five students from a home in northern Virginia was announced by their families in late November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to an Amnesty International report.
The report describes in detail the "means of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the criticism of this report on human rights observance.
Officials have described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were incarcerated and the prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran John Leyne, now based in London, said earlier in the protests Supreme Leader Ajyatollah Ali Chomejn<0xC3><0xAD> declared certain forms of torture unauthorised and banned their execution in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent stated.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted 26-year-old computer science student Ibrahim Methari as saying he was accused of "working with the Facebook network" and protesting the election results.
"I often get hit in the face," he said in a statement.
"They smoked cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened my execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the election and tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iran’s top state officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also reported a case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice have set up committees to investigate the government’s election turmoil and reactions, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were leaked.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope has been created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the monument in Bristol into a race track for the race.
The race track in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge in front of a 100 m long ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the climbing track, but that it was really crushing.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city downstairs.
“There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talent,” he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the slopes.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.

At a time when Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minarets and generally spreading alarming reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and thought about whether more societies can integrate Muslims – and whether they don’t integrate them – from within.
Some of the readers after reading this book became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French don't like hats on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study of controversial issues that they have been distributing and employing the country for 15 years and have been for 15 years.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a wider and much more ambitious shot.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the bottom.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now care about 5 to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern him the most.
Should a Muslim enter into a marriage union in a mosque or in a town hall (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane controversial issues that are being discussed and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that the media employs.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others, well-known people, notwithstanding Tarika Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed cling to the assumption that this is the opposite of Selafi — supporters of the purist Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia — this group is small, but it affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
Adaptation, however, requires compromise on both sides.
It raises the question of how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite, which so generously defends the secular public) are really devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims are likely to have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found "the tightening of the screws of values".
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The most unfortunate prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the planet’s environment.
The limiting ice hides alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers at their awakening.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, portrays the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to conquer the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson with a daring fourteen-year-old swimmer who fought only with a pen of muskets is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming for the bodies of their recently killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo fences typically have an area a million times smaller than is the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis and are all armed with powerful attacking towels that fire their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, former editor of the New Scientist, offers a clear and uncomfortable responsibility for science in the Arctic and a compelling fleeting look at how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have answers to everything.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
That's for lack of tests.
Fridtjof Nansen’s research trails at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries indicated for the first time the movement of floating ice.
Submarines during the cold wars then mapped the moving parts as they sailed them.
Satellite exploration and a vast field of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still being done thanks to unthreatened individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the decay system within the Arctic ice, created by the melting of salt water, which melts as it freezes.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic miracles inside, it’s all doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice moves, which takes place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
6,000 Marines put wreaths on graves in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made their way from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day when he gave up hold to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
“In a few months, when we board, it could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me in order to show me respect the way I am trying.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the cemetery of veterans in several wards at a memorial service in Arlington.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a memorial service in Arlington.
Now it’s an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of the army and victims of terrorism.
Worcester is not looking for profit in this, cranes across America, which they also plant in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, at the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York City, and at the 93rd United Airlines memorial site in Shanksville.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has invested more than $150,000 in the purchase and transportation of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had made her way to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the Armed Forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Ms. Hunt said it was her way to return what makes the victim.
It’s a small way in which citizens can support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in warm fabric coats, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and cliffs.
Volunteers went to the older graves from World War I and World War II and from the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as the newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported a young pine tree to the found gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arc of bees at the top.
Near Division 60, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, it was really quiet.
The United Service Organizations devoted 1,000 crowns to decorating the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read the names, engraved in the stones, while others bent down to look at the small black and white namesakes, pressed into the wet mud where the gravestones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of their son’s grave.
She traveled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the site of the last resting place of the incendiary artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... ..my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government supplier jailed by Cuban government officials <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, officials at the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. interest section in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was detained on December 5.
Some charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms. S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to accept the prizes, but her permission was denied.
The arrest of a U.S. supplier may be a result of growing tensions between the Cuban-ruling Castro’s communist brother and the Obama administration, which have been seen as a “restraint tactic” in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report to the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a state employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used for text messaging, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must notify the government of their names.
Access to a lot of websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in a Cuban prison are behind bars for violent acts such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbenov<0xC3><0xA1>, a press officer of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Ms. Berben said she could not provide further information about the prison.
The arrests and arrests were amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open company - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American human rights group's compliance program, which recently published an unfavourable report on Cuba's freedoms in a newspaper like "Caudad Cuba," in a newspaper called "Caudad Cuba."
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all the solutions would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are heading towards a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are unraveling a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan, the report said.
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed the alleged leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of U.S. forces, saying they were plotting a raid on the internet, hoping that the case would help to disperse.
Investigators said they were searching for a gray insurgent known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovered them when one of the men posted a comment authorizing the terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to the remote region of Pakistan in the Aboriginal Tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaida commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA’s attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were deployed for several days to the eastern quarter of Sarghuda, far from the menacing mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered to be a strike force.
The reason for their expulsion was stated by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain consent to gain access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five – who remained in Pakistan and were interrogated by the FBI – highlights the critical role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, identifying who is credible.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who could be scouts.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to a special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to U.S. goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years in what it will allow them to access them because U.S. intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we try to penetrate these groups, is there no better way than to proceed according to their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much?
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate ‘action’
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded a stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Congress Center.
The protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but the police estimate that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists placed several small deposits near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of a small event in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying banners bearing the English inscription “This is not Planet B” (i.e., a secondary one) and one in Spanish, which reported “The Earth is Saying.”
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information about the unfortunate state of the country in which the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That's part of why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leaders to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be carried out, it cannot always be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the centre of Bella and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they either had masks on them or had pocket knives on them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstrations.
According to one of the uninvolved spectators, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate hornets, activists disguised as athletes and in black clothes laid several posts near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating at the buildings, he said, starting with lights, but then followed by "several big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn’t come to the attention of key officials, such as Su Weie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it is really something I don't know).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
It is seen the concentration of the broad public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: “It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
The data of the test reveals persistent racial differences.
Last week’s Federal Certificate of Achievement in Mathematics was a welcome element of the good news about Columbia County’s public education.
Although the county is far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth grade students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Center for Educational Advancement is the continuing disparities in the knowledge gained between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average outcome of white fourth graders in Columbia County over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their African-American peers have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in knowledge gained actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deflection of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average score in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 points on a scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some of the district’s education advocates said in the last week that the results, celebrated by secretaries Michelle A. Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were more widely stimulated among white students where the results were already high.
That would indicate that we have increased the sum of support for those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating for equality of education in the county.
I’m not jumping up and down because of a two or three-point split, said committee member D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee’s style of administration, Ms. Brown said reporting the test results means high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the benefits, and I respect that.
But what’s terrifying is that we didn’t devote almost any time and energy to our high school.
Mrs Rhee said the county's effort was to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of low-score students.
With this fall, for example, some teachers are trained in the application of the new curriculum of reading, Wilson's system of reading, aimed at students in upper classes of primary schools and high school students who have not been able to master the basics of reading before in their senior careers significantly.
The daily maths and the sixth-class math curriculum, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be traced to the cradle of NAEP's progress.
And I just think that we should keep working and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the class level, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others stated that the NAEP results explained the question of whether Ms. Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It’s a certain dilemma for Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Conventional Correction Procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia County.
Thus, the focus can bring political accents that are heading towards an important agenda.
But, of course, the extract also belongs to other city directors, who are trying to maintain the average ratio between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We must use the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to be provided with excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a key element of reducing the gap between the results achieved is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the county, to ensure school eligibility.
You have to get up to 200 days to push for changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed with his teacher association last year for a 185-day school year, which he sees as a "sign" to look for a larger increase next year.
To make higher education part of a better future
The bus arrived at Gettysburg College with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stood up and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracie's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
To date, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the railroad ground.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where the college made $3,8690 a year, their position was rather than frightening visitors into the excitement of potential students.
Yes, that's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wonder, really? she said thoughtfully, when they were told the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven people who visited on their three-day trip and were now completely intrigued by the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a major problem with the high number of children born in the U.S. of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from colleges or pregnant as a minor, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive secondary education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "sweet generation" of Spanish college students - notable results achieved indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and the population of Central America, arrived in the United States without graduating high school.
Their success story is important, say the researchers, because it underlines their point of way forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who have achieved higher education say they have a natural predisposition to school and an innate permanence and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Gracie and the millions of children who would like to graduate — especially if these efforts persist over time.
Considering that children come from low-income groups whose parents don’t have the experience and the ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point of the study won’t solve it, says Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a student at the University of California at the University of California.
We need to think about providing these children with a catch-up network in the preschool age in every way they can clean up their college.
The federal program that financed Graciely's train trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run track preparatory programs, starting for students from low-income groups in high schools and continuing until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than 1% have entered colleges, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies.
Notwithstanding fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get significant oil companies to rebuild their non-profit infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements were signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the reconstruction of Iraq’s oil industry, which has been hit by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies have left with a capital stake in just two out of the 10 looted fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one of them made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached a field deal that was auctioned in June.
The tight participation of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies here you have in the first place on the path of Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It will be a long time before something else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to discourage U.S. companies from a much more intense business in Iraq, which is arguably the third-largest commodity stockpile.
U.S. companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. took part in bids on more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic force, as well as a technological force, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will be compliant with its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
Al-Qaida's top planner was killed in Pakistan.
A top al-Qaida operation planner was apparently killed in a US missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghan border this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
As it turned out, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car near Miran <0xC5><0x9A>ah in North Vaziristan province on Thursday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles had been fired from an unmanned aircraft operated by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed to a white car heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with Pakistan’s civilian intelligence agency, which was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local gunmen approached the spot and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somalia was poi of death.
Somali was listed as a high-ranking al-Qaida military operations planner who led terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in retaliation around the world, said a senior official who did not want to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistan's territory.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was instructed by the al-Qaida top leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaida hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person for some Americans, but he did not in any way humiliate himself to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribes and three other top-ranking populists.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned planes has decreased from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to records from the Long War journal, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be justified in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people suspected of being informants, the website said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Kabul has resigned.
On Friday, the United Nations’ top delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said he would like to step down from his post in March and end such a turbulent period of office that has been marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eid’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a state reduction that begins in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
“We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they have confidence in the international community,” Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the part of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it’s high time to look at the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to U.N. officials, Ban has launched a search for compensation.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, the Frenchman who previously led the UN peacekeeping operation.
Eid’s position in Afghanistan was tested by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September of winning the country’s presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said that Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism regarding international intervention" during the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the U.S. High Representative to coordinate the easing of efforts by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to hire them for the Afghan mission, so he would, he says, want to strengthen their confidence that their money is being spent properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the difficult UN regulations on hiring undermine its ability to harness its ability to do so.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran over lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war-torn areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, undermined the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
“This is not a good choice for Iran,” he said in response to a soldier’s question about probable developments.
One of the things that depends on me is whether or not I have learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is indistinguishable in the war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a “package of incentives and restraints” would require “to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons” because “its inhabitants will be extraordinarily suffering” from sanctions.
According to a statement released Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in a warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it fails to fully align its nuclear program with the United Nations Committee on Energy Security and its nuclear watchdog.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During the talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to the talks on limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his stockpiles of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical emergencies.
The administration has set itself for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to get time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems that Iran has withdrawn from interim agreements – partly because of this, the expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided in views on whether to engage with the United States.
Honestly, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community is concerned, in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think it has brought the international community, the I-Terms, the Ga-Terms, the Russians and the Chinese together.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including surveillance, on December 31, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities by the world's perpetrators, and stated that it wants to "continue the talks with the sultan."
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is still high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly due to borders, property rights, and income-sharing.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to mitigate Kurdish concerns over the ongoing depression, citing the US official site when he told Massoud Barzaani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to eat more children" and "One more child means one more grave".
Then they got a lesson that when official government offices in Shanghai, alarmed by the low fertility and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn’t leave anything for the other, says Wang, a 31-year-old human resource manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously bubbling and crumbling children, affected by the so-called “small emperors,” a country that is endangering the population crisis.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before the policy came into force, according to the United Nations.
The distribution of the population, where the number of population aged 60 years and older is predicted to grow rapidly from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is larger of the rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older made up almost 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of workers in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual reassurance
As it was inserted into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever introduced under the Communist Party’s government.
Couples who violated politics faced immeasurable fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official sites have advocated a policy that has helped the country prevent the critical extraction of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in pursuing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women to undergo abortions during the second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selection diets, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been more moderate in their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally called for exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were single - and in 2007 they eased the dictation of their hardline passwords.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was single.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the regulation detailing how they would be entitled to have another child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most urban districts have not reported the change.
The city of Huinan district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a docile capture network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudged one child’s policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy with the first child.
Yes, we were spoiled for the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples state psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also single: “We were the focus of our families’ attention and everyone took care of us.
We weren’t used to providing care and we didn’t really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who is a Latvian translation company, expressed this much less covertly.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced fertility, he said, being successful means being selfish.
“Today’s 20s and 30s are looking at parents as the first days of the Czech capitalist experiment, and they don’t want this way to feed themselves,” he says.
It’s just one child who puts huge demands on parents’ time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of the gap -- "You need to reconstruct your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You need to have summaries prepared at a time when a child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle down with one child, Che says, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher standards of nutrition, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching undiscovered attitudes and mutual warming -- again focused on Friday on releasing a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the next 40 years, not in the shortest term.
The text, which can provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text inconspicuously states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This will deliver a great deal of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, the top representative of the Washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, shortens the 180-page text of the negotiations to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a “big picture.”
It outlines the framework for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively reduce their emissions to 25 to 45 percent per year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union quickly negotiated on Friday a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change — from coping with floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
On Friday, however, he said the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed during last week’s talks.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change, Todd Stern, has rejected a speech calling for a binding reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared to volunteering for major developing economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The move signalled that the Obama administration had set a tougher line against China than the Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also complained that the text is not enough to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "vile sanity" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" could lead to a state's irresponsibility to take over financially, not to a press release earlier in the week.
With the future of the economic path of the major world powers at stake, the straits have broken through both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States about fulfilling their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the world’s two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that major powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent their acquiescence by large emitters.
It’s a clear game that a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to enforce a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants have said that the best outcome of the talks will be a political agreement.
The small-island alliance, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations "caused political pressure on the entire politic process" partly because they are now united and demand action from Indians such as growing economies.
The talks sparked a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of government disputed the deal.
High-ranking officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister stepped out of planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Center for closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could outline the demands that will be judged next.
The full extent of the gathering - when 13,000 people were moving every day from and to the convention center, guitar-playing activists staged ironic views of countries they thought were not being sent by hand, and there was a handover of proposals from the hands.
Intensity is just a build-up: almost all key ministers and previously 60 heads of state were present in Copenhagen.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy at the International Conservation of Nature.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first train with a speed of 140 miles an hour pre-defined this Monday feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle-blower cut through the darkness to mark the departure of a train, which meant a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent, to St Pancras, London, and exceed the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and joined the first high-speed personal kit outside London.
He hopes the new service will possibly connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect large agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland with London.
The neglected standing waters should reduce transport times in passenger and commercial transport, and the transition from airplanes and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate traffic jams.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were allowed to gain for this vision.
But dozens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed down the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasible study, delivered its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection to West Midland was proposed to be within five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods, where the impact on the habitat could be problematic.
In the open landscape, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also plans to specify three options for a large high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
A preferred option is the configuration of the shape of the letter Y, when one high-speed line should lead to the western Midland.
The route should be divided near Birmingham with one branch passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One route should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has been made," said a railroad expert.
Once it’s done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals are expected to allow trains to travel at 2,250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already designed to hijack 400 m long trains that would be able to carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to include the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such a potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not take place before the general election.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed lines, but on existing routes north of Birmingham and keep travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
It is considered a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from airplanes to trains, a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers paid a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on Tory orange
Alan Duncan, holder of the front seat of the Tory seat in the House of Representatives, was paid thousands of pounds last year by taxpayers for the orangery he built in his constituency house.
A spokesman for the prison party, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living “out of the dividends,” raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-lined extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of <0xC2><0xA3>100 per month, to taxpayers.
The general authorities approved the claims in good time, so he was not interrogated by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out a check on the member's expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan expressed his demands "it tended to be cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses on the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial authority agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the house a winter garden, which is in the plans referred to as "orangeries".
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules, after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupil collateral to a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>27,1406 from his London estate to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan had claimed about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month for a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
Interest on the repayment of Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all this was intended to finance a loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment declined from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, while remaining.
The latest document by municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1250 per month in May this year.
Mr Duncan left his job as shadow head of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said MPs had to survive "on parole" after the spending scandal.
"Basically it's nationalized, you have to live on assignment and treat you like s**t."
He said, "I lost money for my garden and a claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first called upon to explain his releases in May, when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before approval by the financial authority, that it "can be considered for granted".
One of the activists excavated a pond-shaped pit in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved both by the financial authority and then by Legge."
He added: "This is not a controversial issue of hiding and calling or violating the rules or something else.
It's absolutely a straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's all.
It shouldn’t have been cleaner or simpler by many other means.”
Come all of you to look carefully at the cottage on the Brighton coast with the Advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new sense of life in the autumn months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative ecclesiastical group that encourages the ecclesiastical enjoyment of creativity has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, and to use Christmas carols as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to view the last chalet from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop's bread and wine, provided free of charge.
Selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and The First Noël, when the cottage featured the work of Janetty Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old television marketing assistant from Hove, is a scholarship-free priest in the Diocese of Chichester and leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
“The idea of an advent calendar in the huts came about as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and pulsating place and we tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000, according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt a deal that could enter into force on Friday, January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said the growing global mobilization, which is clear proof of the current demonstrations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to an AFP reporter, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the march, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began to tear down the outskirts with tiles and hammers.
The regular police immediately took a heavy hit.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and said they were in particular members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups, which had already manifested in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and emphasized that about a hundred of them were in custody and in the seat "held in the streets even on Saturday evenings " and so on.
After leaving Parliament, the march went quietly towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 yards from the building without attempting to enter the building.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual meeting took place at candlelights with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue coats, created the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create “blue waves” for a “fair climate.”
Today, we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of ecological debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpilov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it is time, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams dry up, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the struggle for a different world came closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the characters fighting for a different world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At present, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for a different world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people marched, mostly students, in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces it as a "cocktail"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, while Tbilisi on the other hand declared the move a “cocktail.”
About 131,000 people were invited to take part in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 on control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazian Electoral Commission, participation was 58% a few hours before the closure of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including Acting President Sergei Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia, which condemned the elections.
These elections are fracking.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili “deplores that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian rule,” said his spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show itself through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, Kvarchija Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling room at the school in the capital, Suchumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is a major issue in the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of its beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapsh are placed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials, who came to oversee the apparent course of the elections, received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Ar<0xC5><0xA1>by.
"We, Abkhaz, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, bearing in mind the support of Moscow and especially its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations,” said Alexey Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and urged a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimbo and two traders Zaus Ardzinbo and Beslan Boutbo, criticized last year’s agreements with Moscow, such as the 10th truce deal that allows control of Russia.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive fight must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, which was also demonstrated around the world in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000, according to organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force in 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the march went quietly towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 yards from the building without attempting to enter the building.
A podium was built for the speakers, before which a spiritual meeting took place at candlelights with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town.
According to an AFP reporter, incidents occurred shortly after the departure of the march, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break the outskirts.
The regular police immediately surrounded them and attacked without waiting, while several demonstrators collided with the ground.
In total, police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and said they were in particular members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups, which were already manifested in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer was injured by a tile bone on his forehead and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents that resulted in about 20 people being arrested, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue coats, created the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create “blue waves” for a “fair climate.”

Oxfam has summoned several celebrities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students in red clothes and caps evoking the importance of solar energy, protested in front of the city hall of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met with a demand for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, said Chatel.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that subjects of history and geography will be "captured" as part of the reform of general gymnasiums, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of the gymnasium with a focus on the exact sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all will be the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister "it is necessary to end the hypocrisy", because according to him the specialization S is no longer focused on the exact sciences" but "in essence there are the best students in it".
The ES and L specializations cannot be for S some sub-specializations, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would bother that in the last year of professional gymnasiums, geography and history are not taught".
A survey by Ifop, published Saturday in the journal Humanité, showed that seven out of ten (69%) French people disagreed with the government’s project to abolish the compulsory teaching of history and geography in a graduate year with the specialization of S., therefore many scholars, intellectuals and intellectuals alike.
The minister, on the other hand, added that "it does not take into account" to cancel the philosophy in the program of specialization with the graduating year.
Luc Chatel also advocated reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilization against the project, which they say is sacrificing the pedagogical education of future gymnasium professors.
As part of Master’s Degree 2 (M2), he will take an entrance exam at the beginning of the year, focusing on their field, and at the end of the year, a further exam confirming their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
Participates in professional internships during the second year of the master’s degree and in the first year they will perform as a professor-intern in front of the students.
If you sum up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admissions procedure, you will gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reconfirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite <0xC3><0x89>cole Normale Supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince you about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is a challenge announced at the conference this morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) at the initiative of the University Ecole Normale Supérieure on Ulm Street.
As reported by one AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the “Ernest” conference, a one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute contributions from experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of which they should have a greater desire to learn something more, explained on the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local pond.
About twenty contributing experts from different scientific disciplines will be selected and clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
“We can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of fifty listeners without pre-arranged notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that the listeners will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos taken at these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will be followed with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: anger of prison supervisors, planned measures
The unions of prison guards announced a "general mobilization" on Friday as they demanded that they be paid premiums and overtimes for Christmas holidays, the payment of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FOs (2nd watchdog unions) have asked employees who will not have the service to participate in Tuesday morning demonstrations in front of prison facilities to "block" them, thus warning of "theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd trade unions in this sector) called on them to "call meetings in individual prisons and initiate a fundamental mobilization" by saying that it is "shameful and unacceptable" to "become forced to overtime and pay for work at night, at work on Sundays and on Sundays."
The first unions, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), “calls for a total mobilization (...) with the aim of expressing dissatisfaction and indignation”.
The Directorate of Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but they ensure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Mari sent a message to prison watchdogs saying that the payment would be made next month.
“I know of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system,” she said in a statement.
I have ordered the Directorate of Prisons to take immediate action to ensure that the situation that arose from a poor assessment of the number of overtimes will never be repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mariova added.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous premiums for performing functions and fulfilling goals, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "there will always be room in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, angered by the interregional union of FO in Marseille and announced its decision to boycott to appeal "all meetings and appeals".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, unless they are paid extras during these days of October in December, as well as during overtime, the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne is also threatened.
At a time when we are being given more work and more tasks without having more staff at our disposal, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to be paid for it, according to CGT prison supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better at it than others.
However, in any case the funds are scarce, stated the Secretary General of Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama Says He's Giving 'Better Gifts' On Christmas Than The One He Gets
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, has entrusted the "goddess" of Oprah Winfrey's screen with a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I receive."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening on ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a little four-legged companion of the family gets his share.
Jesus also likes Boa, Michelle Obama said, with the dog also "of course" getting a gift, as evidenced by the clips from the show's pre-show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband’s claim about the quality of gifts she receives: “No, I gave you great gifts last year,” the president joked.
Well, of course that's true, he was forced to agree to the president, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger at the pearl necklace of the first lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, very relaxed show with a famous moderator who has worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the husbands also talked to Obama about their most unpopular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a bike with a ten-speed gearbox, but also a basketball, which his Kenyan father dedicated to him at Christmas, whom he met only very rarely.
“I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas, and he gave me the basketball,” the president said.
After a long time, I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady recalled the dollhouse again.
I didn’t know how to arrange it all in the house, so I evened all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's In Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-opened in Los Angeles due to the "injury" caused by the major surgery he had in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest, while the RTL station said the singer was in artificial sleep to prevent combing and pain.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opened on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the heated plaque he had undergone in Paris on November 26.
The singer's press department, however, tried to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical communication would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put to artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will have a little more certainty, RTL adds.
The press department did not confirm or comment on this information at the request of AFP.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drones were stationed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic because of a heated fence.
The operation, which was planned a few days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art circles.
The doctor, however, was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL news.
After the operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to an infection that occurred after the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said Thursday on RTL radio that his friend was just going through a "bad period" but added that he "didn't worry about the rocker" because he's a big "fighter".
“He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, producer Jean-Claude Camus reassured the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stoped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any special concerns.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small bowel tumor" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been closely monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to dementiate the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Premiere Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a large pool, won the title of the 2009 European Championships in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, the last time the suits were allowed, only three world records fell, although much more was expected.
One of them was overtaken by the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztov<0xC3><0xA1> in the 200 m position race and the other two men's relays of Russia in the 4x50 m position race.
It was a great sadness for Bousquet, who made his mark on the world record in the 50 m freeway, who is already the holder in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two Royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won the final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, where he first started ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Dragan (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikova (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from 1 January.
The combined helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 at the same competition.
Wearing a suit this time did not help the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the large swimming pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400m freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian rider Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:82:36).
I didn't give everything to that race.
I knew I wouldn’t break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zolo's Romanesque sarcophagus plate was scrapped for $1.5 million
The sarcophagus, which belonged to no one but the French writer Emil Zol, was scrapped for $1.5 million on Thursday, which is significantly more than was estimated, the art dealer Sotheby’s said.
The price of this two-metre-long and 63-cm-high front panel, dating from the third century C.E., was estimated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
Marble "presenting four dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satires and bakchants is a rare work, similar pieces are very few in the world, maybe four or five," AFP told Florent Heintz and Sotherent.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still underway, but it’s the item that has probably been the most popular, Sotheby’s spokesperson, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The album has been in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared to the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated herself with it in her private hotel in Paris, and to Paul Reynaud, the minister of the Third Republic of France, the Marquis of Pe<0xC3><0xA1>lya, and shortly before Ra<0xC3><0xA7>a.
She remained in the shadows for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found, while searching the Louvre museum database, that this plate was part of the "remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
An Interrupted Attempt to Resign President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything for the time being shows that there is no way to carry out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos said.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelayu, flew back, a source from the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The purge government wanted to force President Zelayu to "resign" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the chance to leave safely.
But the overthrown president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state of exile.
The purges’ government “has experienced another failure when it wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globe radio on Thursday, in which it often expresses itself to the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
“I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here,” added the president, who has been hiding at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and played a couple of chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told HRN on Wednesday.
I will not apply for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview for the Telesur station, which is based in Caracas.
“If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Honduran people,” he said.
News of Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the overthrown president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army reinforced protection.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the government's position.
They show their marginal attitude towards international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized as part of preparations for his re-election public consultation, contrary to the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of “trafficking,” which he is accused of, according to the Putschist government.
President Roberto Micheletti, the leader of the Communist Party, managed to hold presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against the return of President Zelaya to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Leads to Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the U.S. trade balance shows an increase in both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on “half a full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which reflects the growth of economies of major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations, and the number of job applicants reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has fallen “to the lowest this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market is also declining.
Revenue of the state treasury with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and revenue to 30 flights rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime chant "Women in white"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime chanted on Thursday the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented further demonstrations at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Lady in White", wives or close political prisoners were stamped directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime as they marched towards the center of the capital with a demand for the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
Away with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted the regime's supporters with a raised fist to dissent.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who arrived "to ensure security".
The day before, a similar demonstration against “Dames in White” took place in Havana, but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, police officers were detained in the civilian area of about ten dissidents who were also going to protest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, the AFP newspaper reported.
According to this reporter, the police charged dissidents who were expelled from the government’s supporters into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions lasts only a few hours.
Winners of the 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize, “Ladies in White” organized an unauthorized march to “release all, according to the dissent, about 200 political prisoners,” said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda has been reprimanding 20 years.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents to be “soldiers” or “agents” paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television reported Thursday’s demonstration of the government’s supporters against the “opponents of the revolution.”
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and the one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of non-respect for human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
He killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A gunman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in a pharmacy or in front of her, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of police and witnesses.
A severely injured old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police syndicate in the hospital as a result of injuries.
In this pharmacy or before her, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of thirty, his husband began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second victim is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on Boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He injured two more people, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
It is not entirely clear how this happened, as it all happened in the evenings.
He was armed with two butcher knives carrying a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Presse, head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the insanity, according to the testimony of the AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green coat.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd, including a city police officer, who had broken his wrists, was thrown at him.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to arrest an armed man and were injured by fists, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
“I went out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed big abdominal wounds,” Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about 30-year-old, came along with a knife wound.
The man who did not have his identity card was arrested after the state police.
The state prosecutor in Nanterre handed the case over to the district police investigation department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody, waiting for interrogations.
The police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric ward.
Another police source said that six police officers were needed to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "absolutely out of self" as "all madmen of this type, whose power in action increases tenfold".
U.S.: Polish lawyer calls for end of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of Polish-French director Roman Polanski again asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a levilo in the foreground.
Chad Hummel, the legal counsel for the director of the film "Pianist" criticized in front of three judges of the appeals court of the second district of California the serious mistakes that occurred during a court overhaul at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel, adding that from the conduct of the judge who then ruled in the case, Laurence Rittenband "had a freeze in his back".
According to him, the judge (who has already died in the meantime) had to speak with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – a serious violation of the legal order.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and sought), from the mouth of the State Attorney General himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had " lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will require a court trial in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The plaintiff reiterated what had already been said at the first state hearing, namely that no serious examination of the application for the cessation of criminal prosecution will take place until Roman Polanski is brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
Los Angeles Attorney General Phyllis Asayamova said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend a court hearing."
In this case, we want to point out not only to Roman Polaski, but also to the other accused that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs. Asayamov.
He is of the opinion that the director "requests court favor and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make the decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Lawyer Hummel was not the only one who asked to stop the criminal prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for an end to the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case emerged, adding: "Nobody in this room can say that the trial was fair."
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. orders
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest at his cottage in Gstaad, where he awaits a possible expulsion.
Wall Street ends with no direction, the rising dollar stops it
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday with no direction, the market swarms among indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and a rising dollar price: Dow Jones gained <0x2B>0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended up at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased greatly and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected, and which "helped to improve the market mood in terms of economic recovery stability," said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan’s index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned and rose sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month.
But the indices have been hampered by a new rise in the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, "pulling down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological stocks are losing ground under their feet.
The stock market is declining.
Revenue of the state treasury with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and with a 30-year outlook rose to 4.497% from 4.492% a day earlier.
Miss World is back in South Africa.
After a month-long trip across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the goal of achieving their dream: to be chosen as the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty was already held in the second year around Johannesburg, and so far five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbrataru and Yanbing Maove from Canada were selected as Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen a lot of things, and I have so many experiences!” confided Miss Sierry Leone.
The competition, which will be held in the South African Republic after 9 p.m., will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, at 5 p.m. (15 p.m. world time).
I couldn't have dreamed of a more beautiful country in which I'd put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm glad I could have experienced it twice, Miss World Xenia Sukhin confided, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "land that exhales".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to step in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participates in the elections of Aishwarya Rai, the winners of 1994, who both became the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to return home with the crown,” said Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will take place in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former beauty queen of South Africa Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee Chair Steve Douglas.
The Republic of South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with the warmth it is hard to cope with, said Julia Morley, the president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
It's unusual for the president, Miss Sierry Leone noted.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwestern part of the country) for the World Cup to be held in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event by a little more.
I was able to meet people I never dreamed of.
“I’m definitely going back to the 2010 World Cup,” said Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
The reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us on Friday's arrival at the Los Angeles airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday said on his departure from the plane, which he flew from Paris sometime after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said he would "as soon as possible" get to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a postoperative infection caused by an operation on a heated intersectional sheath.
According to a press statement, the night was sung in Los Angeles for the sake of comfort “induced into artificial sleep” to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday, a physician at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, was already put to artificial sleep. The hospitalization was due to an infection after the operation of the heated intersectional bracket carried out on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by the operation, the singer had to be re-operated on Wednesday night to Thursday.
According to AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of a French high school student in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which is attended by their daughter Jade.
The Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at La Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he will fly to the singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphan Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer at the Clinique Internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles said they were upset, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "walked too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this route was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already suffered from a heat of the intersectional bracket twice, he added.
A moment earlier, RTL reported that the singer had apparently left for the Paris operation without a drain, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the hematoma caused by bleeding to the brain.
He is also a doctor with a dark reputation, condemned several times in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the medical chamber, called him “a man without a scruple” who is “regularly” called before the medical chamber and cannot be “recommended from afar.”
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He said the procedure was "completely good" and the postoperative examination was "normal".
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer’s health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains with a question mark.
It is clear that the deadline for the planned tour on January 8 (V Amiens, ed.) appears to be too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to stop using their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrancois Bayrou, responded on Friday to an attempt by Nouveau Centre president Hervé Morin to attribute the abbreviations to the former Giscardi party, with the abbreviation not to be used in any media under threat of criminal punishment.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to attribute the abbreviation UDF with the fact that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou does not deserve to carry her legacy after giving his hand to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of UMP, was scheduled to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by MEP Hervé de Charetta (former UMP now NC), who accrues ownership of the UDF brand because he was the first to register it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriet<0xC3><0xA8>re industrielle).
But on Friday evening, a UDF committee led by friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of its silence and made a formal request to both the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and hand over the abbreviation to the trusteeship, the protection of the property.
In recent days, you have raised the alarming statement that you are proposing to your political movement <0x2B> to take over <0x2B> UDF again, writes the Association in its letter signed 19 of the 24 members of the committee, of whom, for example, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Allcentre, or Artantor from Bavaria and Marielle de Sarne.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name <0x2B> Nouveau centre<0x2B>, with the slogan <0x2B>UDF today<0x2B>, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you are aware, you do not have any right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which asks the NC "immediately remove all mentions of the name of UDF from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over ownership of the trademark to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories note.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement in 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "opted to leave in 2007" in order to create a competitive movement, as did others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau Centre therefore has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to set up a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", was not "a member of the UDF for three years", but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This intactness begins to turn into a criminal act, they declare, and then ironically express themselves to the NC strategy: “It seems to us that in politics as well as in ordinary life it is more worthwhile to make a name for yourself than to make a name for yourself.”
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise-Marie Banier and rule out whether he used the state of weakness of an eighty-year-old billionaire to prepare her for part of her fortune, from which she is blamed for her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of celebrities, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a criminal offence for which a maximum of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros are imposed.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in court, which can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and fight for control of the L’Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, who was to be conducted by a college of three doctors.
L’Oréal’s heir and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre State Prosecutor’s Office during the investigation.
Doctors to be elected on Friday should draw up a report by March 10, 2010, and at the same time state whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness, and in what period.
I think he's going to do it.
I'll talk to her about it, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers's lawyer, Olivier Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
It’s an excellent report. Expertise shows that he manipulated (Mr. Banier) with this old lady in need of protection.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter launched a criminal trial against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and artisan who has been blamed for exploiting her mother’s state of weakness for many years to earn billions of dollars in bribes or cheques.
Therefore, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied that she would be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the merits of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyer's lawsuit, Friday's lawyer's speech turned into a family-run hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust of her husband Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since she got married, I’ve never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise.”
The Nanterre State Prosecution Service again found that the complainant’s conduct was not justified, especially since a guardian judge in those days rejected her request to initiate proceedings to grant legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of taking part in the trial, not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for her,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s office’s representative.
Finally, the Court decided that the eligibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be expressed at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been unnecessary.
For more than a decade, the behavior of management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the company’s approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it’s about identifying employees with the “values” set out from the mountains, which were used to produce, when they needed to consume.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction... even though authoritarian efforts to force products other than customer preferences regularly come back!
The passive approach of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that mainly affects management personnel.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI “requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate” and demands from employees commitments that are completely inconsistent with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which should aim to bring employees to the center of interest of the company as well as the client.
Relative usefulness of internal polls of public opinion.
Will internal surveys of public opinion – as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees – contribute to the revolution in management processes?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after different deviations will return to what it has always done!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionately with the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most of the management workers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of the convenience of thought, they acquire the old behaviorist theory, which is now revived by the "neurosciences" of the United States and widely distributed without much knowledge by the scientific institutions and the media.
The fact that it is possible to move the "sticks" (sic) involvement of managers, showed a recent survey by the agency Ipsos on the website Figaro.fr, which only establishes the management workers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, presupposes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic perception into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of employee motivation is only concerned with the study of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predefined dox, which allows them, through the image that tells about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resources management “on the right track”.
This creates the necessary ground for the development of a solid and efficient economic intelligence.
A statement from Oslo: "Just war" Obama deserved praise from the right.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. right welcomes a speech by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate defended the concept of a “fair war” against U.S. enemies.
The Conservatives, who first laughed at Obama's October 9 award, thanked the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what she said, Palin, a right-wing Republican muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself had voiced the “sometimes necessary” war on the subject in her memoirs, which are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would like to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessorGeorge W. Bush, on Thursday justified the deployment of forces in Oslo and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be entirely historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
A former MP, who some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "left president" remind members of the Nobel Prize committee that they themselves would not be free and could not hand over the prize for peace if they did.
According to Michael Gerson, former speech writer George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he present himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he "speaked like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble they didn't create themselves and that they don't do too much to preserve it," Gerson said.
A few disgruntled right-wingers include Bush’s era crane, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech “uniform, bubbly, and uninspired,” as he stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified by Barack Obama’s view of how he justifies the use of force.
"If we wrap war in a package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he said.
However, the centre-left press has a commendable view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the awarding of the peace prize to Obama prematurely, he rated his performance as "overpowering" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decision-making in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and repression,” the California newspaper said.
Obama “spoke what was needed,” the New York Times said, calling the speech “simple and instructive.”
Road carriers: three marathons to a deal that will save supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons, the trade unions of road hauliers and the TLF, the only employers’ organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for strikes and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies at Christmas.
Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau on Friday's signing of the agreement expressed "joy" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in the hopes that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting, which started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 18 a.m. to sign the agreement.
This conflict “would be very damaging to businesses” and “would be at risk of disrupting holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The text of the text contains an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it,” explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're ordering our members not to blockages, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the “right deal” even though it was difficult to admit the rise in high wages due to the international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It’s a common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the “historic agreement.”
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also envisages a revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow the focus to be on the issue of pay and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled a "decrease of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of the government's amending bill on the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government is asking the Senate for an “appropriate” vote.
The signature allows that this agreement will apply first to the enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the whole field, in the case of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place “in the shortest possible time,” Bussereau said.
The whole process can only be slowed down by disagreements between employers’ organizations.
The FNTR is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros "was already offered to the sector as part of the compensation of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to the emergency meeting not because of the mutual analysis, but because of the fact that it did not brighten the potato chips during the approaching Christmas holidays, complained Unostra.
According to Otre, in the next 12 months, the agreement "will bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector".
RER A suburban trains: weekend interruption, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The disruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday negotiations between trade unions and the leadership of the RATP on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results.
On Saturday and Sunday, that is, on the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only travel between 10am and 20pm, on the main section (between La Défense and Nation) every second train will travel, except for this section only one in four trains.
The connection to the SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expects more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP has been trying to secure a connection with large commercial houses”.
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP managed section leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains was running at the peak and virtually no trains were running outside the peak as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of the Ile de France arranged otherwise and there was no confusion on the steps.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things, also because there was a lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time".
The station of Saint-Lazare was not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, because a greater number of lawmakers and law enforcement officers were predicted.
The RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
Further general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership, which the unions rated as "weak" will be evaluated.
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains across all aspects, adjustment of working hours, career progression, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (The Boards of Directors).
The RATP even for the time being postponed the proposals for the premium, which worsened the CGT by saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem while it worked for the carriers and the SNCF".
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the performance of the profession will be reviewed more closely", the transport companies RATP specified.
Which was why the unions thought the business "makes weekend travelers a joke."
In the early hours of the morning, about 150 drivers were employed by a business committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, therefore decided for the meeting in the interest of "calming."
There is a risk that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday after the US and the Independents announce a strike emergency.
Trade unions are demanding a premium of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros in variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and are struggling with deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports millions of ce daily.
Drivers of RER suburban trains earn 2,200 to 2,700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros of premiums for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and holidays in the advanced period of their careers.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately sparked protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end the 25-year conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become “a bust of activities that threaten the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kilic said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president, Ahmet Türk, and a member of parliament, Aysely Tugluk, had been banned from participating in political life.
The judge also announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's property by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party’s leadership warned before the verdict that it would rather leave parliament than act as members without political jurisdiction.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "commandments" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is a legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party says it has no “fundamental ties” with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the party's dissolution could lead to a resumption of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations in recent weeks have turned up against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the ruling, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is predominantly Kurdish.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, demonstrators throwing Molotov cocktails or firing stones from the bars.
Hundreds of people were also protesting in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of justice only "deepens the desperation".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (the Kurds, ed.) by banning the party, he said in a press release.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We are against the interference of the parties.
It doesn’t matter, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete rejection of the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK registered one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
A nicely crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he would want to bully citizens, says the head of the FES winter technical services department.
But in order for his employees to be able to test and learn to control all the driving technique.
This could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
It has more than 300 employees and 120 vehicles ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows overall in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they will go to 20 so-called A sections, explains Brauburger.
These sections include major and transit routes such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and downhill sections like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to pour a damp salt within a maximum of three hours, which holds better, about 1040 kilometers.
That’s why the FES starts at three o’clock in the night, “so that the roads are free until the transport starts to work.”
It's not easy when it starts snowing until 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical department, "because no one is willing to make the suckers a place."
Only when there is so much snow, there are a number of incoming and connecting communications, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain there.
At five o’clock in the morning, FES pedestrians will go on their way, preferably to clean up dangerous places and crossings.
For the most part, the FES cannot take care of all the cycle paths.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which tracks bridges from 22 to 4.30 mainly, says Brauburger.
Since they form a fast glacier, the snails leave immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call.
Dinosaur crater
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran on two strong hind limbs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sluggish tails.
If this species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the Thursday issue of the journal Science write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinship, expansion, and the signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found dozens of dinosaur bones in one day, it's unseen for triassic settlements, says team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, there are usually only individual fragments."
Other experts on dinosaurs do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is usually controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards were divided into three main development lines: meat-eating theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-legged pat<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>saurus" and the four-legged sauropods.
Tawa hallae is the original therapist after analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of airbags, which also have descendants of theropod birds.
Thanks to air bags, bird breathing is more efficient than mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Since the lineage of giant sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation has probably already created a common ancestor of the two groups.
At Least Three Waves of Migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have exported the sharks to South America for the first time.
According to this, the three development lines soon split and spread from South America to all the continents, which at that time as the supercontinent of Pangea formed a uniform ground mass.
She would also speak for the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot come from one common, migrating ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His presumption could put together a distorted picture, because in South America, very many primitive dinosaur fossils have survived, while on other continents they are rarely found.
How the dinosaurs have proved that from a relatively rare by-line of the genus of the Plagues evolved into the dominant vertebrates of the earth in the Middle Ages remains a riddle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other pests, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while relatives died out and the interfaces of the Triassic and Jury.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, which dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the plazas did not.
Or the dinosaurs better adapted, so they could squeeze out the competition.
The success story didn’t last forever anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals, which also evolved in the Triassic and has since lived in the shadow: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has caused a worldwide stir.
278 professors and faculty at Goeth University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe, and North and South America, are in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In the statement, written in German and English, they “disapprove” the instigated police intervention by the president.
Because the walls and works of art were being started, university president Werner Müller-Estler let the building, which was occupied last week by striking students and lecturers, cleared.
Five of the students were injured.
Damage to the case, the signatories say, does not justify "violent dissolution of the self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command."
Purification is an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegitimate and criminalize the protest" and distracts attention from the content.
The presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for a halt to the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that the majority of the strikers did not support material damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the trade union organisation Verdi and the German Trade Union Union are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says Earth Youth Secretary Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hesse Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde in the Wiesbaden National Assembly.
We have an understanding of protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left have seen this.
The CDU takes the painted wall as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was a cleanup.
Linke submitted a proposal calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded site where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant micro- and nano-electronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Greengraders have made contacts with the Riedberg Research Centre in Frankfurt – with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several reciprocal visits took place and on Wednesday in Frankfurt, Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, who signed the head of planning for Frankfurt, Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to the seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchanges of information
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
Firms FIZ will be allowed to engage in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large group Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armed research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name after the wooded hilly landscape, into which the research facilities are planted.
The Stuttgart Brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For fans of the project, it is simply the "new heart of Europe".
All right. S21 is more than a train station launch, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, which ended in the city centre, were then considered to be the transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to override the locomotives from the back to the front.
Start, stop for a moment, go on - that's how it should work.
And that’s why the main railway station disappears: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hesse and Bavarian capitals the start of construction is almost unfinanceable.
Since there have been modern shuttle trains with motor and steering vehicles at both ends, the main station has not had any problems getting in and out.
Still: Starting with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulm.
This was done by local and local politicians.
The parties cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
There is a way to apologise for the project.
A new urban space will emerge, which - if we trust the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
Transit stations and the construction of the track are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has been attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must, however, be primarily about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight cars on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep ascents.
What is even more important is that the S21 indirectly touches many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros was to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts consider the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding for additional hubs and narrow spaces in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been built at a slow pace.
There would have to be a lot of pressure here.
But the S21 will be very slow.
The route through the Rhine valley will become the bottleneck of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the decision on the airport
The federal government has left the Wiesbaden National House open if it goes against the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) ruling on the ban on night flights and lets it reconsider.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today explained in writing that if the planned northwestern edge of Frankfurt Airport were to be built, the state would have to re-adjust the night-time ban.
The permit for 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the local government, does not comply with the law ordered to protect the population from night air noise.
The Coalition must decide by January 4 whether to request a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised the delay and urged the government representative to relinquish the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises it made about the ban on night flights before the election, otherwise it can be judged as "a violation of the word in question".
“It’s damn hard if you can keep your word,” Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said in an appeal to the FDP’s electoral slogan, “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s appeal, as the country’s government is trying to get to its night flights by “crossing the law and tricks.”
Exact legal scrutiny needs your time.
The Coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction’s statements on the banning of night flights have never been the same as the opposition submits.
U.S. Banks Pay Aid
The American, crisis-ridden big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
The Bank of America paid a total of $45 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the bank’s rescue fund Tarp on Wednesday.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to pay state aid.
The institutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that came with accepting money - the limitation of bonus payouts to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has secured $19 billion in net cash from investors thanks to interchangeable bonds.
The remaining amount was taken from its cash register, which was filled, inter alia, thanks to trade union sales.
Kenneth Lewis, the head of the bank, expressed his gratitude to the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection helped us overcome the difficult times.
The Monetary Institute has hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by providing money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, said the U.S. bank could announce a capital increase of around $20 billion as early as Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid for the aid.
A quick choice
It just went faster than what was expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors pushed out of the office of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the Grammy was supposed to agree on that person.
A favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital Berlin.
However, the station did not confirm it - officially, so as not to advance the process.
However, the role could also be that they did not want to harm ZDF lieutenant Markus Schächter unless the proposal was passed by the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 Grammy members.
The result of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of office was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it could be expected to be a defeat for him, with only seven members voting for him, seven against him.
A majority of the EU’s board of directors signalled several weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
Opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hesse Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue in the office of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the argument that, under Brender, the quotas for the surveillance of the ZDF intelligence broadcast fell.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence of the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last time, 35 state-law lawyers were involved in the debate, who consider Koch’s procedure to be unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; since then head of the main studio ZDF.
After Brender, who was voted Media Magazine’s journalist of the year on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they were filing a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board, Rhine-Falk Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the lieutenant's personal proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, slammed the board of directors with a clever chess move - immediately after the defeat of Brender, the Grammy strongly criticized it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face to both Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the page would be pushed to the office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is one of the left-wing liberals.
Studying to Get Rid of Harms
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the ministers of culture finally entered the federal countries on Thursday: At the conference of the Ministers of Culture and the Rectors of higher education, both parties agreed that they want to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: Essentially, each study module should be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and a "real and defensible rate" should be guaranteed.
To this end, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
Federal countries are committed to creating more flexible joint structural assignments for undergraduate and master’s study areas.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Culture and the University Rectors have had words in their mouths about better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board has decided that the number of exams is partially drastically reduced: “Each module will usually be completed only once,” writes a 30-page report, which is partly intended to re-regulate the approval of study areas.
"A significantly lower test load," Reinhold Grimm, the chairman of the accreditation board, said, "is to stop the erroneous development that significantly limited the study's complexity."
To do this, the "challenge of study" in the future will be the "decisive criterion" in implementation.
Modules and content must be “hardly checked” to “not necessarily restrict students when choosing
The seminars.”
Students should have "a demand for space that allows and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, after review, but also for existing fields of study.
They need to be “re-accredited” every five years – which means it will take until 2015 for all the study areas to be reviewed.
In charge of this, there are ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation boards set up by the federal states.
In October, the culture ministers called on the federal states to act on the agencies in such a way that the filling of the classroom was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed with the state ministries on the appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, the Rhine-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
With the money, universities should primarily pay for consultancy programs and study counselling, and strengthen test and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to submit to the parliament a novelle of the university law.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, to ensure the recognition of examinations from other universities and to facilitate the access of the master.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all study areas in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition again agreed on the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Directors of Juso Higher Education Groups has called for the development of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word" should also be spoken by the students as the person concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the conference of university rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom HRK was discussing a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow every bachelor’s degree graduate access to a postgraduate master’s degree.
Secondly, the federal states must ensure that there are enough places available tomorrow for today’s generation of undergraduate students in master’s degree fields with the best possible study conditions, said GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on free access to master’s programmes.
More than a note under the line to Hert Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this ragged piece of language themes the experience of the arrival of a dissident, who has gained self-reliance, self-reliance.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant extraliterary turmoil was taken care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts".
Söllner, who was obviously insecure and infected, left a statement in which Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, admitted to cooperating as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
Attempts to recruit were said to have begun unnoticed, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "someone who has not sufficiently resisted the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Hert Müller and its unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of dictatorial government is a literary scene, and in particular a community of German authors who are in control of the politicking and control of Romania, shaken by the politicking and rumbling of the case.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the Acts of Securitate, Secret Agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence on himself by Secret Agent Walter.
“He was hitting me at all the points that mattered to him,” Markel says.
It is my moral duty to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in this form and in front of this audience unexpected, but completely surprising, the confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote as early as July, when she read her own 914-page document, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate spikes.
The suspects, it may be assumed, will speculate and in some cases probably know which name is hidden behind the cover name of Sorin, Voic, and also Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, in the meantime very certain review of the components of the Stazi, the manipulation with the remnants of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic illumination has been sluggish and limited.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Components of Securitate (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act has been going on for quite a long time since then.
It is only since 2005 that there is a law that governs the management of components.
The fact that the former Securitate members still have a great influence in Romania, he proved after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller one interview in which one of the former Securitate bosses from Temeswar spoke out against the holder of the award.
She says she has psychosis, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The humiliation of power has been expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as in the case of Söllner, as in the case of the impunity, there are inevitable questions.
The peculiar reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves the expectation that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than by the admission of guilt and study.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a note under the line.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed salesman came from a cute Christmas party at which the manufacturer of sports goods was giving out sweets when he was performing a quarter of an hour after midnight in the summoned Mercedes C-Class Ora<0xC5><0xBE>ov<0xC3><0xA1> s<0xC3><0xA1>ra<0xC5><0xBE>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, the new coach from VfBr in Spondu<0xC5><0xA1> in Christian Gross.
The man with the markings of baldness was allowed to drive after him in an even stranger town.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in play, and fortunately the 55-year-old man was also drunk.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow it will continue to work.
Or it's just getting started.
The words of just three days of the committed <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xAD>car: "Although we have reached the eight-finals", i.e. in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 victory over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the downhill."
The "far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mohu<0xC4><0x8D> even on a regular league day.
And to avoid re-obvious weaknesses after the three quick goals of Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Lottery
The Champions League eight-finals (released 16/17. <0x2B> 23/24. February / match played 9/10. <0x2B> 16/17. March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the trepidation of Babbel's successor will therefore be preserved.
Not only in the case of a suspected healer, who gave unsure Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to deploy and joy from the game within a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and I encouraged them to be bolder, explained the Soul Healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which however, under the influence of the therapist Babbel, proved no longer effective.
As Babel's follower Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes into football, sometimes things happen that you don't think are possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break from injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" detected by the proverbial "fresh wind" and by the working procedures of the new superintendent.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sporting president Horst Heldt
However, VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
As Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against a weakened substitute and totally overburdened defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before there was a nasty awakening after a 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sporting chairman Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not behind the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events that were freshly revived in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
They are decisions that act other than Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He presided over the leadership of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure from pubertal fans.
Even the fact that he was canceled his day off after the matches, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing consistency for the goalkeepers.
The 40-year-olds will no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they agree with each other that without the work of a coaching team, it would not be possible to have such a playerly strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the igelite bag agrees.
World Heavyweight Championships (WWF)
Passionate duel in Bern: Inviter Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitalia Klitschka.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight of the WBC boxing organization.
The decision of the arbitrators was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Klitschko remains world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka it is the third successful defending title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, he was twice World Champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out what everyone expected.
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional matches and was beaten twice due to injury.
Inviter Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th match.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena, the 2.02-metre-high Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko contest was conducted mainly with his left hand.
By eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era ahead of the duel, had stepped forward in front of the World Champion strikes, so Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In total, the passive Johnson did quite a bit on the inviteer and just tried to get into the next round.
The clique provoked words and gestures, but his blows hit the world champion rarely.
But he was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek in twelve rounds.
Before the fight, the summoner took care of the riots in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschka as a "repulsive zombie" who "doesn't do anything right."
During the weighing on Friday, the champion was provoking himself, pulling Johnson’s sunglasses off his nose so he could “see his eyes.”
The fourth victory after the return of Klitschko
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remained undefeated even after the fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back the "his" WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight before.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one injury and I was physically in good shape, explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
His dream remains, however, the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye, after he landed from the throne of 2.13 meters tall Nikolay Vulajev in November.
Haye canceled the fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promotional company is reportedly planning a fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The case of Kund<0xC3><0xBA>z
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has labeled Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar for misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left (Left) call on the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the attack on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
Minister for the deadly bombing of two tankers in September said "deliberately untrue," Green faction leader Jürgen Trittin told ARD's "Tagesschau" on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual term: Lie.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the NATO report that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about the destruction of stolen trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US air strike, which was demanded by German Commander Kunduzu Colonel Klein, a NATO investigation found that up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Federal House and also explain what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Ms. Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal House - and, if the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from the Greens called on Renata Küv<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s Office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also strong doubts about the Ministry’s impeachment over the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially it was heard that they should deny the existence of NATO messages and silence the minister for sensitive details.
However, it was heard from around the two top officials that they had alerted the Ministry of Defense even to several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert had in the meantime asked for clarification in a letter.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The Ministry did not comment on Saturday’s statements and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the Investigative Committee of the Federal House of Representatives, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in a waking state and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in drug use, the boundaries between imagination and reality are intertwined.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest ideas and imaginative delusions.
But those who live in the wake of a dream state, see and hear things that others do not see and do not hear, in today’s Western world, are often paid for as a fool or drug addict, or at least as a freak.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug use.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, here and there make sure that they merge the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of blushing, psychosis and hallucination can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when the balance of neural brain transmitters - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is impaired and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misconceptions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, in 1861 stated "a great resemblance to the wandering of dream states", for Sigmund Freud it was even a dream "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions".
In the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and screamingly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it flows at the ceiling of the room.
Feelings of tingling.
Behind him, winged Chertian figures with bloody red grimaces, cherishing teeth.
They chase him, dig into him with heavy, fiery boots, throw him against a wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices are threatening from the walls and from the radio.
He can't stand the voices that are insulting and insulting to him anymore.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, locks them in a loop, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
You step on one speaker and you put a loop around your neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn, yelling at the congregation's voices, whistling his drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be cured!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was triggered.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is maniodepressive, takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fears and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a horrendous fact
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
With acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an exaggerated state that can lead to hallucinations, sizing, relationship illusions, or the illusion of persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is unable to distinguish important from unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinics of General Psychiatry at the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparing with reality is usually not possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, Fuchss says, “but the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved.”
Stupid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place within the real framework.
Scientists are still facing a puzzle as to why our brains are making such messes.
“Extraordinary conditions can lead to a short-term loss of a relationship with reality,” says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development, neuronal maturation of the brain will be damaged, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
However, it remains a mystery as to how there will be a breakdown of the neural system, which has not been manifested in any way for many years.
The influences of the environment also play a role – stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition for it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains are boiling
It’s crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
If we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of attitude.
Casten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year interpreting his results in the book "Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf".
While hallucinations are among the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, they are also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, it hallucinates the brain of a healthy person under certain conditions.
According to Kasten, hallucinations consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or less suppressed; when our brain is boiling, or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries with love or other exceptional states.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported that they experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the gymnasium there.
Actually, she's a normal girl.
If it weren't for the shapes and voices.
At breaks, she may be approached by a colonel with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with a surprise - no one else sees her and does not hear this boy.
This cowardly girl is considered a secret dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
He wakes up, hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees a girl sitting next to him on the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather shrinking.
Often, overloads are a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot watch the lesson many times, because in her eyes and ears the teacher is presenting a new pupil, but he explains to everyone else in audible and visibly on the table of the mathematical equation.
Appearances are rather shrinking at night.
When he waits in his dark room for a sleep that rarely comes and is too late, he cannot often tell whether he is awake or is already asleep, whether the images he sees, the grimas, or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on her arms and legs, appear before them.
Leave me alone, yelling at those characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted Kasten's psychologist online, she knows exactly that she didn't go crazy.
Too much is also the art of desperation.
If someone is socially isolated or stimuli are taken away, they’re likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think the brain then doesn't have enough jobs and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., single, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man her father calls her from the time she thinks he is not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same areas of the brain that also process real senses and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Each experience," says Kasten, "is also a reality.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to form, which is why they act so real.”
Also, the night dreams evaluate Casten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises his patients to value hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our overly conscious world, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatric and psychotherapeutic clinic at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - overcrowding is also the art of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a peculiar form of altered dream consciousness.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the affected person considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them retrospectively from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor degeneration with full consciousness.
When a person is endangered by the loss of the world and himself, such as a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to cope with a situation, worlds will change, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of support for the senses and the transfer of the senses into some unbearable situation, which allows us to pass our own capacity to form within a moment into the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even in later memories.
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his one-irode experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after a heartbeat surgery with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness turned on a several-day journey, with his body lying stationary on the intensive care unit.
Claussen dived into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man clinging to his bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
It lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility that produces intoxicating substances from the blood.
On a motorcycle, he is kidnapped by a Greek man to his homeland, surfs on a hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It submerges itself completely into the imaginary story, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Clausen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are still clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in a vigilant state.
Every change in the state of consciousness, concludes Kasten, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
A reality that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
Here.
At the age of 27, the publishers will take over children.
The new editor-in-chief of Kallen is a transitional solution: For the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The company will be 100% owned by the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old SPIEGEL man.
We have dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is posed only after that.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees in front of their children if they are not capable enough.
It would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he has been stepping down from the board since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Subsequently, Kaskadna added responsibility for the company’s assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s resignation, Direct Marketing, Cizina, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callen’s appointment also serves to “overwhelm 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
The holding is expected to belong to a 100 percent family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure about the demise: "It has always affected companies who have let themselves be infected by the desire for capital, who have speculated and thought they can become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play World League with Time, these trades are too big.

Ending in Barcelona, by electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'Live Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalonia.
LIVE' (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and will ensure agreements on mobility, deal with, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in the European standardization teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts 'calm period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is awaiting a “pacific period”.
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009 Zapatero summarized the measures that were introduced during the year in support of the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitive Plan for the automotive industry, we would have a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our major manufacturing companies,” the prime minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm in this industry is envisaged in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competition plan, which forms part of the Integrated Automobile Industry Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilised investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government’s support for the requirement and mentioned the 2000E Plan, which is applied in cooperation with the autonomous regions and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan allowed the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles.
The first International Classic Car Show will be opened in Madrid, which is a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of motorcycles.
This initiative will take place from 5th to 7th February 2010 at the Casa de Campo Glass Pavilion in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, which will be represented by more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and inquisitors.
Among the companies involved will be the following: Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and repair of cars; or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, specialized firm Mercedes Benz.
Exterior eligibility tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports performances, rehearsals, presentations and competitions.
Proficiency tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in a customised circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Maintaining sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on the sporting style.
And that’s why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system – also known as “Stop”, which is a device currently available only with a petrol engine of 2,150 horsepower.
This second-generation Mazda3 is characterised by the good features it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seats, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using the set of tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues in the Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinct red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are in contrast to the nucleus of German products and specifically even more with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and a 150 horsepower six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very delicate, characterized by reduced noise level, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention above all the track tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, the control of traction and stability, the control of speed, the inner mirror of the sliding mirror, the audio and sliding mirrors 17, the on-board computer with a large monitor, the sensor of the screen, the car.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional 1,500 euros: adaptive dual-xenon lights and BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and a high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine2.0 and 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which makes 21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re'
L.A. has a red carpet, delicate as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have been dazzling more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the 'Nine' brand. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the ability to view certain types of attachments or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine rated him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one is exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, for which, however, it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented at Le Web yesterday, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as well as its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly cost for maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or impatiently search for a café with WiFi (or a phone connection) to view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for lowering roaming tariffs so that they are accessible to all of Europe, which still has no desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it’s interesting that it’s still called Fon when it doesn’t have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various offers to compensate for their data network.
The Kindle is another nice example, offering downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complication.
This device is connected and pays for purchases, not for months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen one day in the case of FonPeek, this is a possibility of buying with a permanent approach like that Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the point of view of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama’s inauguration as President of the United States, she chose dresses and coats in this color, and she also chose the same color when accompanying him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to the fact that it was a similar color - yellow-green with sparkling effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a jacket made of the same fabric- decorated with a large embroidery or embroidery.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of her entry into the role Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo with a print.
Changes and accessories: green shoes with medium heel, now a similar model, but in gold color.
She also wears various hairstyles: this timehard, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have problems with maternity work.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among women of younger age who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of a study ‘Fertility and working careers of Spanish women’ conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women’s Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to maternity.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of partner cohabitation, there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth to their first child, and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, defer partnership cohabitation and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years since the beginning of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and therefore had to postpone their partner cohabitation as well as their income.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on maternity, although a minor impact on the time of initiation of cohabitation with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age at which women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35-49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
“There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education get married and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education prefer to have a stable job, before marriage and the birth of their first child.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The actress 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of international level, is thus added to other famous L'Oréal Paris personalities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish actress Penelope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the Cottage') joined this selected club.
The men's part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'Lost').
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives – designers and models, past and present – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vicenta
Manuel Vicente donates thirty x-rays of the writers he encountered in his literary life (and in some cases in ordinary life) in 'Ess Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente).
He does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but he seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicente does not save relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s pleasure, even in re-reading.
Here are some remarks.
On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of antidote, the morality without guilt, and the innocence without any god.
“The nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him.”
About Graham Green: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure, and torment, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by way of damnation."
James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the eighty-thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers are often knocked down."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said of himself that he is the heir to a county estate, and at other times that he is the son of a black man with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge the confused cry of this man from Munich to bring his resonance to the night of the twentieth century in his literary form, fleeing to himself and calling to the future, and speaking sharply."
Dorothy Parker once knelt down and prayed, “God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.”
Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After effort comes a dream,/after a storm a quiet harbor,/after a war of rest,/after a full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the assailants or that the birds were singing Greek.
“No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.”
P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Santos do than focus Joyce on Barojo?
What else did Benet have to do than let Baroque execute Faulkner's weapon?
What else was the purpose of the whole but to be famous at the expense of that man’s glory?”
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed by and our dog, a crusader rescued from a shelter with a weight of no more than six kilograms, without a single word.
Our anger is all the more so, that we see nothing amusing in such aggression against a small, defenseless animal that was also on the line.
And to this the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on the walk, she began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-obsessed man who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man, an old man or something.
It happened at five o’clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
Sandy was crying all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the nearest commission, but we doubt that it was of any use, and, in order not to raise the questionable questions, we find that these cowardly killers were of Spanish nationality.
Anger caused us to announce the fact of the matter.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they’re having fun worrying about a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don’t understand where the right education, respect for animals and people have been divided.
Michelin and Fesvial together for wearing helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both entities today reported.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of the use of a helmet, as it is the only means that can be avoided by head injury or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin says the campaign is part of its commitments to road safety, which "means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products," and confirms that it is trying to achieve this goal in other ways, i.e. through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a helmet when riding a motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', is the first stage in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be placed in signposts to bring awareness to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of two-wheeler tyres and whose main goal is to continuously improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain accounted for a 12.6% increase compared to 2008, and what’s more, the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures from the parent organization of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam sellers.
However, a positive figure is better to put into quarantine, since November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and was a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger cars, pick-up trucks, small trucks and light trucks/trucks.
And even the clouds that are most damaging to demand didn’t disappear, even though they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and in 100% of the cases it’s financing through third parties.
Other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation need to be added to the constraints resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the 2000E purchase did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention the entrepreneurs on the list of small and medium-sized companies that plan to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
It was just yesterday from Ganv<0xC3><0xA1>m that it was necessary to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Sellers predicts that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the calculations sales of passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The manual braking auxiliary system is already mandatory.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with the ESP stability control, with the help of manual braking systems, all this will become mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the others have a deadline for eliminating the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase the protection of pedestrians, while working in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary manual braking system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver crashes.
However, this pressure does not always hold up to the end.
According to a study carried out by auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers who had an accident did not brake before the crash and half of them did not use the full force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Conversely, this assistance requires maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be prevented per year.
Reducing this number will be even more significant—according to calculations, one of four accidents with an impact on people—after the introduction of so-called intelligent manual braking systems would be prevented.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and minimise the risk of damage.
General Motors Defers Plan for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told the employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as informed by the Times more.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed to by the party concerned.
And as a result, it may happen that the final document, which will first be presented to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, will be issued by the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken on these days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM allows for contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skype, which operates under the patronage of the Russian Converg group.
In the event that it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains valid if its sale is unsuccessful.
Driving with the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this jewel-like model, the engineers from Porsche used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of the weights of the wheels, first of all, the weight of the wheels of the wheels of the wheels of the wheels of the wheels of the wheels of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars of the cars.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also available with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, one vehicle with a manually tuned six-speed gearbox has been tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountainous areas with many wire bends.
His behavior can only be qualified as intangible.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle does not press towards the asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model in a long time, which at the same time would carry such safety when moving in turns, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete able to warm the muscles during a short drive for the required time, until we order him a sprint, braking, and restoring the use of the engine...
Whatever we want. With a drive that is as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we point our hands at the steering wheel, that's what the car will do.
And it does it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine according to the will
The sound of the V6 boxer, of 320 horsepower (by 10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and it is possible to amplify it with the option of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used in the Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recovery.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive with the Boxster Spyder was pretty devastated, but the car managed well with the spills.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some corners we encountered at dawn on the frost and gravel even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the most fun on the market, as it’s more than just a Boxster S modification.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 for 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon series and occasional 'starlette' at the 'firm' shows, the singer presents her face to the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins victory in Israel
She won a brilliant victory in 82-91 in her stay on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus got to the top of her group after a great performance by Mirzy Teletovica (29 points).
The Vitoria Society succeeded in replacing the significant absence of Herrmann, Olesson, Huertas, or Mic with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to endure to the end to gain victory.
In addition, the great accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started as a front for the blues, who from the beginning stood on the mark.
The fact that the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli cooperative very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for Barac's inner game and Elijah's work, which was received by singing and applause upon returning to its original venue to increase the advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to appear as the best in his 13-point team, although 'without six' in the Splitter rating already indicated that it would not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'hand Elias' managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the return of the 'yellow' to the expulsion (50-49).
More Inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded, but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to breathe, and there appeared the machine gun Mirza Teletovic, who with three triples almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribase returned the scores of 67 points to a calming number (54-67).
The Alawites fell to their skin in the last half and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to prepare them for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from a three-point line-up (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter excluded for the foul, SeIvanovic did not lose and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him to lead Group B in the Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Society of Malaga did not interfere with the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship nor with the rival, perhaps one of the most ill in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, brightened the field s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local arsenal in the indoor game with Bourouses, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, a 13-minute, which was the moment when the battle between the tops with USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek cooperative began to operate and proved its dominance in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to Joel Freeland's injury and three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaj cooperative.
Between the internal players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the lead to 44-32, 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite losing 19, proved to be dominant and even managed to make up for the difference from the match in Malawi Malaga 66-48, a 27 minute, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the drawbacks Unicaja, thanks to the lead and three points Cook and Lewis's contribution, left a certain hope of winning 66-57, the 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and dominance in centimeters in his zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to balancebasket average 81-62, the 37th minute, and Unicaja slammed and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new app Trovit, the search engines with the highest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has available in Spain, using the form available on Facebook, where you need to put your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
During the week that the app works, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally “feels poorly rewarded,” explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the Trovit product.
According to the data that Trovit has available from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros gross per year and the French 31,059, while Spain receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is a waiter with 11,592 euros of net per year; followed by a seller with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network over the last three months are a driver, a part-time job, and a social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelayo's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the continuation of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The president-elect must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, charge d’affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27th, after the end of his term, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to gain refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, was trying to save him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where traders do not make decisions about them themselves.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was the direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of near-zero liquidity so that financial institutions could buy assets for depreciation.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are practically over, and without questioning their insidious liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little bit of sand into the coffin, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors are therefore questioning the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in the return on reducing risky returns.
The mobility of the stock exchange and the differences in the bondscompanies have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected the public debt.
It is again pushing for quality and the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven of choice for investors, expanding the differentiation of the eurozone countries from Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but Standard & Poor's came at the time and threatened a new revision of the decline in the qualifications of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useless to silence advocates of moral risk, who once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy for slowing down the destructive consequences of restricting credit to employment, if in fact it would be n
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore power in the emirate, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen that before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections, and a new government comes in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow euro member countries to default on their commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin will force the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its own citizens to joint responsibility when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalization of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on the supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our disparities in public debt will increase, as will the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If Europe’s disparities are reduced and ours continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The concern of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the services of the studies to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their upscene to 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the scale of the Japanese economy.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "carefully, friend of the driver".

President Iberdrola Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n spoke for the first time yesterday in front of the parliamentary subcommittee, where he discusses Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n made several remarks to the press on the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 million by 2020 and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60,000 million by 2030 if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are maintained.
If that were not the case, the necessary investment would not be $60,000 million, but up to $95,000 million.
In fact, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020, the issue will change and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes the draft law on a sustainable economy that has just been passed by the government, corresponds to the line that the company has demanded, did not want to leave the vein as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, the “clear long-term bet” is in this sense, despite the “accurate” measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although long-term, need to be taken now, because their maturity is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed for their launch.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which economic deadlines have not yet expired, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation on the creation of the Center for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be the research of energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water company.
The building in question is a tunnel estimated at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 million).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
The five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to settle in that country as a construction and concession highway company.
The city wants to have the tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP by initial in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan protected by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, and the projected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (EUR 1,047 million) and in the final phase of the competition three companies with a significant presence in European buildings.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest underground construction specialists.
Northern Direct is playing against the Acciona Group with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group to go through the network is called LBRJV and is part of the Australian capital Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), as well as the local civil company Baulerstone (ownership of the German specialty company Raulderstone).
The Australian infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatization, but brings with it a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to the Asian references, is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted company Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is committed to the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that build and manage a 700 million-budget Adelaide desalination plant.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and to use common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
An underground toll road, sponsored by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, named Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway from Toowong to the roundabout route at Kelvin Grove (see map) in a 5 kilometre-long tunnel crossing.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be built in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane has already offered this job Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit as Hochtief announced a deal with the government yesterday estimated at 154 million euros.
The shareholder ACS will operate through its local subsidiary Leighton the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet to 400,000 people and provide the job of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-story King George Tower project in Brisbane, Australia, to begin construction work, and Hochtief closed for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, Laing O’Rourke will participate in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
The FCC was awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, has acquired a 2.1-kilometre tunnel construction grant for the motorway in Slovenia worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company was awarded a contract several days after work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Austria) for 130 million euros.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The work is scheduled to begin at the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore Receives Advertisement at Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services over the past two years to Mrs. Rushmore for approximately three million euros a year, the railway company said.
The contract includes the possibility of a 12-month extension each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented themselves in a competition written by Renfe, four of whom went to the final, among them TBWA , who was responsible for the creation of the advertisements.
From this moment on, Ms. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
$63 million fine for France Télécom for braking competition
France’s competition regulator has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean, which belongs to the country.
According to this institution, the operator restricted the competition of landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the edge of regulation.
With this sanctions, the former French monopoly and the state-owned company have bought more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
Business with Applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice broadcasts.
From the outset, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into countries other than Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is held by Manchester United.
The list is held by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has allocated 5,362.5 million euros among 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since the start of the tournament in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third in the continent with the most money he earned for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won the top prize three times.
The current champion of Catalonia and the last winner of the lost European Cup in 1992 is in fifth place.
Manchester United and Munich’s Bayern, the two clubs that have also earned the most money for the Champions League.
And that's despite the fact that she lost both to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to earn the most money through the Champions League, although it has won the most titles out of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribute
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
This year, the body chaired by Michel Platini is set to make $1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (among other things Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
in addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participated in.
There is also a prize for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Eight-finalists will receive three million each; eight quarterfinalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four will get $4 million.
The champion will earn $9 million, while the second finalist will earn $5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a won <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments, which are allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>337.8 million.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group has announced the details of the offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,5025 per share that it would have paid in ten years and for which it would have paid interest at this 1% deferment per year.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares ended trading at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa’s offer values the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of the Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of the Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible bids to buy and settle the court fluctuations of its former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazar, it was announced the election of Maria Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of internal audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a high-ranking position in a food business.
This is a newly created position that will be directly subject to the group president.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company continues to be plunged into a legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the companies of the Salazar brothers.
De facto it is not possible to eliminate the possibility that in the coming months the Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
As for the Salazars’ credit, former council members Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Norieg (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified yesterday before the National Court that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorizes the exclusion option of Paternina, which participated in Investor Mer
The National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion of Investor Mer from Federica Paternin on October 9.
The Authority explained that it allowed the operation, since it understood that its conditions were in accordance with the applicable standards, and considered that the content of the explanatory brochures submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December was "sufficient".
CNMV clarified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the capital of the company, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares accepted for trading on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been quashed, which could not be transferred in any way until the tender, which he specified, was set by Federic Paternino in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards, was closed.
New tools for car valuation
These days, storms and accidents are not just making money from car services.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are pulled to a service where the expert has to estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating manually the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for estimating insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information that manufacturers provide to them in order to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group of Solera is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation and information-processing tools for the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduard Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Audatex’s trade director, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data for processing is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been listed in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphics processing is carried out, where it is possible to "push out" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week, if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. At present, Audatex has at its disposal complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.

They exceed 99% in terms of the rolling stock in circulation.
Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) to carry out the documentation and database development work, each of which specialises in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work at the same time with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are uploaded every month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast stream of information allows businesses to make different uses and deliver different products.
The most common use focuses on repairs and maintenance, but there are also, depending on the country, tools for the management of spare parts or for the calculation of the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States yes.
Considering the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get the support that professionals in the sector can use.
This company offers ten differenttools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard insurance event award solution designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or varnish.
This tool is valid depending on the use for each assessment.
The highest price is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.75 for customers who use it little, up to a maximum of ten times per month.
Then each insurance company, which makes thousands of estimates, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the complete identification of the vehicle and equipment that came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to disable vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models a particular brand has undergone service due to an accident or how many suffered a serious insurance incident during a certain period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices, and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, accidents or car maintenance.

Internet Auction of Cracked Vehicles
Last October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation envisaged the transfer of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The goal of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is provided exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who need to register before starting operations.
Founded in 1996 in Germany, the platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been discarded cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles of historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been discontinued, after prior driving.
Service Budget in Four Steps <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user will get the budget in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for spare parts, creation of budget planning budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new driving techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired using the chassis number, a real graphical view of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user may include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At the moment, Audatex is working on making this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it allows, for example, to select a door and turn it to show the inside.
