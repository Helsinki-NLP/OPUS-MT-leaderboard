The number of new recruits preparing to be sent to Donbass from Ukraine is named
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) Andrey Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to the Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans "at least to complement the units".
"The unwillingness of citizens of Ukraine to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass dismissals have led to a low number of units," Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians called into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kyiv began the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the United Forces (USF).
It was assumed that this measure will lead to a strengthening of the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass exacerbated due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities classified what happened as a terrorist attack.
Several people involved in the explosion were detained during the investigation of the criminal case.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by the Ukrainian secret services.

The head of the British Foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
Britain’s Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states of the community.
With such a statement, the diplomat spoke at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, then the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity,” he said.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

A few years earlier, when he was cold, he planted a mucus from his own nose on a cup of Petri (this is a glass lid in which experiments with bacteria are carried out) and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
Almost as accidentally, penicillin was also found.
Fleming's name has been included in the list of the 100 most prominent personalities in human history.
Its discovery, according to many scientists, has changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases, previously considered incurable, - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than a dozen divisions."
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his powder was buried in the famous London Cathedral of St Paul.
Where, by the way, ours and the wife paid attention to this by a word-of-mouth Russian-speaking tour guide.
And a few more years later the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had to observe in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas Corridor, the most famous Spanish matadors have set up a monument to a man whose efforts have saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of the Corridor.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not at all about it.

Trump Talks About “In Love” with Kim Jong-un
From the mutual cruelty of the leaders of the United States and the DPRK have almost reached the love of each other, Donald Trump joked.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made a successful joke about his successes on the front of resolving the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now corrected relations so much that they are hardly in love with each other, the US president noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama’s team had launched relations with the DPRK so much that they couldn’t even call the country’s leadership – they simply didn’t take the tube there.
The U.S. and the DPRK were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House “beautiful letters,” Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also "brutal" to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, their relationship has now improved to such an extent that the leaders “were in love with each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently halted nuclear and missile tests, as well as shutting down military regiments.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, the American president is confident.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump made a step-by-step remark about Kim Jong Un from the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first ever talks between the US and North Korean leaders took place in Singapore.
After a serious escalation of relations and mutual threats to the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a breakthrough in the prolonged US-Korean crisis.

Positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps to denuclearize North Korea are still under way.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the U.S. had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangsters.”

Nice urged to expel "Moscow language with Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nicei called to expel from Ukraine "Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language".
To do this she offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
With her thoughts on the "importance of the eradication of the Russian language in Ukraine", Nice shared with the Ukrainian publication "Observator".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians “recover” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian speech was used widely on television and radio before, but in the public space it practically did not remain.
At the same time, in the opinion of Nice, Ukrainians do not apply aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Earlier, Nice shared her experience of supporting the “Ukrainian-speaking regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court of a network of Watsons bookstores, the cashier of which one communicated with her in Russian.
Not having achieved her own, Nicole threw a girl in surrender.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians, she calls "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Recently, Nice said that the name "Russia" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer was not able to escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.
During the break, they had a male conversation, and it brought its fruit.
Defender of "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the game of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.
"Denise, what do you think made it possible for you to win?"
“I think we wanted to win more,” Kulakov said on the official Ural website.
“Such a difficult game turned out, they had a serious men’s talk in the break, and it brought its fruit: they scored two balls and did not miss.
“You missed a few games because of the injury you got earlier this month.
How did you feel today?”
“If you can hold on for 90 minutes, that’s fine.
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe, at the end of the day, a little bit of power so that nothing happens.
And so, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Hashnev brought me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
“What about the atmosphere on the team?”
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
We now have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We have to continue in the same spirit and cheer the fans.”
"Did you miss the game when you didn't go out on the field?"
"There's something, I missed it a little bit, because really, the unpleasant situation came out.
But I will say it again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put you on your feet.
The most important thing is that we have won and cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary.”

Violations were recorded in a referendum in Macedonia
Four incidents related to violations of electoral law have been registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was announced on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Interior Toni Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.
At the polling station in the primary school "Lazo Angelovski" in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. violated public order and tranquility, insulted citizens and attacked policemen.
He was arrested and taken to the police station.
According to the representative of the foreign ministry, all the perpetrators were immediately transported to police stations.
The Ministry noted that for all violations a check is being carried out.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to comply with the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of voting,” the representative of the Ministry of Interior said.
In a referendum on Sunday, citizens are asked to answer one question: “Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17, during a ceremonial ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which crosses the border between the two countries, signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This treaty should solve not only the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to NATO and the EU.

Such an opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian foreign ministry Valid Muallem in an interview with the TV channel RT, which aired on Sunday.

I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful to Russia for its efforts in this regard," the minister said.
The head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive system, not an offensive system, and it is designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinyan hopes to hold early elections to the parliament of Armenia in 2018
Elections to the Armenian parliament can be held as early as 2018, the country's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said.
"It is not excluded, until the end of the year," the head of government replied to the question of journalists about the deadlines for their conduct (quoted on "Interfax").
Mr. Pashinyan also did not rule out that he would “bring people back to the streets” for emergency elections if the discussion of the issue with parliamentary forces was not successful.
But I'm ready to negotiate with the parliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also geared towards a constructive dialogue,” the Armenian-Novosti Prime Minister said.
Pashinyan added that early elections are a “request for the people” as well as part of the government’s program, which the parliament voted for.
“The long-term vision of the government,” he said, is also necessary to attract investment and develop the economy.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Pashinyan promised after his return to Yerevan to start “negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary and non-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions of early elections.”
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the opposition Mr. Pashinyan of the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA).

Evkurov responded to oil claims of "fantasists"
The Ingushetian village of Dattih, where oil is allegedly planned, will not be transferred to Chechnya.
Yunus-Bek Evkurov, the head of Ingushetia, called the information fantasy, as there are 19 canned wells with high sulphur content near the Dattich field that do not allow oil to be extracted.
You have to invest 100 rubles to earn one ruble, Evkurov added.
Of the 19 mentioned wells, 16 are located in the territory of Ingushetia and are on the balance sheet of JSC "RN "Ingneft", reports "Interfax".
On September 26, Evkurov and the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov signed an agreement on the establishment of an administrative border between the regions, which clearly defines the borders for the first time since 1991.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, Russia’s theme was virtually absent in a negative way
The Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it can become a turning point in Russia’s perception as an integral participant in solving global problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, which we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia, has now been more muted,” the senator said in an interview published on Sunday.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation has sometimes "referred to as one of the three main threats to humanity, either along with the Ebola fever, or along with climate change or terrorism, Russia has been in this row, in any case, in the statement of the group of the country.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “Russia’s theme was virtually absent in a negative way”.
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the people were not exactly as much as the Russians", - pointed to the politicians, noting that Russia "is not a pain.
The head of the Board’s profile committee does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, “will allocate the current session [of the United Nations General Assembly], although this trend may fully manifest in a year, two, three years from now.”
“I do not rule out that the current session in some sense can be reversible,” Kosachev said, explaining that “too many examples of how Russia manages to move forward in international affairs with the connection.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be demanded over time,” he added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible – inseparable participant in solving the global problems of modernity”.
"I wouldn't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement will no longer be backwards, it will be forwards," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
"I attended a very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that, if a year or two or five years ago, I was interested in the Russian opinion.
In his view, this is due to the fact that "in the so-called new liberal order, which personifies with the West, there are no answers to questions how to solve world problems because of the obvious lack of ideas in the global space".
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that he considered in this sense "the current session to be successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that there will be no military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, said the head of the Foreign Ministry of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem.
According to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the removal of militants from the demilitarized zone in Idlib banned in Russia by the organization Jebhat al-Nusra, reports RIA Novosti.
The head of the foreign ministry also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in the event of the Kurds' aspiration for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create by October 15 a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry leads Chelsea's youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was conducting negotiations on the transition to the Moscow "Spartak".
As reported by RT with reference to Mirror, former England captain John Terry led the Chelsea youth team.
According to the source, the well-known player, who has been a part of the London club for a long time, will lead the team for no more than 23 years.

The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the convicted in the Russian Federation for the "spying" of the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for not having been able to free him so far.
She said this in a video address to a political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko FSB.
According to her, in these days under the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, a campaign is taking place, the participants of which declared a hunger protest with a demand to release the prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, who are starving, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and, of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interview, no matter where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin, and to put pressure on them with one demand - the liberation of Oleg, the liberation of Roman.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us "worse, tougher in defending Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil."
Ukrinform correspondent in France Roman Sushchenko was arrested by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage at the Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years of a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legal.
The Russian prisoners have satisfied the last request of the Ukrainian before he is staged into the colony.
NASA has reported the approximation of Earth asteroid the size of Big Ben

"Rostov-Arena" is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.
There were five tournament matches played on it.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Watching Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists tell about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the history of popular people's victories over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
The famous actor Wattang Kikabidze admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was given a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a conviction.
“I feel like a hammer hit my skull from below.
I fell.
He's lost his focus.
Put him in the hospital.
There the spoon could not hold, could not stand, fell all the time.
The tests started, it turned out, bad things, the artery does not pass blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they urgently had surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors behind the cyst saw the tumor," Kikabidze said in the program "Once Upon a Time".
The tumour was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol at the threshold of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow to bury the living actor, she firmly believed that she could cope with the disease and more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved husband.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive now.
“Whenever I had a critical situation, she was close to me like a rock,” he said.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he happily lives in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time he refutes the rumors about his illness, then about the timeless death that the case appears on the Net.
The creators of the site "Peacemaker" contributed to the "Cleaning" section of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Sijarto.
The occasion was “an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the foreign ministry of the neighbouring country was accused of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support of separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participation "in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violation by citizens of the legislation of Ukraine".
We would like to note that the deputy of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufry were pleased before the Siyarto in the "Clearness".
The reason for their opposition was to receive Tomos from the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Transcarpathia, the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
Authorities named the amount of "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
Simultaneous payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On State posts".
At the same time, the real amount of the "golden parachute" released from the position of the virio official was several times less than the amount expressed in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary for the occupied position of Agibalov is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, emphasized in the press service, the amount of the one-off payment amounted to 223,892 rubles minus the income tax, rather than 1 million rubles, about which the media wrote.
The official received an old-age pension from July 2018.
His internship in the state office is more than nine years.
The appointment of this pension and a one-time payment is made immediately after his dismissal, explained to the agency "RIA Novosti" in the regional government.
At the same time, the payment of Agibalov's supplement to the pension was suspended upon appointment to the state debt, and the amount of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
The winner of the elections of the governor of the Vrio governor of the region, Alexandra Gusev, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was dismissed from office due to the expiration of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held government posts in the region were terminated.
On September 29, Telegram-channel "Nezygar" published documents, from which it was supposed that Agibalov, who left the position of vice-governor, was paid a leave allowance in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days after that he received a similar position again without an adjunct.
State Duma MP urged to tell schoolchildren about the harm of masturbation
Onyshchenko holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Drawing on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that teens to masturbation provoke harmful information that they find on the internet.
Fighting this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennadiy Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Govorit Moscow":
As part of the general sexual education of children it is necessary to do this, explaining the harm, because here there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children comes early enough, and further there are large scissors between their sexual maturation and the opportunity to officially enter into intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is obstructed by "hangness", silence "the problem of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are confronted with masturbation.
The MP believes that to practice lessons on the harm of masturbation is primarily in schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood by you, to speak softly," he said.
Gennadiy Onishchenko is an active academician of RAMN, a member of the RAMN Presidium, a doctor of medical sciences, a professor.
Honored doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the presidium of the all-Russian public organization "League of Health of the Nation".

ADH became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
Apparently, the Germans began to get tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which made the country a leading target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most evident in recent social questions, according to which the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the ADH broke another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but at the same time the fact that the AdH, created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists, has managed to turn into a serious political force.
In general, the leadership is still holding the ruling bloc of the CIS/CIS, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points – back in April, support from Angela Merkel’s bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who leads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that following the Social Democrats were "green" (15%), left (11%) and liberal (10%).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was created in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government course, but at first only dealt with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and the interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsoring” of the EU’s weak economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country’s full exit from the EU.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADH has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the ADH managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 parliamentary seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternatives for Germany have won seats in the European Parliament.
Video published with a journalist, who called citizens of Ukraine "Nation of Bolvanov"
Leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books Ostap Drozdov on live, admitted that he considers his compatriots a "nation of Bolvanovs".
They believe in television and don’t read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been vaccinated since childhood in the culture of reading and accepting texts,” the journalist said.
The local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight against literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of up to 201 editions.

Canadians created a car in case of apocalypse - magazine Behind the wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions said it is already accepting applications for its new armoured vehicle.
Armored Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the subject of the apocalypse, money is made not only by video game makers, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche is being mastered by automotive companies as well.
For example, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its APC apocalypse armored vehicle.
In fantasy-free time, the engineers of this company create armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who do not have much comfort, but are safely housed in a fully-sealed armored capsule.
This bunker, or else the design will not be called, because its level of reservation corresponds to the standard B7, installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its base, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from subversion by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
The Apocalypse of the Roshel Senator APC
In order not to harm even the explosive wave from a broken shell near the car, the car’s lounge is equipped with special shock absorbing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire suppression system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a circular viewing camera system with night vision function, as well as a viewing armored tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.
Front of the Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armor Salon
To ensure that the weight of the armored car does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-litre heavy-duty turbodiesel engine with a volume of 6.7 liters, all the power of which is transferred to the front four-wheel-drive armored vehicle through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
The chances of getting stuck completely in the armory of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC no
The Roshel Senator APC apocalypse armor will be available at a specialised exhibition in Washington, D.C., in October.
Called the time of death of the universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of an international team of scientists has been published in the arXiv.org e-print library and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to such conclusions by using the HSC (Hyper Supprime-Cam) telescope of Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the observed world’s mass energy, scientists working within the standard cosmological model of LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter) have estimated the expansion rate of the universe, which was a little slower.
In a press release from the Subaru Observatory, it is noted that the observations allowed for a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the account of the data of the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limitations imposed on LCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Breakup.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum has failed
The opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
In Moscow on Saturday, a meeting of the all-federal initiative group of the referendum against the increase of the retirement age was held.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, which registered different wordings of issues (in total, the Centre compiler registered five wordings).
They decided to apply to the CEC with an application for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favour of having the age of 1 July 2018 established by the legislation on pension provision, on the basis of which the citizens of Russia are not entitled to be appointed?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, the representatives of which did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally capable.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Just Russia" Ilya Sviridova (six subgroups) and the KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told "Vedomosti" that the invitations were sent to all the initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the head of the Vologda subgroup (its formulation was supported by 15 other subgroups), told "Vedomostim" that the invitations did not receive and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy."

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" Turbine's mistakes broke out, like from the horn of abundance
Former All-Union judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbine in the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotive" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the trial of Evgeny Turbine in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
"I believe that this referee has confirmed his inability to referee matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the efforts in the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbine nor the DSI leaders made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down to come to the ninth round: errors in his actions, private gaps of rough practices broke out like from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the Eder railway collapses with the help of hands in its penalty area defender "Akhmat" Rodolfo.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbine doesn't set a penalty.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idov, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball had fallen into his hand?
- I think there was a deliberate play by the hand of a defender in my penalty area.
Turbine was close to the moment, can see the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore, the account in the match is distorted, and sports justice has turned out to be cheap.
It was the same case where the conceptual judgment pushed out and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he demonstrably applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second "peanut"?
"At that moment, Turbine and the first yellow card did not show the case at all.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of the trial that some teams are put on penalties for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
That's what we mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge looks at who is playing.
He played on Saturday at Lokomotiv and Ahmat has serious complaints about Turbine's work because the team was injured.
Matt Damon played the accused in the rape of Judge Cavano at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at the Senate hearings on charges of rape.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court has previously drawn attention to his emotionality and the detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Thus, Kavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but stated that he never drank until he was memorable.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on rape charges, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin during those years.
These moments were also won by Damon.
I just did a lot of drinking and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone is familiar with this,” said Judge Matt Damon in his performance.
Kavanaugh was previously elected Supreme Court Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand has discovered strangeness in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand has said that the clones of her dead dog behaved quite differently than the original pet.
"They don't look like them.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it’s impossible to clone the soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog Coton de Tolear named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a dog of the chihuahua breed called Miracle Milly, which was called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The U.S. is considering a maritime blockade of Russia due to oil and gas supplies
In the United States, Russia’s maritime blockade may begin to gain an advantage on the world energy market.
The U.S. authorities have so vehemently fought for success in the world market of hydrocarbons that they are ready to resort to the maritime blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s major energy suppliers.
The possibility of a maritime blockade was announced by the head of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to global practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not carry out police, but civilian functions, including the implementation of policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement came within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. naval forces, they control the seaways in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke’s words showed that the need may be related to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives a lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to allocate energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s revitalization in this region, Zinke is confident.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to provide itself with leadership in the world market of energy resources, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be put into serial production
The mass production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the general director of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute Zhukovsky Kirill Spialo.
According to him, the scientific center is conducting work on ultrasonic themes both within international consortia and in cooperation with the Ministry of Trade.
“We feel that it will take us two or three years to get a technology demonstrator, and another 10-15 years to get a serial machine that allows us to carry out transportation through the spaces of our homeland,” he added.
He clarified that now before Russian specialists is the question of how to make the technique economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the developer of aviation equipment PJSC Tupolev announced the completion of pre-designed works on supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to develop speeds up to 1900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Deputy Director General of the company Valery Solozobov.
The President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko thanked the President of Russia Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
That’s what he said on CNN.
He said he could only confirm the words of the Washington Post columnist that the result of Putin’s aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.
“In 2013, transatlantic integration of Ukraine, NATO membership supported 16% of Ukrainians.
That’s more than 54% now.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine, accession to the EU was supported by 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.
Who did this?
Putin," Poroshenko said.
Therefore, thank you, Mr Putin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire," the President of Ukraine stressed.
In late September 2018, President Petro Poroshenko was in the United States and took part in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of a great friend of Ukraine, U.S. Senator John McCain (1987-2018).

Formula 1 Grand Prix of the Russian Federation
In Russia, there is a club that I follow.
Former Chelsea captain and England team John Terry - about why he visited the game of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I’ve been watching it recently and I’ve been interested in looking at it from the side.
“I can’t say I’m a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a lot of sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize once again for the decision,” Terry said.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" was in the fifth row, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white on the 7th of October will play with Eniseem, and Valery Karpin's successors will take Orenburg the day before.
Precious violin handed over to the barber for priceless
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan bar in Somerville, Massachusetts, the bartender offered only $50 for what looked like an old and unpretentious tool.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old-fashioned and expensive tool, and consulted an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galiano and is estimated at $250,000.
Only strings to the violin are estimated at $16-18 thousand.
The investigation found that the violin had been kidnapped by one of the residents of the city not so long ago, and the instrument was returned to the legal owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the man who gave it to the barber, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now everyone bringing the violin to the bar will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL awaits us an exciting confrontation: Spartak will receive at his stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as is known, not a foreign "people's team".
The peculiarity of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, away from the far jumping "Zenita" and being in one point from "Krasnodar".
The red-and-whites now have a difficult track: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, Massimo Carrera’s team unexpectedly flew in “Rapid”, and recently gave up at home “Akhmat”.
After the derby with the CSKA, which ended in a fair zero, Spartak with a minimum account and not without difficulty won in the Cup "Chernomorets", and it is too early to talk about whether Russia's most popular club is approaching the exit from the crisis.
Rostov could not win three games in a row, but he does not know the defeats already five games.
Let’s see if Karpin can extend the winless series with such a game as fundamental for himself.
The previous meeting of the Carpathian "Rostova" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia rocked by aftershocks after powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where a few days ago there was an earthquake that provoked a three-metre tsunami, meteorologists observed more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reports the TV channel "Russia 24".
The death toll exceeded 420 people and more than 500 people were injured.
The authorities notified the population of the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled it.
The fact is that the devices did not record the approaching wave.
So far, the fate of dozens of residents who were preparing to celebrate the national holiday on one of the waterfront cities of Palu, which was most affected by destruction after nature, is unknown.
London has aggrieved the charges against Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party’s congress in Birmingham.
Threats are increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies are operating in gray areas with cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have repeatedly been refuted by Moscow, reports TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Foreign Ministry Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year, former GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage in favor of Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO is held, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of renaming the republic to North Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are monitored by international organizations.
Jan Petersen, Head of the Monitoring Mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews how the work of observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams traveled around the country to monitor the entire process today, from the opening of the polling stations to their closure, then counting the votes and drawing up the protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparation for the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgari: “About 500 foreign observers are closely watching the vote.
The groups of observers record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions to then present them in the final report.”
The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and the Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in mutual understanding.
This was announced on International Translator’s Day, September 30, by professional synchronist translator Berbel Sachs.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "tighten to go quickly."
But it seems to me that for understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role," the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know the history".
And in the future, Saxe noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to "engage" relations with Russia and support them.
According to her, for Berlin mania is particularly important project of the gas pipeline "Northern Stream - 2", which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today
The head coach "Vitya" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"My colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to note our fans," Belova said on the official website of Vitazya.
“I hope they will also support it, because now almost every game is full of stadiums, a great atmosphere.
In the game, God probably helped the Siberians today, because they made a very gross mistake, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost the micro - match 0:3 our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
But I'm still going to take the blame.
Because they seem to have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last game, it was a different team.”
"It's a nasty scoundrel."
Viewers are outraged by Agutin's choice for the "Voice" show
The viewers of the show "Voice 60<0x2B>" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "impotent smearing and numbness".
When in blind auditions he learned from the first note the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But boyish feelings took over, and he chose a relative in his team.
At the time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor for the unobjectiveness in the first stage.
But the "joke" was prolonged, and the star's father completely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the spectators are not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the show’s viewers, were outraged by the ugly and frank pulling of our close relatives on the final staircase.
I have already doubted that Agutin has enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end to the first place at all," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina said in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "smeared" wonderful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovitch whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by what viewers still want to see in his father's show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, viewers want an objective assessment and to see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I feel for the members of the Voice of Agutin team - they were doomed."
“Last time Agutin showed him how much he loved his dad, and today he had to show himself professional.”
“The competition has lost its meaning.”
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project your dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you then call the mentor?",
“If you like the way Dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
“It was unprofessional on Agutin’s part.”
"Then you have to offer to perform on your own show to dad, not on a show that is made for the money of 1 Channel."
“It was a real opportunity for someone, and it took someone’s place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless pope should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was a worker from Surgut splattered with a magnificent voice and a timbrel, and Pope Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
Because you can't get through the mess!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
A circle of mud and mud.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of absurdity continues!
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" the son of Gradsky came out on blind auditions.
Then the meter didn't come to my head to take my son to his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin could not act as a professional.

"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed for the study of cosmic sources of radiation," added Petrukovich.

Russian pilot "Williams" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the race Grand Prix of Russia.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I was between two cars that immediately hit me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, at the moment, right away.
He was in a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us went to the pit stop, we would get into the “clean air” and the pace would return, but the rubbers were gone.
Plus he fought with his partner, he also had contact with him.
As I understand it, he was a little wrong.
We were in a situation like this on the most uncrowded track of the season, I couldn’t do anything and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore", - brings the words of the orphan RIA "Novosti".

The President of the Tennis Federation of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishev commented on the removal of the players of the Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrey Yeshchenko from the trainings with the main team after the match against the criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Karsimo.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Paying attention to such things is unworldly stupidity.
I completely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the disintegration of the team.
First of all, these are poems, to read and perceive them as you wish.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be proud.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko put the likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
This is not a normal climate for the team.
Today, Spartacus does not have a game, so this situation did not need to inflate at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at this together.
Spartak has a lot of things wrong in different lines, there is inactivity after the introduction of youth.
The relations within the team, it seems, do not add optimism before this match," - Tarpishev is sure.
The game will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who previously rejected Spartacus, led the Chelsea youth team.
Students of "Sirius" discussed with scientists natural-like technologies
Students of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatovsky Institute".
The presentation of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Nature-Similar Technologies, organized in Sochi by the order of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, reported on the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, RAN correspondent member Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the website "Sirius".
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, which young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arises when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies, it is the improvement of the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is the other side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of systems of living nature.
There is a reverse side - intentional interference in the life activities of a person.
There is always risk.
A car appeared – people began to die under the wheels.
The cars are still being used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," - quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physico-mathematical sciences, the head of the NBIKS-nature-like technologies complex of NIC "Kurchatovsky Institute" Yulia Dyakova and the head of the NBIKS-technologies complex Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius educational center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success educational foundation based on the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the work of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online information security Olympiad Cybervyzov will be sent to training in Sirius.

Kemerovchan outraged herd of sheep at cemetery
On September 30, a message appeared on the well-known Kemerovska page on the social network from an eyewitness that one of the local cemeteries is free to walk horned animals.
The animals walked between the fences and picked up the grass.
The commentators expressed different opinions: some of the local residents noted that in the presence of a small horned animal in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in the cleaning of the territory of the habitats from the weeds and the weeds of the grass: however, some of them
"It's a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for the sheep to do there.
Of course you won’t say about the lambs, but that’s not the case,” the angry Kemerovchanka said in her message.
Either way, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
Toss and toss – how to do it?
There is no word for pressure.
That's right, take it.
The word "pressure" in the sense of "to drag, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "to handle".
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word “pressure.”
But “pressure” and “to bear” etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Make sure of that yourself.
Dovet (Circ.-book, outdated) - means "enough, full, enough, enough to be enough for anyone or anything, to satisfy".
Satisfaction, pleasure are related words.
Previously it had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have a self-satisfying meaning" - "to satisfy oneself".
Old Slavic "d<0xC3><0xB3>vl<0xC5><0xA1>ti" is related to the words "government" and "will".
To give, to suppress, is completely different.
These words have truly terrifying "relatives": daos - "wolf" (drinking sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to disturb".
A similar phonetic form of the words "pressure" and "to cope", as well as the inevitable aging of the latter, forced them into contamination.
So we came up with this very "d[a]t", which is used in the letter through "a", which is, well, wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, it's right to take it.
But this word is outdated, in its proper sense no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from the top, use the word “press”.
You can also use the "show pressure" design, but remember that it is a office.

With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia defended itself from terrorists
In the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 were killed by Russian air and space forces.
This was said on the occasion of the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the VKS, the head of the Committee of the Federation Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of defeat from the air: the air and space forces have inflicted and continue to inflict all attacks precisely on the targets of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, in three years, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria - we are talking about, for example, ammunition warehouses, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - this became a crucial contribution to the promotion of government troops in Syria, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS) (prohibited in Russia) and the Jabhat-an-Nusra (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of ISIS fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
And it is only about the registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at the far borders – otherwise this evil “would be barking at us”.

Syria Accuses U.S. of Supporting Terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem has accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it has committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
“These killings under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” as the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant “seeding chaos, death and destruction on their way.”
The head of the foreign ministry also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost completed, and the country has become safer and more stable.

The United States rejected all charges.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on Hungary’s issuance of its passports in Transcarpathia.
Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other countries, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are – in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to send the consul of that country from Beregovo.
“I fully share every letter that has been said by the Foreign Ministry,” the President said.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of extradition of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Consulate of Hungary in Beregovo.
At the same time, they solemnly swore allegiance to Hungary.

However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.

More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict, which has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people have fled to other countries, primarily to neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the military action is nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Valid al-Muallem told the UN: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and safer thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues its reconstruction work in areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that complicate people’s lives and deprive them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the world community to contribute to and allocate funds for the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide aid to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen fully admitted its guilt in the "dieselgate" in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the company’s U.S. division, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The Group’s losses are estimated at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 billion.
This amount does not include only fines and compensation.
By June next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the management of the company said that the commitments are already fulfilled in relation to 83% of the cars, so the program will be completed early.
“Folkswagen” fully tries to compensate for the losses and restore the trust of the customers.
Thus, the management of the group was recently changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system were announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this right was granted by the authorities in February of this year.

Metropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev’s decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is not the same as in fascist Germany to label a Jew with a yellow edged star, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose this bill was created," the Metropolitan told the TV channel "Russia-24".
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UOC and “put it out of the law,” the clergyman believes.
“This is the Ukrainian church, and those who believe in this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter suggests the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.

The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the residence.
At different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives of faith and spirit, Christians had to profess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has arisen, and the information that we have at our disposal, and the threats of abuse that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The Deputy Lavra also stressed that it is likely that “your physical presence will be needed.”
The clergyman added: “Lenin’s grandsons are in spirit, threatened with corruption, and therefore we will protect our sanctuary.”
Whoever does not care about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra – the Orthodox Ukrainian and World Sanctuary, must be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go about the cause of those who mislead the believers.
The UOC has a canonical status as determined by Thomas of October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to add to the dependence of the novelty patriarch and the friend of the Catholic pope of Rome Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are happy with the status that our church has," said the deputy lavra.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its administration.
There is no administrative-financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomas already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether there are other Tomos denominations, whether they are independent from the Vatican.
The believers were in a state of disrepute and determined in what temple they should walk.
However, someone wants to sow hostility and quarrels again.
Some people are jealous that they are shining the dome on the temples they want to destroy,” the priest said.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaevska mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical accounts of it date back to the beginning of the 13th century.

If we continue to play correctly, the wins will come.
The head coach of Moscow "Dynamo" Vladimir Vorobyev - about the defeat of "Automobilist" (0:1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"The game was good, interesting, although it went to the goal," said Vorobyev on the official website "Automobilista".
"We tried to play very simple.
I really liked the first period.
I didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent pushed us a little, we resisted.
But removing us was a bit "feedy."
The guys played great, performed the coaching setup.
I think if we continue to play right, the wins will come.
No goals scored, with zero goals the game is not won, but the content of the game itself was correct.
We will be lucky if we continue to play in that direction.”
"In your opinion, "Automobilist" added in comparison with the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“I didn’t play a foreign team.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other tasks, played many young boys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
"Car driver" is a good good team.
From the tournament table, it is clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
A good defense, a good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work.”

U.S. Increases Opiate Production in Afghanistan
There was a lot of talk about the sharp exacerbation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants have launched a real terrorist war against the organs of state power and the peaceful population of the country.
This year has become a record number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans died,” Patrushev said.
The war in Afghanistan did not begin at all yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States was declared the main enemy of the terrorist group “Al Qaeda” (prohibited in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Not a month has passed since the United States and NATO allies began military operation “Unbreakable Freedom”.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops have been driven past the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, buy from the militants for money - only if they were not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller portion of the country’s territory – 40 percent, Patrushev said.
50% - in the movement "Taliban" (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they are growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia – exactly what they failed to achieve in Iraq and Syria.
America, it seems, is okay.
In the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
Colossal growth of the areas planted with opium poppies and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its neighbour as a neighbour of the country and its northern neighbour as a right to be called Macedonia, as a country.
Ljupko Petkovsky, a political scientist: “Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
Greece has the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy at all.”
The renaming of the country is supported by the ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the country's president George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist regime led by Zayev is forced from outside the topic.
This decision, however, will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
“Obviously there are countries that don’t want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgari, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine not only the future of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.”

A new picture of Georges Lantimos was shown at a film festival in New York.
The historical drama tells about subversive intrigues during the reign of Queen Anna, the last monarch of the Stewart dynasty.
It stars Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weiss, Emma Stone, and Nicholas Holt.
“The script turned out to be tiring and brilliant, Jorgos himself is funny and very talented.
And, of course, casting.
All in all, the purest happiest merger of circumstances!” says Emma Stone.
“It often happens that you come home, you are asked, ‘Well, how did you work?’ and you say, ‘Imagine I threw an orange-naked man away.’
It’s a non-standard job, isn’t it?” adds Nicholas Holt.
The international premiere of the film took place at the 75th Venice Festival.
In the US, "Favoritka" will be released in November, and in Russia, it will appear on screens in January next year.
