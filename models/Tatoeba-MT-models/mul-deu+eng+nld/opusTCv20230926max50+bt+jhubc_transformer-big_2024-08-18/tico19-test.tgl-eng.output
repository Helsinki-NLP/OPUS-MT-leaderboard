The combined incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The combined incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows similar targets in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and in the United Kingdom which proves that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who need health care, and intensive care in particular.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia unknown in the field of aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Because, the disease that results from the SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far is that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more serious illness that requires hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases experience a critical illness that requires serious care.
The death rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the combined COVID-19 events in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and in the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries in Italy on 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries
Following China, COVID-19 has undergone an additional geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following in the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On the issue of Eurosurveillance 2020 on 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported in the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed Europe according to the WHO definition of the case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported in all 30 countries in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), with between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting the Combined Number and Combined Incidents of COVID-19 Cases
In the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the declared case of COVID-19 in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, is delivered every 8 hours.
These data were used for the assessment of COVID-19 targets in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compared to those in Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the 14 days of cut-to-cut combined incidents of cases of COVID-19, so the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and UK, is thus considered.
We also show the combined number of cases reported by each country on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared to those in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
The 14-day non-consecutive combined incidents of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK are generally followed by those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the combined COVID-19 event began to rise on 21 February and then rose rapidly on 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
It is mostly the source of a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK have shown the same increasing direction of the combined COVID-19 incident (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to Italy over the period 31 January – 15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as of March 15 8:00 a.m., 15 other countries in the EU/EEA and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy in the previous 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of declared COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed goals in the combined COVID-19 incident suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
It is even at different stages in countries, there are differences in national public health responses, and possible different case definitions in countries and different protocols in the selection of patients to be examined for confirmation of COVID-19, including a follow-up examination.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed serious care and the media reported that hospitals and units of serious care in the regions were their deadliest.
Data on the entry of COVID-19 cases into a hospital and/or unit of intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, according to the citation (data not shown).
However, they must be collected in a systematic way to add to the current disclosure data focused on the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a large difference in the availability of intensive care and mid-care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 population in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Due to the combined cases of today's several regions in the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units (intensive care units) usually serve a specific number of populations, the statistical data on NU cases and beds must be used in NU cases.
Experience in Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the scenario of long-term transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need care, and in particular intensive care in Italy.
As stated in the ECDC's recent rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential for delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, when there is a shift from toxicity (containment) to toxicity (mitigation), as expected.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the severe impact of the pandemic.
There is a short gap of opportunity where countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
Failing this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The spread of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in disaster for humans.
Similar to its similar virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, can also transfer SARS-CoV-2 from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more likely to spread and affect more elderly individuals than adolescents and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on developing disease, this article is trying to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will develop basic knowledge on epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the impending disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became unprecedented and unforgettable to all Chinese who were persuaded to stay indoors throughout the holiday and for many weeks after due to the spread of a new disease from the virus.
The virus was highly similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV-19 Disease (COV-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 others around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients homebound and more than 3,000 patients dead.
"WHO recalls that COVID-19 is ""the number 1 public enemy"" and possibly stronger than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including microbial studies, follow-up lessons on the epidemic, origins, diagnosis, and first treatment since 2020.
This review is trying to curb the development of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a prevalence in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the prevention and analysis of the disease as well as some remaining but immediate questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, which primarily cause about 15% of common chickenpox 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered high pathogenic CoV people, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which led to a spread that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the morphology, and soon spread to many others.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third prevalence of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Fig. As shown in Fig.1,1, pneumonia clusters of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly in nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, the infection of health care providers was reported, proposing a possible human-to-human transfer.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down with the banning of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan that was considered the source site of infection from the unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the spread of a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2) .2). (Fig. 2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the extent and severity of the spread remains even more certain.
As of February 11, 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients showed a more timely description of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-Aq-HX_rX).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but mostly between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected individuals are over 50 years old, few are younger than 20, and only 14 infected individuals are younger than 10 years old.
More men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000) have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Covid-19 has spread mainly and around Hubei.
COVID-19 lasts on average 5 (2-9) days from the start to the diagnosis.
The average incubation time was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average duration from baseline to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people has risen exponentially rapidly before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of mass travel before China's Spring Festival.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all the patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are subfamily of large, packed viruses that contain single strands of sense RNA.
They can be classified into four categories, hal., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, where alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to be toxic to humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA together with the packaged glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virions containing virions, which then bind to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity in 10 consecutive samples collected from the original prevalence site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in excessively thin sections of the epithelium in the human airway.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which at the same time causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the release of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not have any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM whole human structure ACE2 at 2.9 A resolution with amino acid transporter B0AT 1.
They found that the complex, with open and closed formations, was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex was able to bind two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment target for drug sedation to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host.
It was found that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transferred to humans by mice and camels, according to the researchers.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two male-SARS CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVX21.
However, it remains unknown what intermediate host helped the virus to cross the species barriers for human access, and the route of transmission should still be clarified.
Ji, et al., suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to people involved in the re-entry of the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that long-tailed, bird-eating mammals that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of the genetics of a species.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a large difference; thus, the conclusive results for concrete evidence are expected (Fig. (Fig. 33). (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical components of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been determined on average.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heats at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectant containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore easily mastered by the new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only consult previous studies of other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4) .4). (Fig.4).
In general, after a virus attacks the host, it is first identified by the host innate immune system by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) along with C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-R-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus initiates the appearance of causes of inflammation, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus disappear from immune responses.
As soon as possible, adaptive immune responses are included in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes along with CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to make antibodies specifically to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help defender cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell activation by initiating the death of T cells.
Humoral immunity including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies that are separated from the cure neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system creates a large number of free radicals in the area so it can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, smothering many organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by clustering at the beginning, is more likely to affect the elderly with comorbidities and pregnancies.
Typically people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or compromised immune functions, have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, often 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, one study in 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to regulate the effective time of quarantine based on the most accurate time of incubation, to prevent infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a normal activity, individuals exposed to, or infected with, viruses usually need to be quarantined within 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Common primary and initial symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dryness, nausea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, fluid retention in the nose, chest pain, dizziness, dizziness.
Some patients experienced numbness and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly progressed to the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and chronic fever, even without abnormalities in the lung image, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for sneezing, and 3% for sneezing; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies in a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an individual asymptomatic.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dizziness (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and are in line with higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dizziness (40%-42%), vomiting (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the death toll from COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the rate of SARS deaths in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
One previous study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence gap (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 of SARS-CoV only reached 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to their symptoms, postmortem, and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the last two.
Thus, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The cumulative beginning often occurs in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that the virus can hold people without symptoms for longer than two weeks and recovered patients who have been discharged to hospitals may again have the virus, which provides an alarm for prolonged quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
As an example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts of 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with lymphocyte counts of 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin are increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation is increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, is increased, and the number of lymphocytes is gradually decreased.
Abnormalities in chest x-rays are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, chronic lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis seriously compromises the gas exchange.
The malfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes lowers the level of the surfactant and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung delivery.
Therefore, the worst-known x-rays in the chest are often associated with the strictest limits of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first analysis of the cause of COVID-19 showed the spread of pneumocytes, formation of mucous membranes, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the diseaseRSME and pulmonary disease, respectively.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) in China began on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation has also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and necessary in making an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which matches the synthesized SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments with a single mass of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L.
It is expected that the new method will significantly increase sensitivity and comfort when applied to clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience in the new CoV, physicians may provide primary care support to COVID-19 patients; while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or previously recommended for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and other MERS-Vs.
These treatments include current and potential treatments of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from healthy patients, Chinese medications, and psychological support.
Even the plasma from the recovered patients is recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are leading the way to develop antibodies and vaccines against microbes.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the onset and is also likely to attack, at a lower level, other organs that express ACE2, such as the intestinal system and stones.
However, malfunctioning and shortness of breath are the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives and with general oxygen treatment, high oxygen flow, incapacitated ventilation, and incapacitated de-machine ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory bypass.
In addition, maintaining the electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting the functions of important organs are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been found that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the immune cells to release many free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and suffocation of many organs.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not beneficial in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution for COVID-19 patients with critical illness.
At the time of writing, no effective treatment against the virus was confirmed.
However, root administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
A new antiviral drug Remdesivir was first developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed possible suppression of other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead gave the compound to China to carry out a pair of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are expected to the majority.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as potential therapies for patients with chronic respiratory symptoms.
Vomiting, dizziness, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur following concomitant treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from Healing Patients and Creation of Antibody
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have suffered from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the ailment of the disease has a long history.
Indeed, healthy patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the cause of the disease in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight the causes of the disease and other foreign objects and they recognize the unique molecules in the causes of the disease and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and infected 10 patients with the disease seriously.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and load viruses and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, clarification and clarification are required to suggest a method for large-scale use before particular therapies are further developed.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overly stimulate the immune response and lead to cytokine release syndrome, which is a potential life-threatening disorder.
Normally the concentration of antibodies in the blood is low, and there is a high need for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and make particular antibodies at a high enough rate to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from healthy patients and identify the encoding of genetic codes of effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against important virus proteins.
In this way, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend mainly on a combination of many components in a formula that differs depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most of the effective ingredients remain unclear or obscure because it is difficult to pick up and replicate the said ingredients or their best combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and particular therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those recovering from severe periods.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The top rates of cure in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in some provinces in China using TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia's highest (50%), and Hunan's highest (50%), while the province of Hubei's COV had approximately 30%, while the province of Hubei's only 30% of patients used TCM.
However, this comparison is somewhat rough because there are many other reasons for strong effects such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine (WM) only to the treatment involved with WM and TCM.
They found that the times required for recovery of body temperature, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization were significantly shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most strikingly, the number of symptomatic depressions (from mild to severe) was noticeably lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the validity and safety of TCM is still waiting for tests that are well-controlled and broader scales and in more centers.
It is also intriguing to characterize the mechanism of action and explore the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience the vast majority of fears of highly contagious and lethal diseases, and people who are quarantined also experience fatigue, sadness, and anger.
What's more, symptoms of infection such as fever, lack of oxygen reaching the tissues or hypoxia, and cough as well as the adverse effects of treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and anxiety.
In the early stages of SARS prevalence, a number of psychiatric morbidities have been reported including ongoing depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, detachment, and suicide.
Forced contact and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the spread of COVID-19, can cause people to be more concerned and consensual about the effects of comfort, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to COVID-19 patients, suspect individuals, and people who interact with them as well as to the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate timings about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid contact with close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for stopping the chain of transmission from pregnant animals and infected people to easy-to-use hosts and often assist in antiviral treatment in controlling the epidemics caused by the developing viruses.
Efforts were made to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection has not yet been determined prior to the start of a clinical study.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic MERS cases and clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continuous zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS through the use of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, particulate mala-viruses and recombinant protein subunits and analyzed some of the animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an immediate and critical task for controlling the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the hardship due to the long-term (which will last up to 18 months) that it takes to develop the vaccine and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical course to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover slowly without a sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high rates of illness and death in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, developing a model of prognosis for the disease is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Prevalence (Prevalence33):(Table33):
Age: Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mainly at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than those who are not (at median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require close care are more likely to suffer from chronic cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiovascular events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also excrete ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver malfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is very important to remember that age and hidden diseases are strongly related and can be disruptive to each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and is suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and complete recovery.
The correlation of the level of CRP with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely shown in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue breakdown.
They are, therefore, a traditional remedy for heart or liver malfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Major clinical symptoms: The x-ray of the chest and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered among other issues for predicting the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for contagious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
Because a high dose of corticosteroids is widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: Stress in the mind: As described above, in the prevalence of COVID-19 many patients suffer from unusual stress because they often suffer long periods of quarantine and severe uncertainty and have witnessed the deaths of close family members and both the patient.
It is important to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, SARS seems to have different epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19.
In addition to copying the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively increase the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common clots.
Therefore, infected patients at the early stage or time of incubation can develop a large number of viruses during daily activity, which causes significant difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transfer is considered to have occurred when patients are seriously ill, as most of the transfer did not occur in the first part.
Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is more severe and difficult to control than the spread of SARS.
Huge efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of nearly the entire population in hopes of cutting off the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been severely detrimental to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has declined, indicating a decline in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the spread will end at the end of March and the relaxation will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., argues that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could account for two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been observed in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be a cyclical flu-like episode.
However, signs have occurred in China based on the decreasing number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually prevented.
Possibly similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become weaker in relief and eventually die or be a virus that reduces the disease that lives with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55). (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is fully transmitted by coughing or smearing, and can also be through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in debris, which adds a new possibility of digestion from the debris into the mouth.
A new study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were likely to be caused by infections from the hospital, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, care should be taken to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, peers, and even watchers of patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the materials, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV and n85 is about the same size.
Because particles can penetrate even into five layered surgical masks, health care providers who interact directly with patients should wear N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear quadrupled insulation gowns to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also be transmitted to an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus could enter his body through his swollen eyes.
Therefore, health-care providers should also wear clear face shields or protective shields while working with patients.
For the general public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that everyone should wash their hands with disinfecting soaps more often than before, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potential immigrants.
The three feet are considered to be a suitable distance for intermittent contact with people from a patient.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has been transferred as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 should have triggered high alerts in China based on its deep memory of the spread of SARS in 2003.
However, it wasn't until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed the citizens by saying that the new virus had low relief and limited human-to-human growth and was not a problem to prevent and prevent the disease.
This message has remarkably calmed the public's alarm, especially as the entire country prepares for the Spring Festival, and exceeded the critical opportunity to prevent the disease at its lowest level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may consider this difficult lesson and make critical improvements in the future. . . .
For example, these agencies should be able to communicate freely and publicly (1) be more careful when making public announcements because each word is important to the public and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be able to communicate more sensitively and more reactively to information from clinics than to communicate publicly.
The spread of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Because SARS-CoV is almost identical to the virus and also has the same symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some amazing differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than adolescents and more men than women, and the severity and rate of death is also higher in older individuals than in adolescents.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even if they have no symptoms while SARS patients usually do so when their disease is severe, causing more difficulty in preventing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
It explains a little why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assays for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can be re-positive with the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
Due to the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, some critical issues remain to be addressed, such as the following:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homolog was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS panic CoVs, we still can't confirm that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
To what animal will the intermediate species transfer the virus from the original host, let's say, bats, to humans?
We don't know the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't effectively cut off the move, and the spread can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly did the virus penetrate airway cells and cause the resulting pathological changes?
Does the virus also excrete cells that express ACE2 to other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus develop during human transmission?
Will it be a pandemic around the world, disappearing like SARS or returning from time to time like the flu?
This is important but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, no matter what may be asked for in return, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the joint evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were identified to be suffering from mild illness, such as common chickenpox.
The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed how contagious and life-threatening the HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put CoVs on notice again and we were surprised by its rapid transfer but reduced pathogenicity or disease-causing compared to its SARS-CoV brother.
The HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs will serve us well.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they do not cause disease (pathogens).
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Referring to animal hosts has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of CoV-host interactions with animals can also gain an important insight into human CoV pathogenesis.
In this review, we show a general view of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a study of the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and migrations to the species.
What is important, we compare and distinguish different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current CoV 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transfers and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also focused.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, consisting of a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses cover the largest genome that 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses have been called ""CoVs"" because of their corona-like morphology under the electron microscope."
In structure, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar structure.
An estimated two-thirds of the genome contains two large combined open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are more processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of particular lines of accessory proteins are also encoded by various CoV lines.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV gene contains the most HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A , B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodent genes are the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary storehouse of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continued to cross the boundaries of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
At present, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Of these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 typically experience mild symptoms, such as common colds and/or vomiting.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the tail of patients with common tail in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept is widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is usually not harmful until the SARS outbreak.
The spread of SARS that occurred in 2003 was one of the most persistent in the current history, affecting more than 8,000 people with an initial death rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has led to an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that has been rampant worldwide.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), then renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the cause of the 2019 ongoing coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives and cured more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice or pets.
Many lines of evidence support an evolution that originates all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well suited and not pathogenic but show a good genetic difference.
The COVID-19 epidemic has shown great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and around the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, causes and factors of restriction of migration to species.
It can also guide or speed up the search for SARS-CoV-2 storage, intermediate and potentiation hosts, with important implications for preventing future spreads.
In this review we show a general view of zoonotic origins, transfer between species and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we focus on and discuss the common theme that parent HCoV viruses are usually non-pathogenic to their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after remediation between species in a new host.
We also examine the course of evolution of HCoV where the rate of transfer (transmissibility) is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity or cause of disease.
The outcome of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 has also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Prior to the first separation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nose juice of patients who had common sputum, various CoVs were isolated from various infected animals, including foxes, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and later contracted to grow in the lung cell lines of WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed common sputum symptoms, including headache, dizziness, nausea and throat swelling, with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial transfer to the brains of rat infants.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the causes of HCoV-229E, the symptoms of which cannot be determined from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world, and they are likely to be transferred during winter to medium-sized climates.
Often, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately 2-week illness.
According to a study in human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E had a mild common cold.
Only a few of the immunocompromised patients showed severe infection in the lower respiratory tract.
"SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia", is the first well documented cause of the HCoV pandemic in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered."
The first case of SARS could be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
In addition to the severe spreaders, it was estimated that each case could lead to approximately two second cases, with a starting or incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the viral load outbreak appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially seen with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and tremors, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as last symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver function tests, and an increase in creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Disruption of diffuse alveolar, spread of epithelial cells and elevation of macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later on require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower part of the respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in this more serious case, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal especially in patients with poor resistance to the disease.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of a prospective patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, the effort has focused on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first found to be widespread in children, the elderly and patients who are weak in the fight against disease with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nose specimen from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is referred to in the Netherlands, in fact it is spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 consists of approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its spread occurs in the early part of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with developing throat disease, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the presence of pneumonia and bronchiolitis available in the community, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with chronic hives exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCoVs obtained in the community are well suited to humans and in general are more likely not to mutate to cause high pathogenic diseases, even if accidents occur only for unknown reasons such as pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary tum.
Often, when these HCoVs have the ability to spread rapidly and remain continuously in humans, their virulence or pathogenicity is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had chronic pneumonia and kidney stones in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases confirmed in the lab come from the Middle East, import cases with occasional second-degree spread in close relationships have been reported in various countries in Europe and Tunisia.
Another second spread occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by progressive chronic pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop chronic rock dysplasia, which is now unique for MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory cases have been confirmed with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, the ranges of pneumonia patients who were to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has announced the continued spread of the infection to the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency that will affect the World Wide Web (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) and has also called the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with an estimated death rate of 3.4%.
Interestingly, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the outside rate is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are seen as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Diarrhoea has also been seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can develop rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are almost identical due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are aligned with different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transferable than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects or subjects who do not show symptoms infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and classification of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals striking similarities and differences.
First, the time of incubation or hatching of the egg and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are almost the same.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 remains between SARS-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs (ie HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics that are more commonly seen during infection in those infected with community HCoVs, including reporting non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also shows remarkable patterns of quality of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs obtained in the community.
On the one hand, the ability to transfer SARS-CoV-2 is equivalent to those obtained by HCoV in the community.
On the other hand, it remains necessary to determine whether the ability to transfer SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transmissions such as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 may be referred to in waste samples.
If easing from the dirt to the mouth (fecal-oral transmission) SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstances, future studies remain to be explored.
It is also noteworthy to see if SARS-CoV-2 may show a periodicity such as in cases of acquired HCoVs in the community.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 along with its ability to transfer, pathogenicity and persistence after human transfers can influence the final fate of the continued spread of COVID-19.
All four HCoVs obtained in the community that cause mild symptoms are well suited to people.
From another perspective, it can also be true that people are well suited to these four HCoVs.
In a nutshell, both may have originated from the early HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and the person who has developed severe HCoV disease have already been removed.
In order to do this, HCoVs must be copied to humans with sufficient scope to occur the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the greater the number of people who are infected with it, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If applied properly, its transfer to humans would be difficult to prevent by quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four CoVs obtained in the community have shifted into human populations, starting with the usual sip in patients normally responding to the disease.
These viruses do not require a store of animals.
In contrast, the overly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not fit well in humans and their intrinsic relief cannot be maintained.
They need to maintain and spread their zoonotic reservoirs and find the opportunity to move to easily understandable target people, perhaps through one or more intermediaries and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs obtained in the community.
It's quite toxic as HCoVs have gotten in the community, at the moment.
However, it is more disease-causing or more pathogenic than those obtained by HCoV in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is perfectly suited to humans and moves within humans without a reservoir or intermediary host animal.
Before discussing the origins of HCoV, it will help us to discuss the meanings and characteristics of evolution, natural reservoirs, mediators and amplifiers hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it has a closely related ancestor who shares high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well suited and non-pathogenic to this host.
Also, a reservoir host holds HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and the natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediary host before or on its introduction to humans, it is not fit to fit the new host and is often pathogenic.
The intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and plays the role of an infecting host by allowing the virus to be copied transferably and then transferring it to humans to increase the scope of human infection.
An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot maintain its easing within the intermediary host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adhere to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediary host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In retrospect, epidemiological data showed that the SARS case index has a history of contact with mammals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgGs compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets and racoon dogs in live animal markets were the first to be identified with SARS-CoV-like viruses that were almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no additional SARS has been reported after killing all the muses on the market.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from forest or farmland with no exposure to animal life on the market are clearly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets can only serve as an intermediate that enhances host but not natural reservoir.
Remarkably, since 80% of the various animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that many types of small mammals can also serve as an intermediate that enhances the host of SARS-CoV are inseparable.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent quest for the natural host animal of SARS-CoV opened up a close relationship with the butterfly's CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoes.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other butterfly CoVs are similar to 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology in SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the host of evolving human pathogens.
Many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also referred to as from bats, but none other than a named WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from the bat's debris sample has been shown to use bat, mouse and human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry.
It is intriguing that sera of convalescent SARS patients have the ability to neutralize WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although the similarity between these two viruses is high, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent SARS-CoV virus and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic evaluation combines MERS-CoV in the same group as bat's CoV-HKU4 and bat's CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 of the bat and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetic closer to the beta-CoVs of bats identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest related CoV-HKU25 of butterflies share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the closest reservoir host to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels that originate from the Middle East in many African countries.
The MERS-CoV virus-like life found in humans is separated from the nose swabs of dromedary camels, which further indicates that camels act as the definitive reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that general mild symptoms but large spread of the virus have been observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels have released viruses not only through the respiratory route but also through the dung-rich route, which is also the main route for virus releases from bats.
However, questions remain because many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which may be left between humans or unknown migration routes associated with unknown animal species with MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV RaTG13 of bat separated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence of differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too high to assign parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the current(s) reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2 unless they find in the future an almost identical CoV of bats.
Possibly, SARS-CoV-2 host animals should be among the wild animal species purchased and killed in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where many of the first cases of COVID-19 are related, suggesting a potential animal-smuggling event.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as peanuts (Manis javanica) may also harbor beta ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The novel CoV genomes share an 85-92% homology sequence in SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with almost 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They combined two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shared a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identification.
In clear variation, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more distinct, even if the level of homology sequence in the genomes is higher.
An earlier study in pancreatic patients also reported the discovery of viral contigencies from lung samples, which are similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study confirmed various methods of mating and manual curation to form a partial sequence of the genome consisting of an estimated 86.3% of the total length of the viral genome.
We can't rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct source of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence of separation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
The pathway of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains stable.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shared the highest sequence homology across the genome.
It is highly suspected that the high level of similarity between the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 pangolin is caused by the evolution of selectivity-mediated convergents.
One contrary proposal favors a recombination between a SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild species.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is prevalent in beta-CoVs.
The jury is not yet of the current zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses have been found in rodent.
A butterfly CoV called ARCoV.2 (the Appalachian Ridge CoV) referred to the North American tricolored butterfly has been reported to show a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another butterfly CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was observed in Ghana, while camels are also suspected as its intermediate host.
For tranquility, the current knowledge of the animal origins of the known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.1 and Table 2.
The Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the events of transition between species of HCoV in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species that infected humans from pets in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E interspecies is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the direct transfer of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans but not alpacas may have had contact with bats in a shared ecological area.
Instead, people have close contact with the alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E associated with alpha-CoV of bats is different and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility of alpacas getting HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be denied.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can pass HCoV-229E on humans directly.
Alternatively, even though alpha-CoVs will serve as a HCoV-229E gene pool, alpacas and dromedary camels can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a good example of the transition between species from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
Evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is referred to in its initial recognition and is also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich source of the virus species for the exchange between species of genetic fragment and transfer between species.
The longevity of life, numerous colonies, close social contact and strong flying ability are all desirable favorable conditions for bats to become a perfect 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It fits well with these camels that move from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a highly contagious disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its appealing relief to people is an accident and people remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV because its relief cannot be maintained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of camels, if any, differs from that of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, beta-CoVs are completely pathogenic to beta-CoVs.
They can be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be considered or not taken into account in future studies.
First, bats can be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can divide the ecologically appropriate area into bats by killing or mining charcoal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancer hosts where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans get the virus by dying and eating toy meat.
It is possible that many mammals including pets are easily mastered by SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of mammals and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species associated with both bats and bats.
The search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of host animals, the three main factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs that cross species boundaries.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the mutation numbers of CoVs can be considered ""average"" to ""high"" with an average substitution number of <0x7E>10-4 substitution per year at each site 2, depending on the phase of the CoV adaptation."
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion results in excessively high mutation and weak or even senseless.
Notably, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most anticipated anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, CoV mutation rates are almost a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs are not well suited to the host.
When compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation in humans.
It may be suitable for other hosts that are close to people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also applicable to MERS-CoV, which is well suited for dromedary camels.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to quickly disable vaccines and anti-viruses against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the possibility for joint evolution between different species, which is beneficial for the appearance of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported repeatedly by a unique open reading frame and protein roles encoded towards the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
"Third, CoVs have randomly and frequently moved templates during RNA replication through a unique ""copy-choice"" mechanism".
In a host that serves as a storage container, strand replacement occurs often during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Largely homogeneous whole and subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to form new CoVs.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interactions related to defecation
In addition to the three factors of the virus mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the transfer between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is regarded as a common example, which also shows evidence of positive selection as it transitions between species.
Based on a comparative analysis between those separated from humans and SARS-CoV of the mouse, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation to a variety of hosts, especially in the RBD mutations of the S protein.
Often, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is strongly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as the coreceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, mice, mice and raccoon dogs, which allow for the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be distinct from human and civet viral excretions in RBD and 4 of these were seen in receptor-binding motifs for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may enhance the interaction of spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In a nutshell, both amino acid substitutions can be important for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that the cellular receptors of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are similar.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that the binding of its S protein to human ACE2 may be interchangeable.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher binding linkage than between human ACE2 and SARSCoV S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine if any other coreceptors are required for the elimination of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but has other parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also report for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after detachment between species from their host animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the resulting transfer of HCoVs between animal species is also controlled by other host interactions and constraint factors.
The diversity of these protein hosts between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and animal pests can be an obstacle to the transition between species.
HCoVs need to absorb host dependency factors and the subvert host restriction experiences successful inter-type easing.
In this context, the molecular determinants in this important site of viral-host interaction will remain to be explored and described.
An unbiased screening of host involvement in all genomes and constraint factors for SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR's state-of-the-art technology can be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: returning to ground zero
The diversity of butterfly CoVs provides many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also promote the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the removal or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to significantly alter viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been identified as essential for human adaptation, since bat viruses associated with SARS-CoV are separated but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide removal feature of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the onset of the human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host exchange.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination at the origins of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions are identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Also, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced events of recombination between different genera, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from easing viruses from selection constraints, such as the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to a two-nucleotide removal.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also caused by the urgency of choosing their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms or mild symptoms were observed only when CoV bats were infected, suggesting the same fit between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are well suited to CoVs in relation to anatomy and physiology.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response to bats are well reduced in the causality of the disease initiated by CoV.
In addition, natural killing of cell activity in bats is inhibited due to upregulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression levels of the major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed from the high metabolic activity of bats can both control the replication of CoV and affect the proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus giving a virus that is known to be more selective for generations.
Further pathogenic CoV strains can also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that the three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They react quickly without obtaining a strong host immune response.
Here are the secrets of why there are visible asymptomatic carriers and what is causing the severe case of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in carriers with no symptoms, the immune response is inhibited by doubling CoV replication.
The same strategy of eliminating the resistance response can have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the management of type I interferon in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
With this recommendation, preventing NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 can be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme from which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While a beta-CoV of butterflies that shares 95% of the nucleotide homology in SARS-CoV is identified, there is also a CoV of butterflies that shares 96% of the nucleotide homology in SARS-CoV-2.
Since civets and other animals on the market have been found to have viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the current intermediary hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs that are remarkably similar or homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that the pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts or the beta-CoV pangolins may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is human-made either inadvertently or inadvertently.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has rapidly changed our understanding of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs for human detoxification.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and transferred to humans via intermediate hosts.
Because SARS-CoV infection originates from the interaction between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and killing of civets there can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same justification, peanuts should be removed from the markets to avoid zoonotic contagion, due to the discovery of many beta-CoV peanut lines closely associated with SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans by penguins and other mammals remains to be investigated in the future.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and oil products for local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice then all the camels to control MERS, as did the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurring spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, along with other measures to control infection.
Since we can't get rid of these viruses, new genotypes may appear that will cause spreads.
There are various zoonotic CoVs that are transferring the war.
In particular, butterfly CoVs with zoonotic potential are different.
There are many instances that these zoonotic CoVs change and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or deadly to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should have been abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19 complications, a better preparation and response plan should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural containers until they have the opportunity to fertilize.
Even though bats have many features that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunity to connect humans to bats and other wild animal species can be humiliated if humans are taught to remove them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human evictions and future prevalences.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from ecological areas of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the zoonotic brain that originated from SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats cause a predatory SARS-CoV-2 virus to bite, it is interesting to see what events the bats and the predators can share in the same ecologically appropriate area.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human detachment, people's detachment from bats should be determined.
Third, if the third mammal will be a true intermediate host, it is necessary to figure out how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Lastly, since many mammals include pets that can easily be captained by SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether it is a bat, ant or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parents viruses that are nearly identical will be identified with future natural hosts.
Continuous investigations in this section will explain the evolution pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
"Update of the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 ""suspicious case"" and ""confirmed case"" is required""
On the 6th of February 2020, our team published a quick guide to the advice for the analysis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and made an excellent world reference for anti-pandemic combat.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on findings in ongoing research and experience in clinical work; therefore, the strategies of analysis and treatment have continued as well.
"In this letter, we have responded to a column in our guideline and given the latest diagnostic standard of ""suspicious case"" and ""confirmed case"" according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the Republic of China."
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a spread, now officially named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 was introduced by the WHO as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide to counseling and was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
This has attracted a lot of attention since the publication.
But keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing discoveries in research and experience in clinical training; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), on 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, released a total of seven editions with some contexts that are heavily readable.
Now our guide has received a review of Zhou et al., they have introduced a proposal for simple marking based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence for our guideline and has also made important references for the petitioner around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude to them.
However, their work also requires an update in accordance with the latest Analysis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Testing in the seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case it is necessary to combine any subject of epidemiological history features and two subjects of clinical indications in order to produce a comprehensive epidemiological analysis, or it is necessary to meet the three subject of epidemiological analysis:
Epidemiological history: epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; epidemiological history; or epidemiological history.
Clinical manifestations: Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells showing normal, decreased, or decreased number of lymphocytes in the first stage of onset.
Diagnosing the confirmed case should be based on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel <0xCE><0xB1>abody ribosomes; (3) positive for the positive IgM antibody or the IgV-seCoG antibody.
We can see that a real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of the pathogen in the blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers looking for a best-in-class kit of nucleic acid detection for rapid analysis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood sampling, which has resulted in increased presence of a variety of antibody samples, and supports.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us to take care of patients who are unusually symptomatic and asymptomatic.
"Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, because they classify the person without clinical symptoms as ""low risk""".
The points system also needs to be proven in additional clinical activity and study.
In conclusion, we expect more direct evidence to come and call on readers to give their inputs.
"For the analysis of ""suspicious case"" and ""confirmed case"", we propose to follow and follow the latest rules of their host countries."
Our team has also been able to update the guidelines to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the most in a day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed that there were five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day due to the microbiome.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has spread the number of births infected cases that included 114 active cases and 33 recoveries where remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, mentioned that among the dead were four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are aged 60 and older, two are between 51 and 60, and one is 41-50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that the public vehicle would be stopped working longer than previously planned, until it comes Saturday.
The closure of public transport was first started on March 26 and is planned to be completed on Saturday, April 4.
Travelling of important goods -- medical, burn and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people returning home from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the coronavirus-infected disease.
The significant event came the same day that Malawi confirmed his first coronavirus infections and Zambia earned his first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea, on Thursday, claimed that it was one of the few countries to remain free of coronavirus facilities.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus have been recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, said there were more than 1,000 US deaths on Wednesday caused by coronavirus outbreaks.
All over the world, countries have been advocating more stringent methods to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Throughout the country, President Vladimir Putin has declared that Russian citizens will continue to be paid even if they do not enter employment until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency by 15 days; the passed vote had 215 votes in favor, ten in absentia, and one against.
Saudi Arabia extends curfews to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that last throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only valid between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia's retailers have reduced the restrictions on toilet paper for each transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their restrictions on buying toilet paper in two and one package per transaction at all stores across the country, each one.
ALDI also started a one-packet limitation, on Monday.
These limits are packaged as messages on checkouts, and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Consumers have been reported to be stockpiling out of fear of COVID-19 in case people have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery in one package per order.
These changes followed the last four-packet each transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, released by the media on March 8, reported that at the set of four restrictive packages, ""many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery"", and called the demand ""never happened"", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, was quoted as saying.
"Sale rose by ""high rise"" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson."
Costco's Canberra store was also limited to the allowed quantity in two packages last week.
To bridge the gap, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and brought delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI stocked for the planned Wednesday special which was available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Watch Association, said that the goods were trying to raise the spectators, but it was difficult to make the local council's restrictions on the timing of truck deliveries.
He expects higher production costs, as suppliers are trying to meet the need, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early resignation of the goods, there were other stores that would not be able to run the next Wednesday special.
In a report to News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, an expert on assessments from the Queensland University of Technology, said that shelves dominate the shops every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a large item, leading to a low amount of stock, and, when all is sold, leaves ample space on the shelves, which adds to the feeling of shortage.
"""Sina Coles and Woolworths have a perspective [on] if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if a product like toilet rolls and sanitizers can be [sold] and a lot, maybe you can reduce caution""" said Russell Zimmerman to ABC News."
The creator of the recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said they had run out of stock last Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper that manufactures Sorbent, emphasized that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to a report by News.com.au.
Domain.com, a site real estate, has reported several sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because consumers had time to not work during the long weekend of Labor Day or Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-based newspaper, put together a press release with eight pages of press and toilet paper.
The stores were originally hesitant to enforce the restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashing and flour.
Also, outside Australia, an online British supermarket Ocado was observed on Sunday night limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper in two 12 rolls package.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — that is a pandemic.
"While the word ""pandemic"" only refers to the extent to which a disease is spread, it does not refer to how dangerous certain cases are, the WHO urged the need for governments to act:"
"All countries have been able to change the course of this pandemic.
When viewed, examined, treated, separated, abducted and mobilized by countries, their people are seen," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
"""We are deeply concerned both with the obstructive levels of spread and seriousness and with the obstructive level of inaction."""
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the pandemic is ""never like it."""
"He said, in statements published by CNN in February, ""except for the flu, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from the onset to the continuous spread of the world."""
"Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying ""we have never seen a pandemic released by a coronavirus."""
He continued, "and we have not yet seen a pandemic that can be controlled by humans."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak of emergency health in a public memory internationally.
"The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "Bottom line, it's going to get worse." "
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe chronic respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which was declared a Public Health Emergency as a World Remembrance (International Concern) on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in an estimated 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The death toll is estimated at 4% in China, while it covers the world from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and nausea.
Complications may include pneumonia and chronic respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
Typically within five days the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms, but it can last from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Symptomatic and supportive therapy is the main treatment.The recommended steps include avoiding hand washing, covering your own mouth when you're coughing, keeping distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they're infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfew, workplace risk control, and closure of the facility.
The pandemic has led to widespread disruption of social life around the world, the exclusion or cancellation of games, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of equipment recalled by panic buying.
Schools and institutions are closed to any national or local base in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the microbe has been leaked online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other people of Eastern and Southeast Asian descent, and others from areas with significant cases of the microbe.
Due to the reduced travel and closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases that were unknown as of 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Cases usually have links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and thus the virus is presumed to have zoonotic origin or origin in the animal and is transmitted to humans.
The virus that causes the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, purulent coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The previous known person with symptoms was eventually discovered to have contracted the disease on December 1, 2019, and that person was not.
In the early numbers of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case monitored on November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from the province of Hubei, may be the first.On February 26, 2020, the WHO first reported that, as the new cases reported in Italy.
There may be significant insufficient reporting of cases, especially in those with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, there were few cases reported in young people, out of about 19 cases below which accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom's chief science adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population needed to be vaccinated before achieving effective herd immunity.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and their analysis has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has yet examined more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies that do not examine those with mild symptoms alone, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 in China, until January 23, found an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections, and that these undocumented infections were the source of the infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was greater than the reported cases.
Initial diagnosis of basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the time from manifestation of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, which usually lasts 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, up to February 5 almost 80% of deaths were in excess of 60, and 75% had previous health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official list of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to the dead people considered positive to COVID protocols.
The number of actual deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, as the deaths may not be counted unexamined. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy have shown that the number of overdose deaths during the pandemic exceeds the official COVID death rate factor of 4-5x.
"A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the stated death toll] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the U.S."
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths each were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures were commonly used to count deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time from the prevalence of the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population's incidence such as age, gender, and overall health.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global case death rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates for the ratio of fatalities to the number of cases decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms from after 1 February 2020). Other measures of chronic illness include the number of fatalities or fatality rates (for those with symptoms from 1 February 2020).
These statistics are indefinitely time-bound and track the specific population from dementia to the resolution of the case.
The number of academics attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above assessment in this range is consistent with the results from the first event analysis or randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and the statistical study that assesses the effect of testing on CFR assessments.
The WHO believes that the pandemic can be controlled.
The root and longest start is uncertain and can vary from location to location.
Maciej Boni of the Penn State Exercise said, "If unexamined, it is typical to reach the peaks of pleasant bursts and begin to fall down after no longer available hosts of the disease.
But it's almost impossible now to predict when that will happen".
"China government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has clarified that ""it may be over in June"" if all countries that follow WHO advice take action to prevent microbial outbreaks".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 ""is going to be circulating, potentially for a year or two"""."
"According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures are required ""until vaccination (may be 18 months or more)""."
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus -- because it's so easy to transfer -- will completely disappear""" and it's ""could be a periodic illness, coming back every year"""."
The rush of returning to the salvation of the flock and the extent of the change depended.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively uncertain and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Uncommon symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (plema), loss of sense of smell, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, nausea swelling, swelling of blood, diarrhea, or skin irritation. WHO said
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergent symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, sneezing headaches, sneezing headaches, sneezing headaches, and sneezing headaches.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but in the results of the test confirming the infection, so the researchers came out with the advice that those who have close contact with the confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the infection.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranging from some to 44%.
The usual time of incubation (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the small proportion of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell is 15% initially and 30% respectively.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being discussed at this time.
The disease is believed to primarily spread to close contact and by small droplets from coughing, splitting, or speaking; with close contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that uncovered bowel movements can produce tiny droplets that travel up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some have thought that the virus can also be cured by small droplets that remain in the air for a long time, which can be formed by speaking. Small droplets in the air can also be formed at the time of breathing, including speaking, even if the virus does not actually have air.
Small droplets can sit in the grooves or noses of people who are close to or can suffocate into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory juices to pass into the air and thus result in air dispersion.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns that it can spread through human debris, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government rejected the possibility of tae-big transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The microbe is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, even if the spread may occur before the symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
People who are considered positive for the disease for up to three days before symptoms appear suggest that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
There have been few reports of cases that do not show symptoms confirmed by the laboratory, but the symptom-free transfer has been identified by some countries while investigating contact vaccination.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person in general can infect two to three others. The virus lives for several hours or days in infected objects.
The microbe was found to be present for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard, and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, is variable based on humidity and temperature. Favourite animals and other animals are considered to be positive in COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the microbe on to humans, although British authorities advise to wash hands after sitting on animals, such as finishing contact with other surfaces that infected people may be able to hold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel microbial, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of severe respiratory diseases cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the nature of coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by soap used at home, which melts in its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronaviruses are genetically contagious to the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two native-to-panic strains.
It is 96% identical to the level of the entire genome in other samples of bat coravavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acid in some parts of the genome sequences between viruses from worms and from humans.
Whole-genome comparisons have so far found nearly 92% of the genetic material is similar to the coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Microbial infection can first be measured based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimatum that by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although not so certain, with many features of its imaging that are consistent with other lung and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line COVID-19 test"".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The analysis uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this analysis is performed by shrinking the inside of the nose or nasopharyngeal swab even though shrinking the inside of the throat or throat swab can also be used. Some laboratories and companies form serological tests, which can be seen in the antibody.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of imaging in radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people with signs include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society has compiled an international online database of interviewees with confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, there is limited certainty in the identification of COVID-19 imaging without PCR confirmation.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR and showed that even though the measurement is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting considering it as a clotting device in areas of the epidemic.
Artificial-intelligent convolutional neural networks were designed to display microbial description features with both radiographs and CT.
Methods to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, preventing the eyes, nose or mouth from being washed with unwashen hands, and sneezing or splitting the bladder and placing the tissue in the pelvis.
It is recommended for those who may already have an infection to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing has also been recommended to prevent suffocation. Many governments have tightened or warned against unnecessary travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the microbe has reached the stage of spreading to the community in large parts of the world.
This means that the microbes are spreading within communities, and do not know where or how they are infected by some of the members of the community.Health care providers who care for a person who may be cured are strongly advised to use standard precautions and precautions to protect one's well-being.
The use of location data from government mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, including Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that issued a statement calling for limitations on this type of disclosure.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and until April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on friendly-to-private solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other phones.
Users will receive a message if they have been in close contact with a person who is considered to be positive for COVID-19.The false-cure moves about how to prevent infection; for example, the rinsing of the nose and mouthwash is not effective.
COVID-19 has not been vaccinated, even though many organizations have worked hard to form one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands are seen dizzy; before eating; and after having their own nose, sneezing, or splitting.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by soap used at home, which triggers its protective bubble.
The CDC even recommended the use of a hand sanitizer based on alcohol with at least 60% alcohol by volume when not getting soap and water immediately.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth of those who have not washed their hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned with many solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for the stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected case of COVID or confirmed in a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, general areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs should be shared electronically.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or tissue when coughing up or falling down, and immediately discard any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as the use of the mask can limit the amount and distance of small drops moving as they speak, fall, and fall.
The WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""Wearing a mask can reduce the behavior of [people] to handle their faces, which is the main source of infection if there is no adequate hand hygiene."" The masks are also recommended to be used by people.
The WHO recommends that masks should only be worn by healthy people if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people avoid holding their face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommended wearing a non-medical face mask made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy public members, especially in close association with people (1 meter or 3 feet or closer).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when riding on public transport or staying in public places.
Thailand's health officials encourage people to make facemask fabrics at home and wear them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public access without wearing a mask or covering a person's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear face masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone who enters a grocery store should wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when they are outside.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks every day since mid-March, ordered trains and buses inside the city to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has made it possible to replace the wearing of masks whenever it goes outside, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks for those who can't afford masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is associated with infection control action with the aim of slowing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact of individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding populated areas, using contactless contacts, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in the regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meeting recommended by the U.S. to government representatives and health organizations decreased rapidly from 250 people (if no known spread of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
On the 22nd of March 2020, the German government banned public gatherings that exceeded two people. Elders and people with diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illness, abnormal hypertension, and poor immune system that faced a greater risk of chronic diseases.
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has led to the implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative means. some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health."
It includes recommendations to have sex only with the person you are with at home, with no viruses or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have ordered or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions were issued for high-risk groups.
It is recommended that those who may be exposed to a person with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with extensive self-quarantine transmission within 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are the suppression or suppression, and remediation.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and separate the infected as well as to initiate other means of infection control and vaccines to stop the outbreak of the disease in the rest of the population.
If the spread of the disease can no longer be prevented, efforts will be shifted to the mitigation phase: steps will be taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of both the harmful and relieving control measures can be performed at the same time.
The imposition of more stringent measures to combat the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of the outbreak of a contagious disease is the attempt to reduce the outbreak of the epidemic, known as the establishment of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of exaggerating health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-physical interventions that can be applied to intersections include personal measures of prevention, such as hand sanitation, wearing face-to-face, and self-quarantine; community-based measures that can be applied to intersections of physics (physical distancing) and intersections.
Other countries have also approved a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of microbes.
South Korea has introduced multiple screenings and localized quarantines, and issued alerts to the actions of infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial assistance to people who have been infected and placed themselves under quarantine and imposed a large fine on people who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased face mask production and penalized illegal concealment of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States have shown that deceleration (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and sealing (reversing the epidemic growth) have been major
Policies for optimal recovery can reduce the need for health care by 2/3 and after death by half, but will still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and exhaustion of health systems.
Suppression or suppression may be chosen but it must be maintained until the virus has spread to the human population (or until a vaccine has been developed, if it is first), because the infection on the other side will quickly return when the steps are restarted.
The long-term intervention to curb the pandemic is causing costs to society and the economy.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but developmental efforts are already underway, including the analysis of existing drugs.
Drinking the drug on the stool purchased without a prescription, drinking fluids, and resting can help resolve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can improve the results.
Many compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
"The WHO also said that some ""traditional and home remedies"" may provide relief to the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19."
Increasing capacity and adaptation to health care for the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the WHO as a key response step to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the substitution of resources in a wide range of hospitals, including the focus on laboratory interventions and interventions, on COVID-19 interventions, on interventions
There are various theories about where the earliest case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of novel coronavirus can be returned on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of it is linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells animals' lives, and a squirrel is that the microbe comes from one of these animal species; or, in other words, it comes from the animal, in other words, it comes from the animal.

Many localities have also witnessed panic buying that has led to a shortage of meat from important grocery stores such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, making up for supply shortages.
The technology industry has been warned of delays in the shipment of electronic goods in particular.
According to director-general Tedros Adhanom, the need for personal protective equipment has increased by 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also accelerated the delay in the supply of medical items by four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, so the WHO warns that it will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity caused the lack of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high number of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the same areas were helped from scratch.
China and Italy's practices against illegal smuggling and illegal trade in critical products have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a significant reduction in agricultural production, but prices may have risen according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves occurred only briefly, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials issued reserves of pork to ensure adequate food for the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to be reserved for emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was very difficult to reach in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of the microbial, and sales of pigment fell by 20.5%.
Because mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak is seen as a major impeding threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit stated that the market will remain volatile until a clearer picture of potential outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic downturn due to the impact of the epidemic on world growth could have exceeded the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from a Washington Exercise expert in St. Louis gave $300<0x2B> billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly ""scrambled"" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China."
Stock markets around the world fell on February 24 due to the number of COVID-19 cases rising outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to speculation about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed their deepest slump from a 2008 slump in 2008, with the Dow's slump of 1,19 points.
The week ended with more than 10% of all three indexes.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's highest credit rating, but retained Negative Outlook.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central banks and the state.
Central banks are responding more quickly than when the financial meltdown occurred in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places including travel attractions, and the warning of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, as British regional airline Flybe crashed.
At a level never before seen the impact on the line of the shipping industry.
Several train stations and ship ports were also closed.
Along with the epidemic is Chunyun, a major travel period associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
The number of events involving large crowds has been cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year's celebrations, and with private companies that have also closed their own shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid major gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple feasts.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the official New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations. Generally the retail sector is affected, with reductions in waiting times or delays.
Visits to viewers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Viewers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This also resulted in a 33–43% drop in consumers at market centers in March compared to February.
Additional measures are being taken by mall operators around the world, such as increased cleanliness, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of consumers, and cancellation of events.

Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant workers have been stranded at home in the inner provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
The outbreak of the coronavirus in Canada may have cost up to 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has caused up to 4 million jobs in India (with tens of millions of migrants).
In the second half of March, 4 million workers in France applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million workers in Britain applied for the global credit scheme. Almost half a million well-known Kurdish companies in Germany have sent bribes to their employers.
France and Brittany carried out the compensation scheme for temporary work.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors are heavily affected by the pandemic, which has a strong impact on the operations of organizations as well as individuals —both employed and free— around the world.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector seek to promote their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to the community's cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support actors whenever possible.
As of March 2020, in the world and across a range of scopes, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions have uninterruptedly closed their performances, events and performances that have been cancelled or postponed.
In response there is a strong effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms.Another recent and rapid elimination of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as concerts and music festivals.
The film industry has also experienced disruption.The Vatican has announced that the celebrations of the Holy Day in Rome, which will take place in the final week of the Christian awakening period in Kuwaresma, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommend older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Mass every Sunday; some of the churches intersect by radio, online live streaming or television while others offer worship inside their parked vehicle.
With the closing of the Roman Catholic Goddess in Rome to its churches and chapels and the absence of Christians in St. Peter's Square, other religious associations also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.

"Closed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee (International Olympic Committee) announced on March 24 that the "plans" and "plans" of the casino will be on a date that exceeds 2020 but will not exceed the 20-day mark.
This has led to many gamblers moving online, along with many online casinos reporting significant increases in the amount of their new signings up. The entertainment industry is also affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concert tours.
All the performances of many major theaters such as those on Broadway were also staged.
"Some artists have explored ways to continue to develop and share work on the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based ""funs"" for performing, distributing, and performing performances."
On the internet, many memes with a theme of the coronavirus have spread as many turn to laughter and confusion amidst uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, more serious harm, xenophobia, and racial hatred have been observed among Chinese and East Asian people, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and anger have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still in China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world by Chinese people who were eligible for microbial or receiving what was said to be fair payment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many citizens of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their region of origin.
There has been support for Chinese, both online and offline, and for those in areas affected by the virus.
Following the launch of the outbreak in the new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, may also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia.The citizens of the countries who are infected with such diseases include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea are not.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese worshipers as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in the number of racist abuses, as well as visits.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and in people who detect antibodies created in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test is specific and only assigned to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the most recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be both used for analysis and population detection.
Antibody tests show how many people have developed the disease, including people whose symptoms are too simple to report or people who do not show symptoms.
The exact level of mortality and the level of immunity of the human group to the population can be determined from the results of this analysis.
Due to limited analysis, as of March 2020 no countries have reliable data on the spread of microbes in their population.
As of March 23, no country has examined more than 3% of their population, and there is a wide variation in how much testing needs to be carried out across countries.
Its variation is likely to have a major impact on the level of reported deaths, which are likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis can be performed on respiratory samples obtained from a variety of methods, including intranasal or nasopharyngeal swab or dura or sputum sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
A RT-PCR scan with a throat swab or throat swab can only be performed in the first week of the disease.
Over time, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to reproduce in the lungs.
For infected people who have been tested in the second week, the alternative sample material can be carried out from the deep air passage through a suction catheter or can use dehumidification equipment (dura).
One of the first PCR analyses was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed the test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a clinical grade, detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) for SaRS-CoV-2 based on PCR on January 28, 2020.

One of the three genetic analyses in older versions of the test kits resulted in undesirable results due to misrepresentations, and an exhaustive analysis at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in fewer than 100 samples per day being successfully processed.
It is not specified that tests using the two components will be expected until February 28, 2020, and it is not until it is allowed to begin testing by state and local laboratories.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began the test in the early days of March 2020.
Starting March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the worldwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics has conducted a similar nationwide CoVID-19 test since March 9, 2020.
There is no advertised quantity limit; the collection of specimens and processing must be carried out in accordance with the CDC laws.
In Russia, the COVID-19 analysis was developed and conducted by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020 the review was registered by the Federal Service for Health Surveillance. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed a test to detect the infection with COVID-19. On March 24, 2020, the FDAs were approved for Diagnostics received.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing Abbott's m2000 system; recently the FDA issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for an examination that lasted 45 minutes.
The FDA approved the test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles this method can deliver positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are nearly 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects an increase in manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day. An analysis using a monoclonal antibody that specifically adds up to 15 minutes of nucleocapsid protein (N protein) to the novel coronavirus
"A review of the literature in March 2020 confirmed that "heart x-rays have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the CT [computed tomography] result can be shown even before the symptoms begin.""
Common features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass that is pale in color and has a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
The dominance of the subpleural, over-preparation and coexistence is stimulated as the disease develops.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan in the area of origin of the current pandemic suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although not very specific, where many of its imaging features overlap with other lung and prose diseases.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used to test or as a first-line test to identify COVID-19"". as of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for preliminary testing".
Part of the response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect the infection of individuals starting at 7 days or approximately after symptoms have occurred, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. Assays can be performed in laboratory centers (CT) or in point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high results in many clinical laboratories can perform these tests but their availability depends on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a single specimen for whole blood or peripheral blood is usually used, even if serial specimens can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT a single blood sample is usually taken by penetration into the skin.
Unlike PCR procedures, the screening step is not required prior to the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named the 29 entities that gave notice to the agency as required and now therefore have the ability to share their tests with their antibodies.
As of April 7, 2020, only single tests have been approved by the FDA under the authorization of emergency use. In the last days of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics have received permission for their antibody viruses antibody test kits, which can be tested on IGgTec.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and is thus faster than conventional PCR viral RNA assays.
Usually seen in 14 days of antibodies after the onset of infection. In the early part of April, the UK learned that there was not enough good use in the antibody test kits it purchased.
"Hong Kong has set up an emergency plan where the suspects can stay at home," the emigence department will give a sample tube to the patient," they snarl here, it will come back and take the result after a few moments. The British NHS has informed the patient that the emergency plan will lead the patient.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most comprehensive examinations of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians spoke on March 2, which it had a capacity of about 12,000 examinations a day at first.
The cost will be charged to health insurance when the examination is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, tests while inside the vehicle have been offered in major cities.

In the construction followed by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasted 5 days, the modeling showed cases in Hubei would be 47 higher and the equivalent amount of quarantine exercise would be double if the capacity of this analysis did not reach the rank.
Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai are expected to follow Wuhan Laboratory, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020 the daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays have been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
In March, deficiencies and insufficient amounts of the substance became a barrier to mass testing in the US and the UK and the US.
This led some authors to investigate the sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) in 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further analysis. It was announced on March 31 that the United Arab Emirates had already been able to population-based and population-based sampling now, testing for more populations.
"It is through a combination of drive-through capability, and the purchase of population-scale mass-throughput laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency pan-detection laboratories in China)."
The lab is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day developed over 14 days and is the world's leading provider of this scale to operate outside of China.
In China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States, different diagnostic recipes have been developed that target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German recipe for the manufacture of kits sent to small countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which memorized the analyses available in the U.S.China and the United States experts have noted that there have been repercussions on the reliability of test kits and these repercussions on the early onset of the disease.
On the contrary, experts have said that the widespread availability of screening in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity that is mostly in the private sector laboratories has been built for almost several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization was called to initiate screening programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for screening due to the widespread spread of the virus that has led to the outbreaks of thousands of screenings in private laboratories and suppl.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
"In the United States, there are ""batches"" the test kits developed by the CDC; so the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that stopped private testing. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd." but the results were not established.
The company explained that the wrong results may be the result of the wrong collection of samples or the wrong use of kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove kits that returned the wrong results, and replace it with other test kits given by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong result. Slovakia has bought 1.2 million test kits from China.
"Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> proposed that it should be discarded to the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a ""high level of propulsion""" and did not "use those" in 2020."
The analysis, followed by the quarantine of positive subjects and the follow-up of people who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects, resulted in positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the town of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first to die of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted a two-time analysis of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with a ten-day interval.
About half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
When traveling in a confined area, it completely reduces new infections.
Through aggressive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, inspections, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has continued slowly than in other developed countries, but there are no severe restrictions such as forced closures and restrictions.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holiday on March 23.
Some of the other countries have managed the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, travel restrictions into the country, scrutiny, and quarantine, but with lower aggressive lockdowns, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with many studies, associated with the number of deaths, had a lower rate of deaths, perhaps because these countries were more capable of detecting those with no or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without screening capabilities and the national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmed screening.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the range "Positive as % of reviews" is influenced by the country's analysis policy.
The country that only examines people who are admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive at %s of the tests than the country that examines all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other things that are fair.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene rules, is an act of cleaning one's own hands for the desire to remove soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unloving substances.
"Continuous hand washing with soap in certain ""dangerous situations""" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as vomiting and cholera, which are passed through the route from the dirt to the mouth."
People with respiratory diseases such as flu or common colds can also be treated, for example, if they do not wash their hands before rinsing their eyes, nose, or mouth (such as mucous membranes).
The five critical moments in the days that are important to wash hands include: before and after drying, after cleaning the baby's pussy or replacing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before and before eating and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
When there is no water and soap, hands can be cleaned in ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After replacing the diaper or cleaning the child dressed.
When you wake up, wake up or cry.
After handling the animal, animal food, or animal dirt.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the practices of health care that are associated with medical procedures and the use of medical methods.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical care can stop or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, microbes, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who manage food or work in the field of medicine, but also important skills for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus, and other contagious diseases; preventing contagious causes of vomiting; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduces the number of babies who die in domestic births.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing can lead to a slight improvement in the breastfeeding of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, the rates of death of young people associated with respiratory and vomiting disorders can be reduced by the onset of simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the number of deaths from these diseases by almost 50%.
The means by which handwashing progresses can reduce one-third of the incidences of vomiting, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-wage areas.
48% reduction in episodes of vomiting can be associated with handwashing. Handwashing is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent vomiting and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior is done in homes, schools, and the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death in children under five years of age, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Swelling and pneumonia are at the same time the cause of nearly 3.5 million deaths of children each year.
According to UNICEF, when it manages to soak hands before eating and after dressing it can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from constipation by about half and deaths from respiratory infections by a quarter or one quarter.
Hand washing is often accompanied by other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and sanitation or water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing hands also protects against impetus that is transferred by direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of handwashing is that regular handwashing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, peeling skin conditions also known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is more common in health care workers.
Excessive hand washing has also been seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five cleaning times in the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of fecal-oral disease; after using the bath (feeding, smearing), after cleaning the baby's pussy (replacement of the diaper), before feeding or before feeding the child, before feeding/feeding and before eating.
At other times when the proper method of hand washing should be trained for the prevention of the transmission of the disease to cover the before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after the splitting, sneezing, or sneezing of your nose; after the sneezing of the animal's dirt or sneezing;
In many countries, there is a low number of hand washing with soap.
In a recent study, the researchers found that in 2015 there was an increase in the number of people in the U.S. who used to wash their hands with soap, 38.7% of the households used to wash their hands with soap, a 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest number of people in the U.S. and the United States had the highest number of people in the world.
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of timely action to promote children's health and education."
Cleansing twice a year, filled with hand washing daily with soap, brushing teeth with fluoride, is in the middle of its national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is increased by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents will reduce the barriers to the solution, and increase the soluble capacity.
It is not effective to clean the skin just because fats and proteins do not easily mix in the water, where they are parts of organic soil.
However, the cleaning is assisted by a reasonable flow of water..
The solid soap may contain bacteria derived from previous uses, due to its reusable properties.
A small number of studies looking at the translation of the microbe from contaminated whole soap decided that the translation was uncertain because the bacteria had already been resisted by the bubble.
"The CDC still promises that ""liquid soap that doesn't need to be handled for release is more desirable""".
Antibacterial soaps have been greatly promoted in the public's health.
Currently, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended antiseptic or disinfectant is selected for organisms that are not antibiotic-resistant in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, with an extensive list of non-resistant types of organisms.
So, even though antibiotic resistant strains have not been selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are traded.
In addition to surfactants and antioxidants in the skin, acidic acids can include sophisticated formulations (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial active benzoic acids and supplementary compounds of the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, vitamins).
The warm water that is comfortable to wash your hands is not warm enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacterium increases rapidly at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm, boiling water is more effective than cold, boiling water in removing natural oils that will survive soils and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that the use of soft water has no effect on the reduction of microbes in the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is an ingredient in hand cleaning that is not used with water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcoholic hand-washing agents began to gain popularity as non-water-based hand-washing agents (also known as alcohol-based hand-washing agents, antiseptic hand-washing agents, or hand-washing agents).
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol that is pronounced in combination with a diluent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) that can make a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to make a liquid, or foam for easy use and for reducing the effect of alcohol targeting.
The addition of hydrogen-peroxide added adds more antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol are effective antimicrobial killers.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some of the viruses (such as HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hands about 30 seconds after insertion and 99.99% to 99.999% of bacterial residues (4 to 5 log reduction) microorganisms in the hands are non-alcoholic residues 1 minute after insertion.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost all ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) types of microbes, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. The average amount of hand antiseptic or solvent alcohol must be used to fully read or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are pressed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, bubble, or gel is dry.
The tip of the fingers should also be thoroughly washed, rinsing them in two palms. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing more than hand wash sanitizer, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a substitute for proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless skin softeners and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softeners caused overall less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives contained in alcoholic hand rubs are rare.
The lower tendency to speed up irritant contact dermatitis has become an attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-watery agents do not purify the organic material on the hands, but only affect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many causes of the disease, because the causes of the disease remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizer without alcohol is highly dependent on ingredients and formulations, and historically it is important to be less effective than alcohol and alcohol decoctions.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have recurrent and accumulated antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which showed a decrease in potency after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive adverse reactions.
Many people in low-wage communities can't buy soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil can be more effective than just water, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is whether microorganisms infect the soil or ash can increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant due to water application, it becomes an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The proper method of hand washing is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission that covers the following steps:
Read the hands of hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the irrigated water can be absorbed, while the water temperature does not seem to be able to differentiate.
Wrap the soap in the hands with the correct amount of soap, along with the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap lifts microbes out of the skin, and studies have shown that people behave in the washing of their hands when using soap rather than just water.
Let it cool for at least 20 seconds.
Coagulation creates friction, which helps to remove microbes from the skin, and coagulation for a long time removes more microbes.
It is good to wash under running water.
Inflammation of the plaster can contaminate the hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and sweaty hands are easier to re-infect. The most common survival areas are the size, pulse, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and nail dyes with hard matter can hide microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hand dryness; dry skin can lead to skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infection.

Tippy-tap is a simple technology with a bottle wrapped in a rope, and a foot-tightened handle to pour a little water on your hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand sanitation is an important part of the hand sanitation process, but there is some debate on the most effective form of sanitation in public toilets.
A growing body of research suggests that towel papers are much cleaner than hand-held de-powered toilets seen in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers, and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a dryer to warm the air, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average over the fingers by 194% and in the palms by 254%.
Refrigeration using a jet-air dryer resulted in an increase in the average total number of bacteria over the fingers by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying the hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on finger surfaces by up to 76% and in palms by up to 77%. Scientists also performed screening tests to determine if the user's screening results for potential contamination and other users' screening.
The jet-air dryer, in which the unit emits air at an angular speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of absorbing the microorganism from the hands and the unit and is capable of comforting other people using the bathroom and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed an insignificant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt, a different method of hand washing was appreciated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after drying the hands were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared against polishing on paper towels.
An alternative while traveling without soap and water is to wash the hand using hand-cleaning detergents.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer must have at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory long after a Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered it to be effective (in 1846) in preventing the disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they have been forgotten.
One study found that the number of infections decreased when using them.
Medical handwashing is for at least 15 seconds, using a lot of soap and water or gel to rinse and rinse each part of the hands.
Hands should be peeled on all parts of it.
If there is dirt under the nail, brush teeth can be used to remove it.
Since the microbes can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to lighten well and dry clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to kill the water (and to open any exit door if necessary).
It prevents the hands from getting wet again from its slopes.
The reason for hand washing in the state of health care is the removal of pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and avoid their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the lack of handwashing remained at unacceptable levels in almost all medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses often forgetting to wash their hands before sitting down patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the number of blood vessel infections associated with the catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing common hand washing and sectoral hand rinsing.
The guidance plan for the organization's hand health care rules can also be found on its website for public commentary.
A related review was made by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify the rules on hand sanitation, if the demonstration of enforcement of the regulation is required.
"The World Health Organization has ""Five Minutes"" for hand washing:"
After exposure to blood/physical fluids
before an aseptic activity, and
after the patient's care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soaps) is excreted by the lethal action on a hand-washing agent.
Such a killing action may be desired prior to surgery or in areas where organisms that resist antibiotics are prevalent. To clog a person's hands for surgical surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and sealed with a crankshaft for hand-operated, with chlorhexidine or chlorhexidine.
All jewellery should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and arms to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
A long curing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When irrigating, the water in the arms must be stopped from flowing back into the hands.
After the hand wash is completed, the hands are lined with a clean cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use an antiseptic for the hand before or after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from handwashing came from the first 20% of washing, and the very few additional benefits were obtained more often than 35% of handwashing.
Washing with conventional soap causes more than triple the level of infectious bacterial disease transferred to the food compared to washing the hand with antibacterial soap. The comparison to alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcoholic hand washing with alcohol.

There is a need for more research into which ones are most effective in a variety of healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve the general hand-washing practice.
For example, most of Africa's countryside hand-washing taps close to each private or public space are not enough, even if there are cheap options for making hand-washing stations.
However, a low level of hand washing can also be a result of skillful behavior rather than a result of a lack of soap and water.
Advocating and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy spending, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a long-term change in population behavior.
It is necessary for it to work effectively, manage and balance.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based techniques are effective at increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are not very effective. One example of what they do is to promote handwashing in schools, an example of which is that "EF" is simply "in schools."
When the minimum standard is reached, schools can move from one to a maximum of three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of campaigns promoting hand-washing carried out to reduce ailments and child deaths.
World Handwashing Day is an example of raising awareness of this campaign that is trying to harness behavioral change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has begun adopting a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall effectiveness of the cost of handwashing in developing countries in connection with the DALYs that have been avoided.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health - particularly for people with impaired condition such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first nailed in the middle of the 19th century by the two modernist mentors of hand care Ng<0xC3><0xAD>ng<0xC3><0xA1>ng<0xC3><0xA1>ng<0xC3><0xA1>ng<0xC3><0xA1>ng

At that time most people still believe that infections are caused by a bad odor called miasmas.
In 1980, sudden outbreaks of diseases from food and health care combined with infections gave way to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand health care as an important means of curbing the spread of infection.
The spread of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a heightened awareness of the importance of washing hands with soap in many countries to protect themselves from those infectious diseases.
For example, signs with "appropriate handwashing procedures" are attached next to a washbasin for handwashing on public premises and on premises of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "washing one's own hand" means expressing that one's intention is to assume responsibility for one's own object or share the constraints on it.
It originated from the bible verse in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands in the passion of putting Jesus on the cross, but became an expression with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up the imaginary stain, representing her conscientious conscience regarding the crimes she committed and encouraged her husband to do.
It has also been learned that people, after learning or thinking about what is unethical, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to value washing equipment more.
And then, those people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a preoccupation as mentioned above are not very likely to participate in other "cleaning" equivalent actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend handwashing for both purity and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water but no handwashing soap, is a part of the ritual of handwashing. The ritual of handwashing is a Christian ritual, the ritual of handwashing is a symbol of handwashing, the ritual of handwashing is a symbol of handwashing, the ritual of handwashing is a symbol of handwashing, the ritual of handwashing is a symbol of handwashing.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam ordered the washing of hands after using the bath.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam order washing hands before or after each meal.
Risk Management in the Workplace for Covid-19
Occupational risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health measures for risk controls in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk control depends on the workplace and job responsibilities, based on analysing the risk of convalescence improvements, the severity of community disease, and the risk factors of individual workers who may be weak to cope with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.S., occupations with low exposure to risk have little contact with public employment and other occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupational occupation
People with less dangerous occupations include requiring frequent or close contact with people who are unaware or suspected of COVID-19, but may be infected due to infantile community transmission or world travel.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public such as schools, high-population work environments, and some of the high-volume retail areas.
Risk control for this group, in addition to the main infection suppression techniques, includes ventilation with high-efficiency air damage, anti-coagulant barriers, and the availability of personal protective equipment that can be used in case a person with COVID-19 is infected.
OSHA considers health care and burial workers exposed to known or suspected persons with COVID-19 at risk of high exposure, which increases the risk of very high exposure if the workers are identified from COID specifies whether they are carrying out aerosol or aerosol production procedures.
Hazard controls suitable for these workers include engineering controls such as ventilation in the room with negative pressure, and personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The spread of COVID-19 can have some of the effects within the workplace.
Workers may be out of work due to illness, needing to take care of others, or the fear of possible miscarriage.
The business patterns may change, both when it comes to what is required goods, and how to pick up these goods (such as buying at times achieved or by shipping or by drive-through service or passing the vehicle to buy).
In the end, shipments of items from geographical areas that are severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Preparing for infectious diseases and a response plan may be used to guide protective actions.
The plans respond to levels of risk associated with various workplaces and occupational duties, including exposure enhancements, risk factors originating in the home and community area, and risk factors of individual workers such as ageing or ageing but obese.
It also outlines the controls needed to meet those risks, and plans whatever happens for situations that may arise as a result of the spread of the disease.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of responding to the spread of the disease include reducing the ownership of personnel, protecting people at high risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing the adverse impact on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is present affects the responses carried out.
The hierarchy of risk controls is the framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to narrow risk controls according to effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 may not be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and ultimately protective equipment.
Engineering controls that involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on the origin of the worker, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are modified in the employment policy or procedure that requires action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help to avoid some of the exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, which is well suited if possible (e.g., respirators), which are continuously and appropriately worn, which are often examined, maintained, and replaced, if necessary, and appropriately removed, cleaned, and stored or discarded to prevent the
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.S., jobs with a low probability of discharge have little contact with public and other employees.
Among the basic methods of relieving infection is telecom relieving is recommended for all workplaces frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratoric relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relieving relie
The rapid identification and separation of potential potentials that can benefit individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and so on in the workplace.
The U.S. recommends that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) keep employees at home with symptoms of severe respiratory disease until they lose their fever, signs of fever, and any other symptoms that may cause, or may not cause, symptoms for at least 24 hours.
According to OSHA, occupations with less serious exposure to risk include those requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not aware or suspected of COVID-19 patients, but who may have a transmission disorder due to transmission of COVID-19, can be infected with SARS-COV-2
Included in this are the insurers who are insurers who are insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers and insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers insurers.
Workers in this endangered group will likely need the use of respirators.
If a person falls ill on a plane, including appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers from the separation of the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person's needs, and the offer of face masks to the sick person.
The cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or holding fluids on the body or potentially contaminated surface, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has a fever, fever, recurrence, or recurrence.
Gloves and other items of garbage should be discarded into the biohazard bag, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including shipping vessels and other passenger vehicles, the goods must be transported with the same baggage or other goods must be transported with the same baggage. The goods must be subject to travel delays and sickness.
It is better that medical follow-up should take place in the separate person's room. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if the infected person comes from the school building regardless of the scope of the community.
When there is a small to medium-sized transmission in the community, social distancing strategies such as cancelling field trips, assembly, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes can be implemented without the use of choir or food in a cafeteria, without the use of choirs, with the use of choirs, with the use of choirs, with the use of choirs, with the use of choirs or food in a cafeterias, with the use of choirs, with the space, without the space, with the space between tables.
If there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extended closure of the school may be considered. For staff who enforce the law on daily routine activities, the current health risk to the DC is considered to be low C according to
Official law enforcement officers who must contact individuals who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same rules as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
When close contact or close contact occurs at the time of hospitalization, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear before re-use with spray or bleaching cleaning at home, and follow the usual operating procedures for hiding and removing clothes.
OSHA considers some particular health care workers and plumbers who are in a high or very high exposure risk category.
High-risk jobs include the delivery of health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This becomes a very high risk of exposure when workers perform methods used by aerosols, or the collection or management of specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Methods of aerosol production include intubation, cough acceleration procedures, bronchoscopy, some of the dental operations and examinations, or collection of contagious specimens.
Among the high exposures to the risk of occupational grafting are workers involved in the care of human bodies who have been diagnosed or suspected of CoVID-19 at the time of their death; these are identified as grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting grafting
Specialized negative pressure ventilation can be suitable for some health care and burial arrangements.
The specimens must be managed by the Level 3 Biosafety preservative.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated from the designated waiting areas depending on whether they are a case of suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who perform, respirators for those who work or who work for 6 years.
In the United States, the N95 criminal facial respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including coverage testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirator can provide higher protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls because COVID-19 is a disease that has been exacerbated than it has been transmitted through body fluids.
Only surgical masks are recommended by the WHO for persons guilty of entering.
For those collecting breathing specimens from, caring for, or transferring COVID-19 patients without any form-of-erosol procedures, the WHO recommends surgical masks, goggles, or face masks, toga, and gloves.
When an aerosol-forming procedure is performed, an N95 or FFP2 respirator will replace the surgical mask.
Since the global supply of PPE is not adequate for the respirator, WHO recommends to reduce the need for PPE by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, it only allows those who are in direct care who are able to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, who are able to use only

We are seeing ourselves in a remarkable state of mind this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that removes our global human connection and the responsibilities that we have with each other.
We have not preceded its challenges, but we know that relying on the kind of global sympathy, cooperation, and community building placed at the heart of this association is our best response.
The heroism and care that we see in all of our colleagues via email, call, and chat is a remarkable confirmation of the amazing people who have developed to be with us.
I will not be more grateful and proud to consider all of you as fellows.
Last week, someone shared with me a thank you for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia today, and what a powerful symbol it is to keep this important resource online and accessible to everyone.
It makes your work possible, whether it's keeping places alive or paying our peers or making our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia is providing now more than ever.
This is the moment when we not only do what we do, but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role here, we will make some meaningful arrangements on how we will work together, starting next week.
Adapting to our work and schedules
Like Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the appropriate response to what we are facing and the best way to keep the organization going at this time.
We want to get rid of the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to call again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work is expected to be 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to an additional understanding.
We don't declare a holiday - if you can work a lot more normal hours, you can use the mission.
However, the world is unfamiliar today, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, choose groceries, or go to the doctor, we prioritize your interests.
We don't keep track of your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should leave without saying anything, but we say it.
It doesn't take days of sickness or PTO - just tell your caregiver and help your team to change the calendar and schedules to make sure the main workplaces are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan within T&C Ops know so T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets appropriate attention from management).
Employees who work every hour will be paid in full.
We have said, and again pledged to honour our commitments to our contractors and fellow staff who are paid for each hour of work.
Each will be paid in their normal time which will be reduced in the normal time.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you'd like to work, you'd like to work.
People use work as a way to get rid of their stress in the world around us.
What we do is very satisfying, especially at times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We would like you to speak with your supervisor, so that we can find out what to expect and adjust accordingly.
Some of the jobs are considered to be important.
There are a few things we need to keep doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may need additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to helping out what is important for our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, we just need to focus on the most important projects.
Today's slowdown is not going to hurt the most.
We do not plan to "double the time to chase" by the time the pandemic ends.
You are not expected to work extra time to meet deadlines that are now unrealistic.
We accept that conditions have changed, and will work to set new targets and timelines if appropriate.
What happened to the annual planning (app)?
In order to adapt our new reality and daily expectations to working hours, we wanted to adapt the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We aim to devise an extension to our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize important jobs, take care of themselves, and take care of those who care about their loved ones while caring for those in need or in need.
The extension of this timeline greatly reduces the current planning of the amount of work and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and update the delegates and teams in the next steps in time for us to have confirmation.
Thank you to the app team for your leadership.
Office Status, Exposure, and Cleaning
Within a week, we learned that one of our colleagues from SF was possibly exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many warnings, we took a worker to clean up against the air conditioning to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use a dispersion solution that fits the level of the hospital to disinfect each surface, as well as the corridor and elevator floors that reach our floor.
The development of its own duty-of-care protocol uses products that support the safety of their tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be ready when we decided to return.
Our office in DC is located in WeWork, which has already shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff.
Since last week, our office in DC has been changed to a fully remote setup according to the guidelines shared in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues who are based in NYC already know, we also discussed renting a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues have been working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues know that this can be a fitting, and you'd like to take some of the advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If a longer session is required, consider how they will be separated throughout the course of several days.
Describe the meeting clearly, have an agenda, and first send material to the journal.
Make video common, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to perform live collaboration and connection.
Lead the management of each meeting, a person who monitors the chat for questions and monitors the list of speakers, and a person who helps to register (or do the help-help listing).
Send an e-mail to the tech bag if you need a comfortable headset.
Make use of your wellness rebate for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
HR Operations consults on the webinar-based ergonomics guide to support the increase in distributed work throughout the Foundation.
In this past round, we asked all grant recipients in the community to cancel public-funded-wikimedia events, such as editorials, until the WHO declared that the pandemic was over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may be reasonably reasonably impossible to complete their agreed-upon activities and that no one will be punished for the occurrence of delays or changes to those purposes.
Next week we will follow-up for further guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment in the global community seems to be the sadness of destruction but the ease of clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In the meantime, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to track the impact and follow our communication with them.
Maintaining contacts around the issues related to Covid-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share updates, answer your questions and take a few hours to connect with each other.
We're here together and we're here to help whatever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important information related to COVID-19, at the Wiki Office.
The CRT keeps these pages up-to-date and puts all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with people who live in countries that are currently widely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, or major workflows, coverage challenges, or anything you might need help, don't hesitate to alert and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to assist in providing support and contacting if necessary.
If you have a sensitive or sensitive problem, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
Instead, they recognize that at this moment, our work and obligations are likely to have to stick to the way we have not been in the past.
Here are the steps that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our actions with the help they need, and in the world with the service they expect.
There we were waiting for our planned work to arrive at the end of the day.
Today, it's time to collaborate with each other and create space for important work to come in the coming weeks and potential months ahead.
We need you all to do that, and so we need you all to take care of yourself and your families so that you are at your best when there is a need.
So now please -- wash your hands and don't scratch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and in addition to the Leader's Level (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Roby A, Robyn A, Ryan To).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, rock, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of An(1-7) which makes it a reliable target drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as a complement to A2.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, along with the enzymatic active domain exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is extracted from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of major lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth organ cells of the lung.
Expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main role of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE separates the angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 binds carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Tyr-Ile-Hile).
ACE2 can also bind several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the circulation of the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and associated Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the endocytosis and translocation of both the microbe and the enzyme into the endosomes found within the cells results in the existence of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells.
The process of this entry also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the suppression in which is under current investigation as a potential therapeutic.This leads to the consideration of some that the reduction in sequential levels of ACE2,
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of the standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A systematic analysis and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors is associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."""
"Moreover, the risk of pneumonia is also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who are at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly in those with stroke and cardiac arrest."
"The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with the reduction of mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results are less stable than the overall risk of pneumonia.""
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel drug for lung damage, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Numerous findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a reliable drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or to diseases where the current angiotensin II treatment is high.
"B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help track contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may be in contact with infected individuals."
Many applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact-desktop apps.
Privacy concerns are on the rise, particularly with regard to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less disturbing alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would combine the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to know if they have infected people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as an open referral and will be given to the government. North Macedonia launched ""StopKorona!"", a Bluetooth-based application to track the exposure of potential infected people and provide a quick response to authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology (Ministry of Communication and Technology) and the Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health).
Until April 14, 2020, the app is waiting for approval of the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government said that the monitoring of the communication app is in an early stage of development, and available for expansion in a few weeks.The similar app was launched in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid")."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on the app TraceTogether of Singapore and the protocol BlueTrace. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who live in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, along with false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the app's source is limited to a small fraction of the population.
"In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps," Apple sets limits on which types of organizations may add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, regardless of whether they are "organized" or "openly limited."
Google and Amazon have enforced the same restrictions.
The campaigners expressed their concern about the implications of mass tracking using coronavirus apps, particularly as to whether the tracking information created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear when the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limitations on this type of monitoring.
The organizations have declared eight conditions in the government's projects:
"According to the law, suicide must be ""important and proportionate";"
there must be a definite expiry date for the monitoring and monitoring extensions;
the use of the data must be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
the security of data and anonymity must be protected and demonstrated to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital identity should be avoided in the face of excessive discrimination and discrimination;
any distribution of data to third parties must be specified by law;
There must be protections against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses;
"""meaningful participation by all """"relevant stakeholders""""" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued checklists."""
The proposed Google/Apple plan plans to address the problem with continuous tracking by removing the tracking mechanism from their device's operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries use location-based downloads instead of apps, removing both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid downloads.
In Israel, the network-based deployment has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; some privacy retention systems have been created that use central servers only for interaction (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to carry out communication tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects downloading information from a variety of sources including downloading data from mobile devices and data from transaction cards, and combines them to form notifications via text messages on potentially vulnerable indexes.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the location information was also made publicly available, something that was allowed due to major changes in the privacy laws of the information after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through certain apps and websites. Countries including Germany are considering the use of both centralized and retaining-private systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is a well-established concept, with a large body of research literature dating back to 2013. On the 7th of April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts used a Bluetooth device to work on solutions that recognize privacy.
However, PEPP-PT is an effort to Co-ordination with both centralized and decentralized methods, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Tracking Responsibilities (Decentralized Tracking), Decentralized Tracking Responsibilities (DP-PPT/DP-3), Decentralized Tracking Responsibilities (Decentralized Tracking Responsibilities).
In these protocols, data that refers to personal identification will never be removed from the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab forms SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy retention techniques when collecting and using cross-path or location data to track the spread of COVID-19.
"It is based on research from the whitepaper ""Apps Gone Rogue: It is based on research from the whitepaper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic""" released in March 2020." Another similar effort was MediaBlog MPrinting or the SafeTrace platform on the Enigma MPC, an Enigma MPC
SafeTrace uses secure technology hardware to allow users to share sensitive data and location with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by teams that have merged for almost identical methods and layered protocols in general, with the aim of reducing segregation, and enabling the global interoperability of print and alert apps as one.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the mobile platforms of Android and iOS, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will maintain privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography in sustaining-continence.
They also published references to the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be rolled out in three phases:
Rollout of tools to enable governments to create official maintenance of praybet coronavirus tracing apps
The merger of this feature directly with iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple is planned to address retrieval and continuous detection problems by first distributing the system through OS updates, and later removing them in the same way as soon as the threat has passed.
The repositioning of the drug (also known as the use of the drug in another way, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the use of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than the original cause of its development.
It is a line of scientific research that is currently underway to develop a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the formation of a COVID-19 vaccine and translation of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated 66 treated proteins, each of which has multiple ligand-binding components.
A reasonable project on the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins provides analysis in the areas of existence.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the paraffin protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA, et al. studied several mixed candidates who were then optimised and tested for similarity of frames at the highest similarly approved drugs to accelerate a potent development of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study.
An anti-malarial drug is chloroquine which is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine could be combined with the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that tests on New York State of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only allowed under the U.S. as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but not receiving treatment in a clinical trial.
"The CDC said that ""the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been established."
"Doctors say they use the drug when ""no other option""".
A small study on the use of chloroquine in the combination of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D was conducted by a Turkish research team in Istanbul.
Major studies are carried out in the Duke's Practice and the Oxford Practice.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and effectiveness test to prevent the use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir is ""clearly effective""".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative on a median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is inadequate and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its storage, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to Paskil in the Morning of South China (South China Morning Post), Shinzo Abe made suggestions to Trump's administration about the purchase of the drug.The drug may not be as effective in severe cases of the disease where the microbe has increased.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to have sex.
"A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that ""no observed benefit""".
Drugs are designed to prevent HIV from multiplying by the presence of protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources to re-introduce the drugs that are specifically H-formed.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the global Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections . Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and corona viruses .
One issue in antiviral treatment is the formation of resistance through changes that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some previous pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials being conducted, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate to moderate to moderate to other conditions.
There are three current clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), a breathable corticosteroid for hives, for the treatment of non-fat symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is currently allowing 200 patients to be recruited from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients experiencing mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 elderly people aged 40 and over who were screened for COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have effective contraception are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish rules for its use.
Italy announced on April 14 a multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, great scientific attention has been paid to the reuse of approved anti-viral drugs developed for earlier outbreaks such as the MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the rules of the 7th edition of China
Umifenovir: Umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the rules of the 7th edition of China

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many attempts have been made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, the infectious microbe, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates have been in the Level I safety study in April.
COVID-19 was reported in December 2019.
The spread has been a major global outbreak in 2020, leading to large investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
It was said in April, the requirements for the CEPI initiative for vaccine development were speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale shipping, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in the early part of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main goals of the platform that advances in the safety studies of Phase I include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273) Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 total vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 being confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others being planned, but with little or no information available to the public.
A Level I-II test that carries out the initial safety and immunogenicity test, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and in many places, while referring to more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the best dose.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates that are active ingredients (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (in ""preclinical"" research yet)".
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the Queensland Practice announced that it is investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine changing the genetic proteins of the microbe to signal an immune response.

In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company announced that they will have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and their chosen vaccine can begin testing in humans by the time of autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced US$4.9 million investment in a research consortium for COVID-19 vaccines involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners for COVID-19 vaccine development are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, health officials in Russia announced that scientists had already begun the animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
A vaccine candidate has been developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million of funding for 96 research projects in medical measures to combat COVID-19, including a number of candidates to vaccinate Canadian companies and universities, such as the University of Medica and initiatives.
"At nearly the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" of some new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh School of Medicine (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine) reported on the analysis of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in rats, which has been confirmed to have "anti-sustained MNA with SARS-CoV-2."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA as a possible nose spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to form harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to form antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities opened up resources for access to supercomputers from IBM, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, which are also called uncertain effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are suffering from.
An additional non-selective trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective.
Early research to test the efficacy of the vaccine using animal models specifically in COVID 19, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates a need for co-ordinated responses to biosafety-level 3 viruses, internal control measures and control measures.
Non-human animal models tested vaccines against SARS and MERS.
As of 2020, no drug or protective vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that has completed phase I in clinical trials in humans, and three others are being performed, all viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1-VV-MERS), and one adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1-V-MERS).
Social media posts have advocated a conspiracy theory that says the virus behind COVID-19 is already known and now has a vaccine available.
The patents mentioned by various social media outlets refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of the coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle soreness, tingling, swelling of the throat, odorlessness, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually within five days but it can last from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and pneumonia of many organs.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spreading among people with close contact, often through small droplets caused by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
While these small droplets form when exhaling, they usually fall to the ground or to surfaces rather than become polluted over long distances.
People can also be relieved by touching the contaminated area and following the touch of their eyes, nose or throat.
The microbe is able to live at peaks up to 72 hours.
It is completely contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible even before the symptoms show up and in the last stages of the disease. The standard method of analysis is to trace the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a
The use of masks is recommended for people who suspect they have had microbes and their guardians.
There are different recommendations for the use of masks in the general public, where some authorities recommend against its use, some recommend using it, and others order its use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drug for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has already been recorded in almost all countries in all six WHO regions.
It is infected by the microbe can be asymptomatic or cause flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Symptoms of emergency include difficulty breathing, recurrent pain or chest tightness, confusion, difficulty getting up, and swelling of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Unusually, upper respiratory symptoms such as swelling, sneezing or swelling of the throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as dizziness, vomiting, and vomiting are observed at different percentages.
A few cases in China have initially only presented chest congestion and tremors.
In some, the disease can grow in pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will continue for 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people develop symptoms.
Its role as asymptomatic carriers in transmission has not yet been fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be the cause of the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is still being studied, reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20% of all confirmed cases remained symptom-free at the time of their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unmarked cases in its field cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were unmarked at the time of examination.
Both dura and saliva can carry many viruses.
Loud speech emits more small droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered bowel movements can produce tiny droplets that travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not from the air in general, the National Academy of Science suggests that bioaerosol transfer may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside human chambers have obtained samples positive for viral RNA.
Several medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that will become aerosols and thus result in airborne dispersion.
While there are concerns that it can spread through debris, this risk is believed to be low. The microbe is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while the spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person in general can infect two to three others. The virus lives for several hours or days in infected objects.
In particular, the virus was found to be present one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the temperature and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used correctly; soap products weaken the beneficial barrier layer of the microbe, kill it, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken between two days after the beginning of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day examined.
Severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new serious respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus, first separated from three people with pneumonia associated with cases of severe respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 microbe have been traced to the related coronaviruses that are inherent in nature.
Outside the human body, the microbe is killed by a house flower, where the bubble that protects it explodes. SARS-CoV-2 is close to being linked to the original SARS-CoV.
Lung organs are most affected by COVID-19 because the microbe accesses the host cells by the enzyme angiotensin-generative-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar lung cells.
The microbe uses a special external glycoprotein called "spike" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Severe heart damage has been found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and it is more common in severe illness.
The number of cardiovascular symptoms is high, caused by systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders as the disease progresses, but acute myocardial injury can also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors have a high presence in the heart and are associated with heart function.
High incidences of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with poor prognosis or diagnosis of the disease. Autopsies of people who have died of COVID-19 have been observed.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, there are symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation in patients with severe COVID-19.
Unfortunately, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the recruitment of IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsy.
The WHO has published some of the diagnostic protocols for the disease.
The standard method of analysis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The analysis was customarily done on respiratory samples obtained a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasopharyngeal swab or plema sample can also be used.
The results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken between the two weeks and the results have a small, easy-to-use value.
Chinese scientists have isolated the strain of the coronavirus and published a genetic result so that laboratories around the world can freely develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus' infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (where it is possible to see active comforts and even a person has been infected by the past) are in progress, but not yet extensively used.
Chinese test experience showed that the absolute accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care examination on the 21st of March 2020 for use at the end of the said month. Guidelines for the good recognition of the characteristics of a disease ruled by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University have suggested special procedures for the monitoring of epidemiological baseline infections.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal folding with different alveolar fillings), and mating may occur with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main causes of autopsy are the following:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary constriction and pulmonary irrigation
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
weak lung: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe lung: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, performing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or lips.
The CDC recommends clamping the groin and nose using a tissue when shrinking or degrading and recommends using the elbow lining if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after any coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of fabric face coverings in the public, in part in limiting the transmission of asymptomatic individuals. The purpose of social distancing strategies is to reduce the exposure of infected people to large groups in the context of the closure of schools and hospitals.
Guidelines for distancing also include that people sign at least 6 feet (1.8m) apart.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Because the vaccine will be unreliable until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of COVID-19 management is testing to reduce the epidemic outbreak, known as ""flattening the curve""".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after dressing or when the hands are seen dirty, before eating and after waking, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and water available. For areas where there are no hand sanitizers, the WHO provides two exemptions for local production.
In these formulations, anti-microbial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptics""".
Glycerol is added as a wetting residual or humectant.
People are managed with care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of having the virus should wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is already being used to respond to the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Personal cleanliness and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended for assessing immunity.
The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people who have been hospitalized with Covid-19, which are of great help to people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of arrhythmia.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have listed a free source of treatment recommendations from various agencies, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no definitive treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, especially in the area of health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends putting people in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIR) in addition to the use of standard precautions, contact precautions and air-tightening precautions. The CDC outlines the protections.
The recommended gear is: Recommended clothing is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (rather than facemasks) are preferred.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial areas but the FDA has allowed those masks to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect from particles from airborne particles such as dust but the effectiveness against a particular biological agent is not guaranteed for unbranded uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks, or as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not very serious for requiring mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals associated with COVID-19 respiratory depression is currently actively being studied for people in hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided at the threshold of high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Either of these two are going to the same benefit for people who are suffering from a severe illness is not known.
Some doctors prefer to remain with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of small particle aerosols compared to high cannula flow in the nose. The severe case is most common in older adults (you are over 60 years old, and especially in older eyes).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, if either sets the capacity of a health care system to handle a sudden influx in the number of COVID-19 cases that is more severe for hospitalization needs.
A study in China found that 5% had been introduced into protective units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% had died.
In China, nearly 30% of people in hospitals with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated because acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) forms in COVID-19 and oxygen delivery becomes difficult.
Fans capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to increase excess oxygen transport while reducing the risk of damage to the lungs of the fan and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be used in old fans.
In January 2020, research into potential therapies was confirmed, and some antiviral drugs were in clinical trials.
Remdesivir produces the most reliable.
Although new drugs may be available until 2021 for development, some of the drugs that have been tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the forefront of testing.
Antiviral medications can be tested in people with severe illness.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is poor or worsening.
It is not subject to clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect "close contact" using the identification data and therefore a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the state of the other three users.
When you see the potential risk, not only does the app self-quarantine recommend, but it also offers local health officials. Big data analytics on cell phone data, face-recognizing technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track people who are trapped.
In March 2020, the Israeli government mobilized security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may be infected with mildly infected.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the combined phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and suppress the spread of the virus.
Russia has disseminated facial recognition technology to catch the quarantine offender.
"Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said that he was informed by mobile phone operators that ""40% of people continue to rotate anyway""".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also made a global call for creative solutions to fight the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals have experienced anxiety from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of self-harm.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""The rising social divide, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn is the perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."""
The disease may have a mild course with little or no symptoms, which is similar to other common upper respiratory ailments such as normal sneezing.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while your patients with severe or critical ailments can reach three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 deficiency based on data from other desirable microbes, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 may be associated with the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In people most severely affected, COVID-19 can spread rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory depression, septic shock or multiple organ suffocation.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, was reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal rock activity was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were used in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and postmortem.
In a study of previous cases, the median time from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes have observed viral cytopathic changes.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart injury was observed with elevated levels of troponin or heart attack.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of hospitals already have previous conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of the number of deaths from the condition vary due to differences in regions, but also due to difficulties in methodologies.
The low count of average cases can lead to an excess of computation in the number of deaths.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases obtained in the past may mean that the current death toll is less than estimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than non-smokers. Concerns have been cited about long-term succession of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found that the fall was 20% to 30% in the lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease and a lung scan suggested organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known if the past infection provides effective and long-term survival of the disease to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen to be likely, based on the action of other coronaviruses, but in cases where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for the coronavirus at a later date reported.
These cases are believed to exacerbate a long-term comfort rather than re-impairment.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated from the animal, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely advanced by human-to-human coffee.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO have reported that the earliest release of symptoms appears to be December 8, 2019.
A few steps are commonly used to count the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the pre-emergence outbreak, and population types such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, the WHO designated emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for those who died from confirmed laboratory infection with SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for those who died from clinical or epidemiologically-diagnosed cases of COVID-19.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths was 6.9% (153,822/240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies per region. Other estimates cover the case fatality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of considered individuals who died from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected individuals who died from a disease.
These statistics are not time-determined and follow a certain population from ease by resolution.
While not all people form antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people are infected.
At the centre of the outbreak of the disease in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival pilasters, and spread to younger populations, resulting in relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths can be formally referred to as such.
In addition, the German health system is not overcrowded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as experienced from blood donors.
It was confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the number of deaths are different for both men and women.
The number of male deaths is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at their age of 50, with the field between men and women closing only at 90.
In China, the death toll was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this difference in sex are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be the cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, low prevalence of smoking in women and men who develop similar adverse conditions such as hypertension in younger age than in women may have resulted in higher mortality in men.
In Europe, men account for 57% of infected individuals and men for 72% of COVID-19 deaths.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked data on gender-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that infectious diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on both men and women.
The higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO represents for the corona, VI for the microbe, D for the disease, and 19 for when the outbreak of the disease was first identified: 31 December 2019. 31 December 2019.

"WHO additionally uses ""the COVID-19 virus"" and ""covid-19-causing virus"" in public communications."
Both the disease and the microbe are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the microbe and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV respiratory diseases as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines against the use of disease locations and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health care materials such as nasal swabs and fan parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital is forced to require a fan valve, and the supplier is unable to deliver the required time, a local certified inverse discharge and prints the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incorrect information emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
Humans have emerged with the ability to spread the virus to some animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral folding in pigs, ducks, and poultry.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is carried out by government organizations, academia groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Trial" to assess the effects of the treatment of four existing antiviral mixtures with expected efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Formerly made with SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three types of vaccinations that are being investigated.
First, researchers are aiming to develop an entire vaccine against the virus.
The use of the said microbe, whether inactive or dead, aims to achieve an early immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 pandemic.
A secondary strategy, vaccines subunits, aims to produce a vaccine that senses the immune system in certain microbial subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Vaccines have been experimented from anywhere its strategies will be developed for safety and effectiveness. On the 16th of March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine was initiated in four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to vaccine formation for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials currently underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials examined approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hyroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The anti-viral drugs given the new use make up most of the Chinese research, with nine phase III tests on remdesivir in some countries expected to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical progress for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was established, as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs have been examined for the treatment of COVID-19, including remgravirine, chlorinavir, and hydroxychloroquine.
This is temporary evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir, until March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine previously used in the treatment of malaria was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer-reviews.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which while recommending an empty dose of one gram, recommends that the dose twice it is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an authorization for emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the capacity of doctors to treat people with COVID-19. Also in the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines interferon, ribavirin or COVBAN-19 saphenovirine for use include.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for additional in vivo studies after low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition have been shown. Studies have shown that the pre-preparation of the spike protein of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) by ceyon AV2 receptor-Co-RS for SA intake is significant.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin have limitations that prevent the medical community from covering it with therapies without additional study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. It is not known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the final stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may be characterized as an anti-cytokine storm. Tocilizumab has already been included in the treatment guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after completing a small study.
It undergoes a phase 2 of a non-randomised analysis at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to point out cytokine storms, it is intended to measure such outcomes, which are thought to have caused the deaths of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA base in previous cases of studies for the treatment of steriod refractory cytokine release syndrome initiated by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
Currently, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of isolated and concentrated antibodies formed by the immune systems of people who survived COVID-19 to people in need of it is being investigated as a method of vaccine-free passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with non-final results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action where passive antibody therapy can stimulate the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other types of antibody therapy, for example, the use of created monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Blood production from the cured person, consisting of a liquid portion of the blood from the cured patients and containing antibodies specifically to this virus, can be measured for faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after reporting on the spread of the virus.
