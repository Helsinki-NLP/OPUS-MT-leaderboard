Sundarbany s<0xC5><0x8D>m is the world's most pristine namorzin<0xC5><0x8D>w belt, and is located on the 80 km (50 mi) long coastline of the Bangladeshi and Indian rivers.
Sundarbans were listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The tajla of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are, however, ino navigable barges, but also niickers from the eastern stews of the slender jungle, which somehow covered the gangesko g<0xC5><0xAB>wnia.
