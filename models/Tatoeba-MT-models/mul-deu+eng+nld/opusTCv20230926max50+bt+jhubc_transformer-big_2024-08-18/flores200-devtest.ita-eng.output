The USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need on the part of the Olympic community to strive to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC said, that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by bringing about a significant change within our organization, rather than by decertification.
USA Gymnastics has promoted an independent investigation to understand how it was possible that an abuse of the dimensions described so courageously by those who managed to survive Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long, and is willing to implement any necessary or appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a reliable, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides greater details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feather of this animal was brown brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's feathering is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called rachids, but instead has other typical features of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the rachids are probably the result of an evolutionary development following such features.
The feather structure suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that while it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows a feather as an adult and not a chicken feather.
According to the researchers’ hypothesis, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult feather rather than that of a chick.

The effect sought by the team was to be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a tidal force of attraction on Earth, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same as that of "normal" matter.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of alone, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Candidates can send their representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the volunteers perform the calculation of the votes under strict control, in accordance with the specific procedures.

Huhne resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to assume the role of Minister for Business left vacant by Davey.
Huhne and Pryce will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and 21-year-old driver Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla reported injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo face reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun didn't explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blinded by one eye, lacks a section of skull, and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconferencing from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two single championship races.
The first in the slalom, where on the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 out of 116 competitors in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which he participated, the giant slalom, saw him rank tenth in the women's group in the "sitting" category, with a combined journey time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than Dany<0xC3><0xB8>i G'ung in ninth place.
Four women’s group skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 Giant Slalom participants did not qualify in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have also found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their face covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Despite this, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on the charge of killing her own son.
She is detained pending trial and trial, but any testimony made by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has other parameters; in fact, Scottish courts have considered the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects, walk on a mined ground.”
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for the legal proceedings, told reporters that no new comments will be released at least until the formal indictment.
According to the above, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
Shooters within the experimental program for control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O’Flynn, acting director of NPWS’s Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly has sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country toward new elections, including the resignations of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that challenge the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure of the elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 overheating-related incidents, which the company called “not serious.”
In its response, the ministry called the report “absolutely deplorable” by Apple.
The quake at Marianne was reported at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage was reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza set fire to tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released immediately along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was hit to death.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After graduating in obstetrics, she went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
Her research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two “black boxes” with flight records.
His fellow wrestlers also wanted to pay homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
"Luna was weird like me... Maybe even more... I love her well and I will miss her... We hope she's in a better place," said Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia’s transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said he believes Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast to the poll, 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal should have competed in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but it blamed several disturbances that led to doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, i.e. matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed and in particular how the Earth was formed, having clashed with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he placed his signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, the speculations are nothing more than “political gossip and stupidity.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than the obsolete ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transport is not being extended and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, while on-site parking for cars or interchange parking is not available.
Fears related to the absence of the means of transport have highlighted the possibility of having the game obligatory in closed doors, without the support of the fans of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds was born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from the University of Princeton, USA, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much greater; this was due to the coupling of an endemic fringe of Darwin, Geospiza impitus, and Geospiza de il fortes.
Gold can be worked in any kind of shape. It can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin wire, suitable to be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice you can build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been torn off (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, inject them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on their hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water equipped with a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewage networks have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted into public toilets, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket is more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has greatly changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, squirrels and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret to their success, a particular goal that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion branch acts in a very similar way to the wolf or dog branch, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not that of other large cats), also with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a tensile force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat thanks to the smell, sniffing on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots mimic the surrounding environment and then lead them on.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (e.g., if it moves across a mountain chain or river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different features or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it is becoming less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is inhaled by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide ejected from them (through exhalation).
Plants process their own nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses from plants and produce clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus were the superpredator of his era and therefore he feared nothing but the other Mosasaurus.
From his long cheeks sprang more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row on his palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed his path.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that it had a fork tongue. Its feed included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also envisaged various strange or unusual dishes, such as turkey, turkey, snails, and a kind of rodent called ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women were eating while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have dinner together lying on a side while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include different foods, which arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
The people sacrificed to the gods and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to God.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the life of the Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, while the shops were simple outdoor benches overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who named it, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, at that time the Eskimos tribes already lived there.
Although all Scandinavian countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you’ve seen the movie “The Mystery of the Templars,” you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is drawn a map of the treasure.
However, this is false. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measure 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be reset.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was intended only as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had led northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, or those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive took the name "Operation Dragon".
American forces and those of the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization is a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civility derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is, citizen, and "civitas", that is, city or city-state, and thus in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, not being recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was its only component, according to the Statute of the Confederacy.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, in the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperatively, for the implementation of its acts.
He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was required; these on their part had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more common in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipel", considered the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who transited from there slowly registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation involving Aboriginal cereal production systems and hiring Chinese brewers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Window.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still underway.
The most common format in the world for fixed-image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the format 35 mm is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many common formats (for example, the APS family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often neglected rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which has become rich and powerful, has struggled to be under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a sticker among European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary reserves of the Church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the onset of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it envisaged the discontinuation of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and hardships of World War I, the nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: every period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called period of the Three Kingdoms, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these times, fierce wars were raging among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to gain a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and lucky to succeed.
The same is true for the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on calibre.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear picture of Muhammad’s spirituality.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you knew its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or feel very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has arrived to this day not in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "bow-up" resembles a V and the indication "bow-down" resembles a graffiti or square without the lower side.
Up means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the alamaro (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc results in a louder, firmer sound.
You may decide to add your personalized pencil indications, but keep in mind that the archetypes you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in the predilection of terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Maria Antonietta, their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and to Elizabeth, the king's sister.
In a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage open.
At one point someone from the crowd showed the frightened queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains arising from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the gains at the base of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which concluded by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that the destiny of man is driven by a underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of mass cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, dealt with by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time there have been usages, customs, and culture related to this geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a centre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was under the strong influence of Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the communication routes causes the spread of styles in the West to be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of organic type, that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, much of the farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures share individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a set of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who have grown up without proper socialization with adults by negligence, as a result of misfortune, or as a result of intentional abuse.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a severe intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered serious violence or trauma before leaving or fleeing.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, much more a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but it is also the small graffiti-shaped assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are given in trust for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nutrition, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that the trust represents a safe zone for these children.
Our trust system should provide safe homes, loving trustee parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The trust is supposed to surpass all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratification.
For example, as important motivations for the use of the Internet, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, i.e. hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy their need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us it is difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors have solved their “protein problem” in a way like the savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal period of sleep, followed by a restart (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice using a relatively silent awakening to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you completely.
If you decide to reset the watch in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming many fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach the illumination. This objective is hindered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayana ritual and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is founded in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the focal point of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts caused the breakup between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years, and it would be really fought by mercenary armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, Polish defense had already collapsed; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, proved immediately obsolete, at a time when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the multi-lateral treaty of non-aggression, the Soviet-Polish and other bilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has always been to ensure that the country safeguards its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time opposing the ability of the enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the recent and most notable examples in support of this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by cultures and tribes of antiquity to have readily available milk, fleece, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were usually bred in herds left free to move on hills or in other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (like shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
In the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply formed by parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that rode them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The rails were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the rails would have been more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first means of transport that man has known were the legs. Humans began to walk in an erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erected man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal walking are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also make activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If, instead, we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
In the night they were produced between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap's posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the court of Independence Hall and was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his room troops in New York on 9 July, while a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 borders of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript was lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that combine them with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on the two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of encoded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all the computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check that there are first aid instructions on the label for that specific poison.
The term acarus is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have adapted strongly to become human parasites.
Both the killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nested, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their guest.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) records about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a pathology that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the chances of developing MS among females are double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or that of their own child.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it’s not just about experimentation, because an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows you to orient scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific roots.
In many, they observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not only reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells concerned belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on the spot include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns to go to work by car, intersecting other people whose workplace is the place they’ve just left.
In this dynamic direction, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints concerning water quality or bridges that fall into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers designing them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall into a reasonably constant range, so in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) range, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to highlight the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape more easily from the enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small swarms to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are the libella and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), was moving around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the total water flowing from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and contains the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
They continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These are in fact more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would turn into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so trillions of them could enter the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil then turned out to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to an increasingly less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has the need to approach a temperamatite.
We can only ask ourselves what fate will have the keyboard when something new arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission pump.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy trolley on a hill, so by further dividing the core, part of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down in the presence of a weak thrust or nothing.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called a crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the rise of the lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people share and push them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
A manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
On the other hand, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire operation of the team and do it himself.
Ultimately, the leader is the person ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the point of contact function for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings can take place depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each member refers and which sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to face the long process that leads to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning can be innovation.
When you manage to effectively use all the resources available in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s needs.
In order for an organization to define itself innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is at the heart of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some application examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, vocal and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but earlier versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgements the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to feed the public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students’ learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s suggestive and bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wild lands.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising to many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent by itself.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury resorts, are mostly independent or associated with France.
In the Arab lands they also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route, ranging from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way to European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travellers: it is recommended that everyone declares that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they regard as a harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and be not afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, nargile and a lot of chincaglieria, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document yourself well before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa’s mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuct<0xC3><0xB9>" ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decaying city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the special of Henry Louis Gates of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more arabic touch than African, the city is distinctly different from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located to the northeast of South Africa and is located to the east along the border with Mozambique, to the north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which feeds a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for the conservation and entry to the park.
Buying a Wild Card might also be helpful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development has focused on the heavily populated reclaimed land off the northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start from.
The Sundarbans are the widest coastal mangrove range in the world, extending for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of forest included in the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to have 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because often the service buses between different districts are full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy Japanese small buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby places, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two tracks have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two 3.50 meters wide lanes.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
By September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge is expected to be fully operational.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-weekly hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribe groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who lived on hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of India", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas polo fields, the most important tournament of the year is held.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches also at other times of the year.
To receive information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank of the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. At Stanley you can often pay also with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that on the outlying islands they do not accept credit cards, although UK and U.S. currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of Falkland Islands outside the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30<0xC2><0xB0>C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, deer, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they have not maintained an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port was the sadly known naval stable of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships, except one British cruiser, were sunk, with nearly 200 lives lost in the United States and Germany.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
It is mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can take a bath safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could better cope with the trip.
The tap water in the place is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to the Australians, flat white coffee comes from a foreign idea. Espresso is short black coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on the same level as Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year there are many excursions on the coral reef and injuries for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow the instructions and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can only occasionally be found.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often make agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers to/from the airport or even combined flight <0x2B> hotel packages.
They may also keep the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on site, considering this as a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and gain a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the crossing of the ice causes rather annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include the time spent exploring the city. Cruise passengers are granted the exemption from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do their best to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Typically, there are no windows, nor watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests high in the mood to make sure they stay.
In some venues, alcoholic beverages are offered by the home. However, the state of intoxication alters judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On ice and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you can’t drive like when you’re on clean asphalt.
During a snow buffalo, in a very short time so much snow can fall that you get stuck.
Even precipitation and snowflakes, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle’s windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the focal point of many visitors’ vacation.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips made by land, especially in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good look.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid and therefore it is possible to observe them better with the binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, in fact the first Olympic Games were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but most of the coronavirus-related cancellation policies, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most tickets for events is expected to be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while normal tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear stretched socks, you can try with a hair dryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to expose fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt, it is appropriate to consider the purchase of packaged water inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers can come in contact with animal parasites that are not common in their home regions.
Parasites can disrupt food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax- and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that presents the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is recommended to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow alleys and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict compliance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area, the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste small but rich sweets, you can focus on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used for curry in inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specifications, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a range of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the feet of the knight and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems for the possibility that the rider’s feet remain stuck there.
If a puppet is swung by a horse but has a foot embedded in the bracket, it could be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the English ones, inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of huge granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from every part of the world continually trace new paths on its potentially infinite walls.
Free-sleeping snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very common and provide snow sliding thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums", who devote whole periods of holiday to skiing activity in a particular area.
The principle at the base of skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings with the representation of skiing humans date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste, mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is connected, although it usually does not include them, to skiing or skiing, which are practiced on rugged terrain and require much stiffer skis and shoes.
Think of the ski slope as a trail similar to the hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances somewhat larger than those on walking trails, but very rarely you will reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would need to apply for a visa and pass for passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass the passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider this an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences from the age limit that may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Artisan objects could be defined as antique pieces, though more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all S<0xC3><0xA1>mi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived in fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Tourism is an important source of income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the territory of the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "single" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a traveller warning should be issued for the destination you are visiting, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your travel insurance in case of cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term used to refer to any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social distress or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, more than normal precipitation and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to storms, tornadoes, storms and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of high regional and seasonal intensity are storms, snow blows, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inform themselves about the adverse weather conditions that affect their area, as they may affect their travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a potentially significant country as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who are planning surgery to change their sex abroad must make sure they have the valid documents for the return trip.
The intention of governments to issue passports without indications of sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections have also become much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the checks without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rising currents consist of the return flow of waves that break down on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in the attempt to swim countercurrent, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the water, going back to swimming won’t be harder than usual.
Try to find an area where you’re not at risk of being trapped again, or consider whether you’re waiting for help, based on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (there is a much smaller "honeymoon" phase), it lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes have difficulty re-adapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and you will have lost some of the uses of your native culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and inclusive people, aware of the fact that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return home.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is all the more interesting there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Usually you can always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a cell phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the view clears to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational craft, including recreational craft, as well as missions that need data and voice remotely.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
One of the more and more popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among neo-diplomats, since it can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education once you return to your home country.
Usually, enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
There is no need for a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national hobby of Finland, where one boat counts every seven or eight people.
This is also true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
You will not need a separate visa (since 2009) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest toward other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming fear based on what is unknown, or on not having control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it to you faster would be to ship it as your luggage. And that's where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or in business class the most obvious way is to pay a good amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for first-class trips!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably to their destination, and therefore apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and its own currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between the two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox religion.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Smyrna develops on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although the city breathes an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are dotted with characteristic red brick roofs, the 18th century market and mosques and antique churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church sanctuary, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant account of its splendor written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 line bus regularly connects to Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great sanctuary of the Madonna of Fatima (place of worship), place of famous Marian apparitions around the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived in these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or put to work to death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid distorting these places by embracing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority of them are able to understand it; Spanish is known to virtually everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In the metro, regular ads are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, ruthless, and presumptuous.
Even though it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to be good in Paris remains to behave best, relating to yourself as a "ben été" (well educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rude exterior appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you get rid of some good basic ways.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly of beech, peaches and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels it presents a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a huge variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, goose, lynx, wild cat and cedar cock, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries provide stalls for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants down to the bottom of their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular dinner typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "You", always begin with the capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel that follows.
Also, be sure to pronounce "r" and "r" differently: dear means blessed, while trolley means carriage.
The Persian has a relatively simple and regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and sentence comprehension.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Today, premodern observatories are usually outdated and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their golden age did not pose a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most of the modern telescopes intended for research are huge structures in sparse areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first festivals for the flowering of cherries were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" a copy.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the distance from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to tour; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropical", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the warm (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland watercourses can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of well-known hiking trails and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition envisages spending the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to be able to admire the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations at the basis of this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches, an Easter vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations that often start the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came to us by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not cope with the journey, which caused the giant turtle to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats have been introduced to the Galapagos since the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are poorly populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office clothing usually consists of a jacket and tie or waistcoat and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or with the professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it attaches importance to the group's commitment rather than praise individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the welfare of their superiors on every decision, and they are expected to adhere to the instructions without asking questions.
