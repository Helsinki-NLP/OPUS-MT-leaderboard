Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about "passing for puppets"
Welsh MPs are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of railroading.
An elected Labour leader said his group was concerned that the acronym “rimes with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers not native to Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crutch.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be “open” to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (puppet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, said that "the final decision on the appointment of the members of the Assembly rests with the latter".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 (Government of Wales Act, 2007) gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission leans in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefers MWP.
Members of the House appear to be making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real headline for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the House, who is expected to submit a name change bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the name issue during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on the change of the name of the country
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be known as the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbour, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
“The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church at every corner of the street,” says Adams.
“There is no more at all today.”
He said it was normal for bars to be sparse.
Today, “we don’t date in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“We used to go to the bar like at the neighbor’s house, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before what the officials imagined, and this worries him: "Sooner or later, they will return to the starting box."
He added that churches could be replaced by complexes of condominiums, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be Whites who will precipitate the closure of all churches, as they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, who was preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, where Blacks were painting to be employed or to get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
Father Johnson’s son and successor to the leadership of St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “bells of the poor people.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played in July, gave her a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
She also mentions that this is the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago took place in front of the larger carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been much debate about the relocation of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose the costs incurred on him, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: A 13-Year-Old Injured by a Shark During a Hummer Fishing Game
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television station, that he had been diving with friends since half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was pushing shouts of joy for having had a grip, and then he realized that in reality he was
He had been bitten.
Arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
“I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark!” says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is not known.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the chest.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the UK Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's makes low hand on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnishes them with rays similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion aesthetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive rays of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others.
Supermarkets are investing in the beauty market today in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space in areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of non-animal-tested products, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, fragrance seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second one, which is scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads in order to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to make their purchases online and head to nearby grocery stores for everyday food.
Mike Coupe, general manager of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will increasingly look like big areas as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to drive sales of current consumer goods and to profitate acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetics rays of the British chain had been unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended after a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies located in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing in 4 stores a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the framework for the customer.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide informed advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the beautification of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes purchasing habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragon's Den TV star Peter Jones has announced the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract related to her home decor brand to dedicate herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have the time to take care of the interior decoration and accessories brand Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning animator announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their successful textile and interior decoration business at the last minute to dedicate herself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV's darling child revealed, during a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den commercial star's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, with Truly's access, at a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, would not allow him.
The truly brand was likened to actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's estimated fortune at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped in her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside of Britain.
According to a source, “Truely was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It is about to secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe the departure of This Morning’s host, who is one of Britain’s most “banking” celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to the company, due to significant investments in products ranging from pillows or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a recurrence.
In addition, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couple went on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as animator of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business.
The debate was heated, but in the end we loved each other.
Trump has ridiculed the media criticizing him for his comment that some consider “a president unworthy,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He snarled, taking a voice from a TV journalist.
“I gave up nothing at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting after Trump called the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday not to see any “corresponding” U.S. response to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his rallying speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic outlook.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” the US president said.
We broke the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full-fledged arena, there are barely more than 200 standing in front of me,” he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, assistance from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was scattered, but no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for the triggering of international aid.
“Unfortunately, many times they made it clear that they did not want international help, which complicates things a bit,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, she still doesn’t know if fieldwork will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant tremors, the country lacks the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm sirens have recalled Palu, which has undoubtedly contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed the reform of the devastated infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums to re-establish roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr. Joko's government, called to stand before voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, amid clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge wins the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a Liverpool Premier League defeat to Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot the ball on his left, before escaping a shot towards the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to get in place, get the ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far away as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking much about it, I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward made a step towards Mateo Kovacic, before turning to the midfield and sprinter side Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick go-and-go in the middle of the field,
and then made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard went beyond defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the record of the earthquake and tsunami accounted for 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the debris of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of hitting Woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman stabbed was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who may have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I call on taxi drivers, in particular, who might have caught something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any critical information for our investigation.”
A police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property where she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confided that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the spot,
Repeatedly, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the Crime Failure Agency anonymously at 0800 555 111, as indicated by the September 30 Register 247.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
His ban would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of innumerable religious and cultural goods of England, committed by his Puritan supporters, such as fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considered Mr. Crick’s proposal “unreasonable” and called it a “revisionist attempt.”
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, “Given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s one erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither commanded nor conducted the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell’s superb representation, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the consideration we had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century, than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean, of course, the monarchy.
The fact that this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector deserve to be highlighted and commemorated as well.”
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a market dump in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pig barn on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby porch was open.
He claims that there was a huge male pig inside and that blood was coming out of his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the 250 kg animal mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered with blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the breeder or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent any other incidents and allow police to collect evidence.
The family of the breeder Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be in the process of negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, swine attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring him.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stabbed a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get him out of it.
In 2012, when a Oregon breeder had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he was not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re animals rather than players.
very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them,” he assures.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves above the colder waters of Mexico's northeastern coast.
However, Rosa will cause atrocities in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows to the east, towards the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa in the northeastern United States will cause an intense tropical rainfall.
It will rain as much as 25 cm in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of up to 2.5 to 10 cm will cause sudden dangerous floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Avers will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour at locations, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into detached rivers, and storms will produce wind gusts and dust whirlwinds in places.
The impending depression will result in heavy local rains in some parts of the southern California coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rainforests will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall in all corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
This sometimes leads to a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer from significant temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures revolving around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
Several-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above the average in the eastern United States during the first fifteen days of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on 6 television channels on Thursday, the striking hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political impasse persists, broadcasters interrupted Friday’s usual program to announce a comeback: an agreement devised by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had committed to touching her person and had tried to remove her clothes during an evening between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% sure that it had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people who watch TV in the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators widely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on the day of the hearing, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
It was followed by CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not decrease once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was set on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras revealed a scene in which the senator is taken to the side by protesters as he tries to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN relayed the sequence of the live interpellation.
“Don’t look anywhere else, look at me,” one of the women says.
“Do you really think he’s telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are destitute.”
Before the elevator doors were closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All the cable and broadcast network channels covered the live session a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the Senate as a whole.
Flake said, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the accusations made against the candidate, which minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after speaking with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault charges.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making “little policy”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of her plan to leave the European Union, to make “little policy” at the expense of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on cover, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, stating that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was “actually ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the cause of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, has been stabbed and is charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Service said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the forensic doctor of the parish of Baton-Rouge published Friday a preliminary report, which determines that the death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the medical-legal laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and quest for justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grows up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said the team was “devastated and shocked” after the news of Wayde’s death.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico: a volcanic crater of ash
From the ash escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several tremors and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the approach of the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not disperse tourists.
Squadrons also erupted later in the day, while police were using mattresses to contain the clashes.
For several hours, independence groups chanting "neither forget nor forgive" faced unionist supporters shouting "long life in Spain".
Fourteen protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of the separation, tensions remain alive in the independent region.
An overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence, despite a low turnout, as opposition to the secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
This was still the case, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“We witnessed a great deal last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a stalemate,” he laments.
Despite their capital victory, albeit slim, in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained while waiting to be judged for organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, says politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on one side as well as on the other.
“The tension is only rising,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison pending a judgement since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Londonderry Arrest: Men Hit House by Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after eclipsing a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also said to have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently climbed to the ranks, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games to Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to take second place in the standings, on an equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and must face the Hearts team, which leads by 8 points on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Viennese Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she extends her undefeated career in the division by 6 games, and her head coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that she has not yet lost the slightest match.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of angry opponents
Holt's team could have gone ahead long before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to puncture but remained flat in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a pass from Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could interfere with them through hard-working tactics.
This is where the decisive goal comes in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half was at the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers keeper Allan McGregor stopped a hit from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to deflect one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's keeper repulsed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul of hand.
The “Phenomenon” of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have practically not changed since their return to the top, but the merit is largely due to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
It has a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in breath throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they have not been up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and only managed to break through the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan's warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to spot their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, have voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him in his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and called an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on the spot, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and to warn his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been put in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 Agents Injured in Rebellion
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riots began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, and it is still not under control.
Specialised counter-insurgency officers were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a wing of the prison.
On the spot, the agents were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison management spokesperson said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, are being held in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-rebellion officers were sent to prison to curb a serious disturbance: inmates had attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's probably what's going to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading toward the southwestern desert with what's left of its energy. This region could be affected by sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcing rains starting Monday night.
The National Weather Service, based in Phoenix, said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm within a perimeter of 300 km around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest estimates predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwest desert including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least one extreme category drought, the second most severe category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coasts of the Lower California peninsula.
Still with great power on Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at 20 km/h.
The storm hits the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some areas of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Tsunami rains are expected in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in sudden, potentially fatal floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4 a.m. local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police said they arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night on the Radstock side.
Officers made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Was a Victim of the Wickedness and Anger of Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the evil and anger of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress Thursday, rebuffing with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” this day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he mentioned the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a statement by a Republican party collaborator on CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and a tsunami kill hundreds, the balance is constantly rising
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them carried by huge waves that hit the beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celebs.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high flooded the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything on their way.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn’t flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a Jakarta prison conference.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone; it drove cars, pieces of wood, homes, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, stating that the tsunami had moved at 800 km/h offshore before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
The aerial images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies were found trapped under the debris of buildings in ruins, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building frantically screaming to passers-by that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to send aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuated people are still in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll has increased, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely and soundly in Palu, where they found shelter in shelters in the backyard of their offices, and discovered scenes of devastation along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to help the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday fell on Palu, relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried in the rubble for two days near her mother’s body.
The Indonesian national paragliding team coach, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an old man in the paragliding discipline, I experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
Her messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtly $26,750 when reloading an ATM
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent reloading an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Service.
The driver of the vehicle was living a distributor in the entertainment complex and was preparing to feed it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her arrival for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudonym, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
“I think “Ye” is the most used word in the Bible, where it means “you,” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
I passed from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, also played on the union line and the capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco’s square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly student allowances and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of education opportunities are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its research funding in this sector, according to investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors have made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are ahead of the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big AI discovery,” Lee says.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-rated American Othello player, then he joined the Microsoft Research management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that appropriates academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. efforts on AI.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Affairs Council unveiled its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians take part in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked the application for Macedonia's accession to the European Union.
Greece, one of its provinces called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto of entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was as follows: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, rescued from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of my country, for Macedonia’s youth, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of the registered voters at the end of the vote.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, the accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after filing his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43% of voters would want to participate in the referendum, which is lower than expected.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation to be 57%.
Seventy percent of those who wanted to vote said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero’s goal in the 65th minute seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He bypassed one defender before ousting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took advantage of it to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat Brighton's keeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who had given the Skyblues the initial lead in the Premier League game.
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the net just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble-party against the Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an elimination match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies took him 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game doesn’t matter, we want to be on the pitch in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the spot to Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day, Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is at 18-7 with an average of 2.53 points and 300 draws on catches in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that generated his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a big challenge. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group, Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to take back power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, evil and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public attention.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it used to be.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has been treated equally because she has stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are topics for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
That is exactly what the general assemblies of Friday night were during my eight years as a Labour Party MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It became clear that opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share the same political vision began to expect me to turn my coat around and take positions contrary to my convictions, whether it be about national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke in public, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive social media outcry, calling for a withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be a party member.
And it's not just my experience.
By the way, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a rift of sexist or racist speeches every day, but who do not let their arms down.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is confined to motions of distrust and changes to the selection rules.
I’ve been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lower my eyes, not express my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolteacher, because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I have been eager to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local government adviser or minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who voted for the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services, and I don't think this is really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains invincible
Two late attempts may have misrepresented the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match day of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now ranks at the top of the rankings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that have allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate on this match.
“So far, we’ve been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to think I’m happy!” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they have been more effective than us and have been able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to transform to make the numbers talk.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle. He scored and transformed a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury from Ruairidh Knott, who left the field on a civi<0xC3><0xA8>re. During the recovery, Ayr regained the lead with an attempt by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed rehearsal of Bruce Colvine, which created tangible tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the penalty touch, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's mulch, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the rehearsal, as almost every time since the rehearsal, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's kickbox and sent wingman Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home rehearsal.
The star of Still Game launches in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC’s famous show, which he writes and co-wrote with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the end of the show, and Kiernan appears to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowing restaurant environment."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in an armoured boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motto: “The sea is right back to us.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean, once again.
Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will vote in favour of the Bolivian request. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement on a sovereign transition to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will say in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even in the event of a positive decision.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the latest arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law, explains.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’s belligerent rhetoric undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also contested the fact that Morales – who remains to this day one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Only Happen When It Can Trust The U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it trusts Washington.
Ri said at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is “chimeric” to think that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will end the Korean War will make the North bend.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness over the renunciation of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is being debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal the Latest Headlining Trends, Maybe Soon Available in Your Stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delusional oversize hats at a PE19 parade that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
All the more extravagant hats each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to incorporate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's headpiece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the head of the models.
The other oversize accessories included jewellery-painted watermelons, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had lips sewn together and referred to Hannibal Lecter more than Haute-Couture.
One creation looked like a diving gear, with tuba and glasses, while another made it look like a melted ice cone.
And if you follow the fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the silhouette of the “Bomb”, the wide-bred straw hat that the stars take off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that flooded social media presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus parade at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the stores for next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and in their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build a trusting bond with people from other countries.
If we look at the excellent results of the exams this year, we find that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of the pupils obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of the pupils who studied German, 69% of the pupils who studied French and 63% of the pupils who studied English.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
From now on, languages as subjects are organized just like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the challenges employers face in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this sustainable skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That’s why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have better chances of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that at present, in a global commercial environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to LeBron James’ debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in a pre-season opening.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the vacancy confirmation vote in the Supreme Court being postponed, Trump is seeking to rally support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans win the ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the U.S. president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of a busy election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the meeting tonight, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try and relaunch him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope on Sunday's singles approach
After three singles, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could well represent what he was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The swing movement is an all-in-one sporting concept that players sincerely believe in, and more than ever at tournaments like this one.
So where would the momentum be now?
“They were leading with six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a bit of wings,” Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a little wind in the air and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of getting three points out of four each.
Spieth proved to be terribly effective from tee to green and gives the example.
Cries of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed, a crucial putt allowed him to equalize to the fourth part while Thomas and he were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match in the 15th hole, sparked a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in competition.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That’s all there is to each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four games and is not entitled to the mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to be circulating between them and the crowd, designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to cheer on a potential European victory as the sun sets on National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time with different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning's foreball hero, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniards and the Swedes into a hole they could never get out of.
No one is there to help you on Sunday.
Forks and foresoms are so fascinating to observe closely due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can turn in a blink of an eye.
Europe has played better in the team so far and made a considerable head start over the last day, but this foursome session also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's foreplays and foreplays.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points so far.
Well-decided to keep the title she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning fourballs, facing a disorganized American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in the furnaces and has won two victories, but they have failed to absorb the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the foreplay, they beat the pair composed of American novice Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who slipped during Saturday's two games, glittered a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in foresoms and foresoms, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning foreplay, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foreplay, winning the 2-1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, number one and number three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared in the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, under a fresh but free time.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had nothing more to do than to keep his trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a Sunday counterattack.
North Korea declares that disarmament cannot be “under any circumstances” unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions heightened his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that last year North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill,” such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear technology facilities, and not dismantling the nuclear test site, and making its commitment.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known accusations of Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” denuclearization approach under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, its statement found it to be important, as it agreed that it did not reject the idea.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made in Singapore on June 12 at the very first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work towards a “ensurement of security of the North Korean peninsula” while pro-Trump.
North Korea is trying to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and accentuates pressure by imposing sanctions to coercively achieve its goal, even opposing the “declaration of an end to war”.
“Those who think these sanctions can make us fall don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust.”
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: “If the party concerned with the denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States impasse, the denuclearization of the penitentiary does not exist.”
Still, Ri’s tone of speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after President Trump’s “evil” mission described Kim as “supposed.”
Trump, who threatened last year before the United Nations to “totally destroy” North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim applied measures to disarm, but added that there is still much to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted from the North.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council last Thursday that “the application of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until full, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Resting Classes <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing masculine tendency of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noticed that most of the students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, “Why do they only tell me that in the last year?”
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Dispensed for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s general director of health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what are the effects of smoking on health,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in “spending a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Having enough sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of innocence, making them sick.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that he be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all graduate students a similar degree program before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause dizziness.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team hoped to record their first away win since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team in the drift, eight points behind the Premier Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after throwing an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then took a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-mate defender Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have benefited from a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and him collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers enjoyed only two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly and a hit by Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening score in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs’ stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an end all in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted halfway by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the wing appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has nonetheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls over long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor managed well to push back Jacobs before Lithgow missed the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Sunday Morning Almanach: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOUR COMPTOR... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave birth to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man said, “What’s that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
With these headphones, we can really hear the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “So tell me, it’s sure to jump over there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears its name remains.
New Cancer Vaccine Allows the Immune System to ‘Discover’ Cancer Cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
In the course of treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of picking up immune cells to “learn” them to target cancer cells, has proven itself in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Hairy with a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after his transition to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West slammed himself on the shelf after a loose performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced he would run for office in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took over the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Sometimes I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He’s racist!’”
“Well, if racism worried me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was reported on social media by actor Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock was going to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with this cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a cage,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see him, the coffin?” and claimed that he would wear his superman cape because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try out the love.”
His comments attracted booze at least twice from the public and members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. A person on the spot told the magazine: “A death silence has fallen on the whole plateau.”
West had been called to replace at the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disillusioned many people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most courageous minds: THANK YOU TO HAVE HEAD TO THE FULL.”
But Karen Hunter, the show's host, tweeted that West was simply "faithful to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music, clothing, or supporting their art) who, in my opinion, adopts and dispels an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now “officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Accused of Attempted Murder After White-Weapon Assault in a Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The heads of prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the macho hero's stereotype, stating that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to pretend to be hard-boiled to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he said “something is wrong” and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of <0x23>MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, co-star of Game of Thrones, also aged 31, admitted that he was "strong" to address the issue.
“Personally, I deeply think we have harmed masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that is now emerging?”
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they have to behave in this way to be a man?
I believe this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There's obviously something that's ticking."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming that he ended up with "the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at the family estate of Leslie.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 per cent increase in its population with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been practically reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected people in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
A number of transmissions are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee has disclosed data about senators, denouncing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were backed by experts and "extremely right-wing" websites.
“Lies, lies, and infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information appears to have included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was released Thursday by a stranger at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press attaché.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not call into question the motives of the accused.
She has to stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said its office had alerted “the law enforcement authorities and services concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my team.”
Johnny English has hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, under-duty spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this remake of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with scalloped eyes and a rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicates first of all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-Anglophone cinema audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in The Fire Carts of London at the 2012 Opening Ceremony of the O Games.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard television commercials, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two pleasant moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades were hitting his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves with confidence with the comedy.
Humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and for me Johnny English’s far-flung misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent movie gags in Bean’s character.
The perennial premise of actuality is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the great disillusionment of the agents in service - a role unfortunately of small scale for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character at the edge of the crisis and already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to put under the scrub.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means you have to upset Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice tricks here, because English offers an espionage academy way Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-haired partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble at His Majesty's secret services, come back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of far-flung jokes: under the disguise of waiters, they set fire to a sparkling French restaurant; they create chaos by wandering on Volta's luxurious inner sailboat; and English triggers a real home virtuosity when he tries to steal the familiar, with a real helmet.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there’s not a lot of stuff for kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with all the other Johnny English films: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will truly value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having drawn up a plan for the British to be able to work four days but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to receive the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to enjoy economic change.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for workers and its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week of work is not a party policy and is not envisaged by it.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “anonymous administrators” and “beneficiaries” in utilities.
The Deputy Chancellor’s plans also foresee that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover all of their stakes since the Labour government could operate “deductions” due to alleged conduct differences.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of private company capital to employees, which will fund up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy trust “60 Minutes” if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote appears to be engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a very impressive chart of stars and invested in an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the festival, i.e. to end 20 years ago.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers must complete a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort in order to raise awareness of the population against the struggle.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really make it possible to persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clickivism” – a situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and contractors who are committed to “helping children develop their full potential”, while promising Rwanda a <0xC2><0xA3>35 million aid to end malnutrition in this country.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition program in London in a 2018 concert.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions aimed at asking the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children as part of nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, “what makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great civil rights movements and the struggle against apartheid ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. May Call on Navy to Create ‘Blockade’ to Block Russia’s Energy Exports - Interior Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” use the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East for the purpose of negotiating energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the center of southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
“The United States, with our Navy, can ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “spokesperson for energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia saying that Russia has “more than one string to its arc” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has pledged to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in September in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said “I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to provide their choice.”
The position of the United States has provoked negative reactions on the part of Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to get involved in the European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of running in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president in the wake of the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider coming forward.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider submitting my presidential candidacy.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “driving this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that she should be present in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe’s Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not come.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll revealed that former governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of Democrats who are highly regarded for a potential 2020 campaign are those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin discusses PTSD from Track Palin during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enrollment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is experiencing right now, what he feels coming home, I can connect him with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at the gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a taboo subject” and said about his son and other former fighters that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air force, and every other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Wasilla police, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and marital violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memo in favor of an asylum seeker who contested this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and marital violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined in accordance with the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” said amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the memo that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their home country due to persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in its June 11 announcement of the policy.
“The asylum has never been designed to mitigate all the problems — even the most serious — that people face every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center in the empty city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up devastated property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections on Nov. 6, a charge that China denies.
Accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press office, you will find few protest voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s disturbing economic trajectory, as the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating electricians to mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this matter have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, stated “we can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted "The month of November is coming!" in the Senate hallway as Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be disproportionate,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among suburban electors and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts have suggested that the reaction would be alive if Republicans pushed forward the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week that “it has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, it’s about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps Democrats.
Following Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, however, the Americans seem divided about the credibility of the two sides, with a small majority leaning on the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of people surveyed believed absolutely or probably Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, following pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of intoxication at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of the free platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as the persons authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was intended to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online store of personal data is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility through data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides the right resources, processes, and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team and he are not yet in discussions with “Facebook and Google” in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely camouflaged in an instant.
“We’re not asking them for permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that “[Inrupt’s] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War ecclesiastical decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St. Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", guided the line before jumping a field cannon on his own and assimilating three soldiers from the detachment.
On 4 October 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be part of the parade” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people.”
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a well-stocked Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main chip, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were seated when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were dissatisfied with staying awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the transition to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad joke."
Regarding the transmission, Bellator’s Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “Government regulations stipulate that at 6 a.m., this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s shows.”
""Peppa the pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would be working on their programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about redistribution, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more for the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that instilled the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before he went to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
As part of the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laurene, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to her illness.
Appearing as a wreck on Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The Olympic bronze double medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” back to others.
The triple world champion claimed that he "didn't wait" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married last year the Oscar-winning 20-year-old, but he said that age difference had never been a problem.
“When you live so many things at such a young age” – he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said confidently that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same highs and lows.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that “his whole perspective” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Daddy, you won’t be there to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he died so that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“That’s all I’ve dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, it inspired her first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - which had accompanied her during preparations for the Olympics and always gave her the chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the bench of the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to straighten out to avoid it being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who took part in the biennial competition for the twelfth time, a record, was smashed by captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's fore-and-foreclosures.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and skinning his game at the stand in order to remedy his ills.
At the age of 48, he was not the best fit for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough consistently punishes the wrong shots.
And as if the course was not scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, take a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two games.
I wasn't expecting more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we felt we should do it.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record for the largest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven more, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun measuring up to him this week, which was fun to see.
He’s doing more than playing.”
The captain of the European selection Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a not negligible advance ahead of the Ryder Cup’s last day can easily turn into a painful course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team with the captain Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, beating it 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>.
“You don’t stop remembering that we were leading broadly in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but fairness,” Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 for the National Men’s Golf 6 at the same time yesterday and Friday.
The story will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom tomorrow.
Go there and do everything you need to do.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have one goal, that is to try to win this trophy, and that is what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Enjoying the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never move forward on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and it goes quite differently.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re put to the test of your full capacity as a golfer.
That’s the message to pass on to the players, is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make sure his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last-day upheaval, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medina", where Europe took the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when going in one direction, weighs a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should, we try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said of his selections.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships dating from the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the admiral ship of the all-new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying issues that occurred after the delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and reduced acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years outside the ports of attachment.
According to Die Zeit, however, the relentless delays mean that avant-garde warships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in case of deployment on combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the “Rheinland-Pfalz” of 7,000 tons weighs twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the formation of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared with 2.2 billion initially.
Problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “short of ships capable of deploying”.
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were dismantled but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands is looking to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property in order to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will help to determine the frequency of cries of bats as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be drawn up to provide a detailed map of their territorial behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the perchors and result in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Mosquitoes are not really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight itinerary.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perchoir inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established Scotland's first and only reserve of bats at the Thrave site in Dumfries-et-Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Thrave, we have an ideal place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
It underlines the importance of checking the presence of bats before proceeding with the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying it unwittingly a single maternity nest, it can cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their umbrellas.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the head of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations at the moment.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “false information,” and said people “want to be known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, called this information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Golden Balloon winner told the camera.
“They want to get into publicity using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well,” the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have described as “inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the area of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where anal rape had occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "good guy" at "99%" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consented.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she subsequently accepted a settlement to the friendly because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "to undergo public humiliation."
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer, he joined the Italian giant Juve as part of a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of automakers.
According to Greg Clark, the secretary of state in charge of Commerce, the UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was “worrisome” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles – built nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
“I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced their fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tense flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The obvious, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent supply chain set.”
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be halted, it warned, however, that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union coordinator at the plant and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said its members were increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The White House says Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be delayed
According to the announcement made by the White House on Sunday, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “repelled by a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump and Russia’s collaborators, and possible obstacles to justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will return the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
On Monday, however, he appeared in the White House as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not to” dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into complaints made against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we postpone one more week given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The statement would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the lectures was not due to an aversion for "demagogic" television reporters, although she said: "I have nothing against the fact that they're tearing up the gallery."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on their own.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and sometimes a bizarre appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
About Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, withdrawal negotiations have continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second-in-command, was operated on urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27 defeat.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before halftime.
“It arrived on the touchline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a stool and taking it for another examination.
A representative from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there was “no details yet on the type or extent of the injury” and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his move from Illinois.
He had five touchdowns in total on Saturday before leaving the match, bringing his total of the season to 18 touchdowns.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will be used to strengthen the government’s efforts in the struggle to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which adds to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels established two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13% of London’s new constructions are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which makes prices rise and prevents first-timers from making a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who reside most of the time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp rights to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using them, he invited Ms. May to waive the quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the “property disgrace” that is raging in the United Kingdom.
Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the abolition of “faultless” evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I stated that I would dedicate my position as prime minister to the revival of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK as it is for foreign companies to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For far too many people, the dream of accessing property has become distant and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is pleased to take on the challenge of bringing the Northeastern club back to life, which currently occupies the third place in League 1 with three points from the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s Hampden games with my father and it’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only arise if I succeeded in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland breeders are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he has not hesitated to rank behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
By the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I managed to get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts coaching.
He then helped Alloa rise from a relegation into the third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa’s handling “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, that I made a good living and that I enjoyed some appreciable peaks.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle each week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer cannibalism has raised the revenues of British pubs in difficulty, but has heightened the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that groups of bars and pubs recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the data, said: “England’s longer-than-expected sunshine and participation in the World Cup made July follow the model of June, where bars still had a significant increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants.
The 1.8% decline in the catering sector in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of similarity than the restaurants that come down.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out and get a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased 6.6 per cent over the month and food declined by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a drop in sales of 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long, warm weather could not have been less appropriate for food industry operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a well-deserved rest.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in deployment.

On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “primary” account to show to their parents
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – open a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
20% of students said they managed a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while also having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to a study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds have a double profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his vast experience gained internationally over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that athleticism in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m at the Olympic Games in Atlanta where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after undergoing a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how far.
It was a stressful job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
Online, an advertisement on the milkshaker that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement of a company offering a milkshake compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is termed the “world’s first silent milksucker,” Elvie, a public technology company, launched a bold ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milksucker offers breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I give myself up, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t notice it, it’s my breasts, not breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women cheating on the milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “horror.”
“A bad decision than using cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who are keeping their baby?”
Someone else added, “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others advocated advertising, such as a woman admitting she found the song “hilarious.”
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented, “It’s a fun advertisement for moms who pull their milk (often at their workplace or toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal to have danced with the discreet suckers hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk puller say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breastfeeder is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly inserts into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie milkshaker is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk puller will provide.
This isn't the first time that the sniper Elvie makes one of the newspapers.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled in silence in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies that have made it difficult for children to be placed in respondents’ homes.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves immigrants without papers and were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by rescuing a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons did not have a legal history.
“Nearly 80% of people who are respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with the children's case, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court in the month after their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case in relation to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed to be ineligible will be promptly expelled.
According to speakers and reports submitted in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
In a large institution such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have difficulty coping with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw on the ground.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011 and millions more being de-rooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “lead this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and from any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-ravaged country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said the conditions were favourable for the refugees to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that discourage refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have made it known that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is concluded.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold in Idlib has allowed political negotiations to move forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided “precise deadlines” and expressed the hope that military measures would target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. representative, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “the revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and formulated a warning against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the ouster and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
That would probably be “the most spectacular finale of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings at peak hours have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and almost tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the hour of great listening, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at the big evenings, is the first cable channel.
“It’s a matter that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” commented Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor, who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy author and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And Some Undeniable Truths About Sliding into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him. . .
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike everything that happens on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen of Washington when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward has used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on the "Fear" of Daniel's quilted quilted quilts, and "Storment" of Paul Manafort's $15,000 quilted quilt.
I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
“If part of what he does makes it feel like watching a reality TV show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the changing teams and daily situation returns.
You can't afford to miss an episode if you're in the backseat.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at his home on the north bank of Kauai, but he was lying inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were animating all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a redesign of congressional constituencies that allowed two holders to contest the same seat.
This Pittsburgh suburban district, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special election last spring.
Lamb is measuring up to another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district sparked a confrontation over the financing of the electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a just-won victory last March in a very popular special election in the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had little opposition to.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only envisaged against Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide development and economic support to it.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference that had the theme of security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year to the United States, perceived as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent them.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now listening to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying the History
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now backed by substantial evidence.
Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of a connivance of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If congressional control changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself in a position to be held accountable to this body, as he prepares to stand before voters and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many “ifs” there, and I do not claim that Mr Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had led him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these rifts and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these rifts.
What do we do if Mr. Trump sends the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly registering the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the investigation recently asked the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial — or if it is entrusted to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimonies?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With this heritage in place, I cannot be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident in front of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following an impressive match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first participation of the season until a 2:2 null match against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to achieve feats.
“It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We got into the game thinking of getting something and we left with a point.
We might have won it in the end, but overall, a zero match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a tough game because they did a good result in their last match, yet I’m sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there’s a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is of quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind and triumph.”
Women no longer find sleep due to fears about their retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be looked after, few people raised the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they’re not doing what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you figure out how to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buy-in value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses, or another insurance on your property – provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the passage.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you are hit with incapacity.
Think about the little details: Let’s say your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”
A man was wounded several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed air rifle as he returned on foot from an evening.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 p.m. BST, as a “random act”.
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries do not threaten his life and the police have launched a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the balance sheet is expected to rise.
As communications were paralyzed, the emergency services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and especially of the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been questioned on suspicion of marital violence, violating a report of marital violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement published Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he allegedly picked up the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in provisional detention in the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Centre and is held under unsecured security of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, it’s safe” when his plea was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, meaning he could be sentenced to up to a year’s imprisonment and is liable to a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor Class B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with marital violence, interference in the report of a crime of marital violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner claimed that he had stabbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after making the link between her son’s violent behavior and PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time of the tsunami on the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for person suspected of terrorist attack in New York
New York’s federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people — a rare punishment that hasn’t been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, smuggling pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after this assault, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 indictments, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and vehicle destruction.
The attack required “a careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “odious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian d'Dénucco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The southern district of New York has not demanded the death penalty as part of a 10-year lawsuit.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for committing conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he had been incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to pursue.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept his plea of guilt and to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the People’s Army” at a rally at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be charged with negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would have “already been liberated” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma that May faces to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been underlined by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its program and “chaos.”
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted “to get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already come out,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We have not surrendered to world wars to submit to us.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, and this is also the case of our party and our activists who are marching the streets and making us elect above all else.
Leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honour their promises.”
“Mr. Farage told the gathering that politicians should be brought to ‘feel the pressure’ if they were about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to fool Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We won’t let you get out of it like that.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing this country’s popular army that has allowed us to win Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
His working-class counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of security concerns about the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running in the presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future on Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that “the time had come for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state.”
Arrested at the death of Sims at Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death of basketball player Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they had posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who was featured on the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning, near the campus of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, holding a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed on guard duty at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Service.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of them as starting last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads to the world title after the team's directives allowed him to win the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and swept Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to jump into the peloton’s tail turmoil, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands one lane later and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-on action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the interior at risk of resisting after a double-defense attempt in the third lane.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speeding finish and outperform Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally reached the stands in the 44th lap, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight lap, Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were “bad, disgusting and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening these last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When they see the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t disclose any information,” he added, thinking about the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’ll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all means.
You see the evil, the messy, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by scoring a 5-3 return game at Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, ensuring their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, with the Giants triumphing in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
In a very busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team came together and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, ensuring his team’s victory by scoring a fifth goal in the midfield.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
An Air Traffic Controller Died Helping Hundreds of People Aboard an Airplane to Escape the Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to devastate the region and a large number of people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his position in the violently shaken tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn that,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country’s disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance sheet would continue to rise as many bodies were still under debris and a large number could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and foodstuffs.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man has disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man was missing after the 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the flying plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats took part in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the rescue exits of the plane were sinking.
He claimed that the officers on board had panicked and shouted, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working nearby to improve a dock had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The indictment postponed his case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records from a cell phone to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis e met Chambers the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' home when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to speak.
Sanford showed up at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he " lied, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense must begin its advocacy on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop politics?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impregnating their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make hip hop politically popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a “racist” text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistaken message from her mother complaining that she was “another Black.”
The couple denies being racist, and assimilates the prosecution to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay by noting in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCOURAGES A NORTH,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her "uncomfortable" stance, Plasco-Flaxman sent Ms. Maurice back, explaining that their old nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was rather waiting for a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple in order to obtain compensation for her dismissal and claims a daily compensation of $350 for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, fearing he could not trust him after he did him wrong.
“My wife had sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you pursue someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It’s very funny, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after her recent death.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn’t a pretender,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds: we are proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although this is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save his life.
“Nad regularly called in to explain how bad the situation was, and we didn’t expect it to go away,” commented Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly depleting and coming out of his system.
She had died a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
“No one was aware,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted on a Welsh bridge postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don’t keep quiet – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt shot down, depressed or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything.”
She said her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they have to get away with it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for — a time-limited, scope-limited investigation — we might be able to bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters “fall” under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee by China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that remained pending until then.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and claims he is incapacitated to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would have treated her as “hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost suffocated and suffocated by mentioning his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations regarding him a “grosque and coordinated assassination” organized by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed he was incapacitated to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed he was against Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he dealt with Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only incapacitated to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also incapacitated to sit in the court where he is currently,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi further added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh evaded the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It’s a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflow, and it can’t get her out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m sorry.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I found myself one day crying with an inexpressible rage, was that I had been caught by the skin of my neck by an old woman who had been in a cold direction who had always terrified me.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a maturely thoughtful decision,” she told me laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and the last thing they lacked was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in fundraising, and thus vowed not to participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually donated $1,000 to men expected to give her only $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions – the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and the targeting of voters – that she felt that she was sexist rather than delegates.
“You would have thought I was depressed,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder of the press’s reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase this week came with new customs duties affecting items worth 200 billion US dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China that arrive in the United States.
Each time, Beijing reacted in nature, hitting tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on 60 billion U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equalize the United States, and it’s unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will slumber soon.
To have Washington back down is to give in to the demands, but to publicly give in to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role correctly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one or another country is actually far more dangerous than what observers have previously recognized,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New Security.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria stands ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the bar of the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during most of the tournament, plunged his starting shot into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, surrendering his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 to 4 by the European team's lowest-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, tilted 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to tilt.
We’ve gotten over it.”
Red tide info point: Lower concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tidal concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which is feared by declining concentrations.
The red tide covers approximately 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are islands about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or outside Pinellas County have been reported last week, low to high concentrations outside Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or overseas, wide to high concentrations in Collotte County, and low concentrations at low concentrations.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
