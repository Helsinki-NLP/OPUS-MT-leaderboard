28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at a local mall’s rampage this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and notes: “His business was finally going well.”
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall shopping mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco scholar Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Death Investigation Agency.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was a felony and an investigation is underway.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line cook in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a line cook at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "horrified and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that acts like a close family, and he will be greatly missed," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed in the early hostels, but that recently "his business was finally going well".
"He found an apartment and met a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, make dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who was driving with the current.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a diamond that shined brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone with any information on the matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Demands for new labour-fighting measures
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade unions to adopt new labour-fighting measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is calling on the entire Council to support new labour-fighting measures starting in early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Doctoral practitioners and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement, which had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters voted against it.
In a letter to members of the JDC, JDC President Ellen McCourt said Thursday night that the government had remained "stagely silent" on issues that she said led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiations on all of your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC government has today formally submitted a request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to obtain authorization for the progressive and expanding work-fighting programme beginning in early September.
The controversy has resulted in medical practitioners participating in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
BMA’s Chief Medical Practitioner, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after a vote rejected the terms recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical practitioners and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would be prescribed for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
The one that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands with each other and declare an official end to the eight-month-long battle for words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, it was on the occasion.
But Putin’s smile seemed populous, and he barely threatened the heat, even by his own restrained norms.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly referred to Putin as his “loving friend” — five times, according to a report.
I messed up the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but even better.
The following day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his passion is the opposite.
But Putin’s radiance showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was outrageous.
Putin attacked Ankara, accusing it of shoving Moscow on its back.
The injury was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Reconstructing real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russia’s public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-run media led to an astonishing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
One of the most serious accusations was the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the ISIS-ruled Syrian territories.
He has strongly denied this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin had to apologise to President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of making an agreement for a harsh regiment are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was nearly ousted from power in last month’s failed coup d’état.
Continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially a ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The amount has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights finally continue.
They're hoping for a late-season break in the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", as formulated in the report of the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the Western countries for what is seen as a weak response to the attempted coup d'etat.
Adding to the long-running turmoil of the EU accession negotiations, Putin, who is keen to exploit the cold and to break Turkey’s ties with the West, emerges.
The Russian leader certainly got discharge points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary effort to support the appointed authorities.
This, of course, is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a coup d’etat.
So this meeting at the beautiful seaside palace enabled the "external confederation" presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel that the Western countries have abandoned them and treated them wrongly, joining their forces.
However, despite the public conciliation process, the two have major disagreements.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed to play the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.
It can be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question regarding their disagreements, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on what they can look for a common basis with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostilities, and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better for the two leaders to be back even in the interim.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand adhered to the Bank’s international goals.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has given up on these goals.
The Bank’s strategies have been using the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in operation with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references other than head office and stock exchange listings will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed on a customer and staff tour in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS will become the employer of our investors and employees, as we will now become a much more branded bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorships.
“It’s time for us to move in the direction of brand banking, because basically (we’ve been asked) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not ours, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000
The detector showers champagne after a double win with a total of 3,000 wins
Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the pinnacle of the evening with his second win on his home track in competition with John Gosden's Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edder and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion hockey detector, who had previously won the Ghayari, said, "This is special."
I am very emotional because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big event, this is not a Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The detective succumbs to the hoaxes when he succumbs to the Predilection after the victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in obstacle races – champion hockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record-breaking career of over 4,300 victories.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the present era, and it’s no surprise that she has reached this milestone that few have reached before her.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical genius distinguishes him from the rest of the weight room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his passion and charisma have attracted fans of the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he'd ride 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big race jockey!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British competition, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the landing of the saddle with a flywheel formed into a milestone brand.
From aeronautical stoppages to aeronautical landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a mountain range.
Winning at major races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, he also survived a plane crash and suffered from a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had a hard start when he returned after six months of banning competition, but he showed considerable temperament when challenging the suspects and returning in his best condition.
And he may go on for a long time - the detective has previously said that he would like to continue competing at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin to Resign Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has abruptly fired Sergei Ivanov, the head of the regiment.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin’s statement said that Putin had “ordered Ivanov to step down from the post of head of the Russian presidential administration,” but there was no reason for this.
Since 2012, Ivanov’s deputy director, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later led the president’s protocol and government staff, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in the drafting of laws and in the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his place and recommended that Vaino be appointed in his place.
Are Smiles Convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, served as the Soviet security service in the KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a state television meeting with President Putin, the two men claimed that the chief of staff had withdrawn at his own request.
But despite the smiling cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate, suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy, has been received with real suspicion.
In his comments on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said to Putin: "It is true that in early 2012, I asked you in the debate to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, if I may even say work, task.
“I’ve been in charge for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the state security service in the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, because Putin’s third term would have been against the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
'Criminal Minds' star Thomas Gibson gets his shoes after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
The series' producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced their separation in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner apologised on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI storytelling series are expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it everything for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there to the end, but it is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans that the show can have.
The start of the twelfth production season of the series is scheduled for 28 September.
Mysterious fish end up in a garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be wind fins that the water cycle has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published footage of the apparition at Periscope in the hope that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing: Bridge now extends to Fifee
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined the northern cover of the Queensferry crossing and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four lattices between the "covering lattices" that are now being prepared around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 dams.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the coil between the ground bridge and the bridge bridge is a demanding operation, where extremely precise measurements must be matched.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge bridge is now in place and the last part of the deck is being poured into the concrete deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the pinnacle of building technology.
When the last section of the roadway was installed and connected to the expanding north pole roadway, we had to close the remaining section on the northern side, i.e. the inland side.
This was done by pulling the ground bridge of the north lane 700 mm southwards.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
It is huge, because it is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was to be pulled about 3% at an angle of inclination.
Complicating, because the permitted measurement deviations according to which the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in either direction.
Thankfully, however, everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky alive"
The three men are "lucky alive" after they fell off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station made an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event unfolding on Moelfre Bay.
The three men were desperately trying to swim in safety as their boat continued on its own.
“We saw the boat rotating closer to the men and imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, a plumber on the Moelfr rescue boat.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got on the move," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found hanging from a boy without lifeboats.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “These three men who have been in the water are lucky to be alive and completely intact.
The boat's engine had a kill rope, but it had somehow separated from the person who was driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather that they prefer to spend their free time watching the shows.
Pokémon Go allows people to get up from the couch and participate in some activity.
The screening time was initially limited to television, then to video games, and now recently to smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to the wildling called Pokémon Go. app, which is based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they were created cartoons, game cards and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Subsequently, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as a huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS, and which can be "photographed" (by using the phone's screenshot) or "catch".
The generation that played the game as a youngster has joined the wild and jumped up from the couch in search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the "average person" daily steps.
Apple Watch’s Cardiogram app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent in Cardiogram-followed users.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training level information.
The appeals of many public health campaigns to “find 30,” “noise from the couch,” and “be active every day” have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look like accidents.
However, the importance of the movement cannot be diminished.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people to go out and do something they enjoy.
This will cover the three pillars of health: exercise, cool air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even get in the hunt for new friends.
As usual, disgusting cheerleaders are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk to the door.
And then what?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there used to be apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn’t give reason to move in the same way that this game did.
The novelty charm disappears and the use dissolves in time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity helping many hunting people to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to this.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth with pumpkins.
Unbelievable permanence.
Wonderful everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multisport championship on Thursday, highlighting the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic torchlight.
His overall score, 62,198, was clearly better than silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
U.S.-based Simone Biles will compete in the Women’s Cross-Ball Championships final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the championship in multiples, and the fifth American champion in all, while at the same time cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment was over.
This achievement brings him to the same category as the other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken his species to a new level:
Biles has managed his races for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so astonishing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best I see as a gymnast".
The final test awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between his and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning to the family home in the Texas Springs without the choral gold medals would have been a disappointment.
U.S. Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) at the women’s racket multiplayer final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, elok.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he peaked at the starting party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karolyin.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of the future as he goes a long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which includes the volt-building of his brand - has been adapted to Latin American music, which also fits well on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a babysitter by her grandparents, and found by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother while she was on a study trip in the hall where Boorman was trained, has become a powerhouse.
He has not lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in the small lead after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The balance tree and permanence, where Biles is the dominant world champion, were waiting.
He rose to the top with 15,433 points and surpassed them by 15,933 permanence.
Raisman hugged her benevolently as they waited for the endpoints – mere formality – and the tears rose to Biles’s glitter-red, white, and blue eyes when the dream of which he once wrote his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in third place but lost to the bronze in the rematch.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "grandmother," was clearly in charge.
He sent airstrips to the public after his permanent performance on emotionally charged return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet from this week gets a whole new meaning:
Police: Three Victims of Mass Murder Shot While Listening to Music in Car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in the deadliest attack in Phoenix’s first serial killer case in the past decade, sitting in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement published on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot dead in a car parked on June 12.
According to the report, the gunman standing on the passenger side of the car fired his hand up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death does not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not carry handbags or $2,900 from another adult victim.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Major-General Jonathan Howard, said the shooting led investigators to see if it was related to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have been killed and two injured in the nine attacks that took place over the course of four months in two major Latin American districts.
“This is happening in the residential area in front of the house,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators have not agreed to reveal the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triple murder and was targeted by an empty open-plan car, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found shells of bullets, bullets in the seat, and bullet fragments in the engine room.
6-year-old mother with microcephaly: "The situation will be easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a minor, a consequence of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
“When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise that.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never have learned to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed under inpatient care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a stroller.
Edmund didn’t sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn’t talk.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how Edmund's inventive clues refer to "did you sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own sign language.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different reasons: genetics, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as asthma or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden caused by an uncertain future.
I'm just asking what's gonna happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I have not asked for a prediction from time to time, because I do not expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's gonna be easier.
You can believe the situation is getting easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rains and floods triggered rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their creeks and caused widespread flooding due to extreme rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are in constant contact with the local authorities and that aid is already coming to the counties in need.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor’s Office for Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they were receiving requests for upstream vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipaho County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that the area is expected to receive three to five centimeters more rain.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in place on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and were forecast to set a flooding peak over the weekend.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding in the lower district of Ascension, located along the river, as flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi State border, the Tickfaw River in Lousiana, Liverpool, was at the highest level ever on Friday morning at 9:00 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking up people from flooding in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were close to Gloster on Friday.
The 62-year-old says that normally over 400 feet from his house, Beaver Creek’s water rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another close friend of the boy warned him.
“We woke up, and the water just kept rising,” Hansford said.
It extended all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she hadn’t seen the shallow water so high during the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have injuries, and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the three in a large, army-style truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station, where the survivors stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods are "spreading rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says a witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said the country had been completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of residents of Tangipahoa district from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the city council in Tangipaho said 200 homes had been flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under a flood.
The county’s president, Robby Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been left stranded by rising water.
Amite and Hammond cities have been opened to shelters for those who have been evacuated.
“They get to go home when the water starts to drop,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, in Tangipaho County, twenty streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and moves.
“The last major flood here was in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Management Officer Rupert Lacy said the steady rain continued on the Gulf coast of Mexico.
He said a handful of houses were reported flooding on Thursday, but no floods have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, "Full of bullets" to survive Philadelphia bombing
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, meaning another six-year-old was shot in the city this week.
The child’s grandparents told CBS Philadelphia he was named Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown had several gunshot wounds to his wrists, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was aware when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," grandma Delores Melendez told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first grade at a local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One 29-year-old man was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot from the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in a critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a gunman.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a cross between several gunmen.
The type of shells in the attack tank, which originated from different attack tanks, filled the site.
It seems that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were a number of armed fighters here and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, the police are investigating the tapes of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, got a false hit in her hand on Tuesday as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
So I'm calling this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, after all, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the peak of the species.
The most successful female rapist in the last four years has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American woman to win individual gold in a row in women’s multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got the silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the “Final Five” (the last five) because there will only be four gymnasts in the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karolyi’s final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive type, and gymnasts usually practice in private gyms maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for gymnasts and their gymnasts) and for their families.
A large part of these gymnasiums are located in affluent suburban suburban areas that can support species.
With these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities where many young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have offered free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latino) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (home city) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
Strengtheners develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the effort, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team's inspiration gets thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it's amazing.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious “girlpower” by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical Practitioners Organize New Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
Ministers had wished to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with officials of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 practitioners who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to coerce the deal, saying that the NHS was “on unknown ground” and that even small additional delays harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to the night and weekend work methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Committee of Medical Practitioners, said in a statement last night: "Medical practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially the fact that it accelerates the existing labor crisis."
When the time before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract is only eight weeks left, progress must be made and the time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government’s unwillingness to participate and occasional deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, abolish the sanction and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not, the medical practitioners are ready to continue the labor struggle.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a delay of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 receptionists, when nurses and consulted doctors were recruited to act as replacements for doctors on strike.
The ministers had wished to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend salary with 54,000 medical practitioners under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers Association, appealed to medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Working battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that are already in a challenging situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of the Guardian and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that there would be a continuous positive discussion of other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those who return from work, costs of education, reciprocal recognition of the educational programme, as well as a mutual recognition of the educational programme, as well as a gender pay gap.
Two pounds a day drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a drug that costs <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day after authorities have recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrence in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another stroke.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack each year in England, and a quarter of them have a second stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the fatty substance that accumulates on the wall of the artery, which forms an arrhythmia.
If the clot breaks, it can cause blood clotting, which prevents blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks down, it can pass with the blood and interrupt the blood circulation to the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already received one scene have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
In today’s NICE guideline, it is recommended that people receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective treatments to prevent progression, up to a quarter of people with a heart attack will later have a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often painful.”
The fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly with regard to the risk of bleeding, for periods of more than three years, the draft guidance is not recommended for treatment for longer than this period.
The Culture of Political Correctness Allows the Emergence of Electoral Waves in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has accused police, election officials and city officials of ignoring evidence of electoral fraud due to "race and religion-related hypersensitivity".
The former Community Secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to place chains of guards outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present their identity card when voting in order to prove who they are.
Today, the only thing that a voter needs to say is his name and address.
The report even proposes that an indelible ink should be placed on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
“Informants should be better protected,” Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have greater access to the Board's documents and decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
“This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets voting scandal.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court said Rahman had "cyly distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critic's accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were guessing or the result of a person voting for the performance as something else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern in a polling station where members of the high-ranking Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, pictured, made a number of recommendations on the cleanup of the voting system, including proof of identity with a ID
He said: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in those communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There was concern that ... the institutions of the state had disregarded such behavior 'politically correct' due to racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists from handling postal ballots in order to end the 'collection of votes'.
The report, which Theresa May is considering, also calls for stricter checks on registrations to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Check the options for attesting the identity of the voters before voting.
Use indelible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-to-email votes and envelopes where votes are sent.
Let the police put guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Requires that only English (except in Wales) is used at polling stations.
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the polling station alone.
Sir Eric protests the Greater London police force saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Supreme Court will remain as a result of the numerous acts of corruption and illegal activity of Lutfur Rahman and his officials,” he said.
On the basis of numerous grounds, he was found guilty without a doubt, according to criminal evidence.
He also criticized ineffective "soon checks" at the polling stations of the city councils.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a splendid legacy as the birthplace of parliaments, but this disturbing and mysterious spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Mad about Kate’s bicyclist double solo and other celebrity photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the Duke of Cambridge’s impressive double-seater.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his famous double flight - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio races and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the American men’s archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s twin creature found on the bike lane, many people online have been quick to notice how a certain archer could be a star with Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his photos surfaced, in which he looks terrifyingly similar to The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, when he became aware of the excitement of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard since childhood that he looked like Leo.
“I don’t see much uniformity myself, except maybe with regards to the barber,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a nice-looking guy, so I guess this is courtesy."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely come out this year as well: the astonishing uniformity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafin's big, eye-catching look is said to be the twin soul of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger shift to the eye: According to this user, Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have similarly strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimovala has more of the same actress as Annalynne McCord than brown skin and light hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's sporting version".
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presenting the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter’s actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile is exactly the Bring It On star of Gabrielle Union's smile.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s 4x200-meter women’s free throw message angered viewers of CBC’s live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has had to apologise after one of its reporters said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese feminist “lost like a bad smell” and “died like a pig.”
Spokesperson Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200m freestyle messaging final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC storytelling team to bring in the "color" was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China was barking, baby.
Too excited, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the message in the second half at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, giving Canada a chance to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on live broadcast."
China’s Ai Yanhania was portrayed in the women’s 4 x 200 metres press finale as follows: “The little 14-year-old from China slammed you, baby.”
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heroic and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who ran the CBC broadcast, apologised for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We're sorry that the comment on the swimming performance had to be broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.”
The CBC apologised more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
The rapporteur, Scott Russell, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and apologised to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The television company also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
We quickly took action last night and apologised to our viewers and followers on social media in a live stream.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised in a live broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologise at this moment for the comment I made yesterday after the women's message," he said in a CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not as a person."
"It may seem unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it disrespectful and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was shocked by a woman who lavishly arranged for underwear in the middle of a trade
Customers didn’t know what to look for when the woman took off in the middle of the Primark movement to try out the panties.
Things were not improved by the fact that after assessing what he looked like in his pants, the woman shelled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually arranged for four pairs of underwear in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark’s business at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman fitted underpants and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother of two children in the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after experimenting with underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the shop without buying anything".
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took on the pair’s underwear, took off her own socks and underwear, and put on her adjustable legs.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to reconcile, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everyone was staring as he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more pairs before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching - or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear that he matched."
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident of Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t cleaned.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I noticed that the staff apparently tried to remove the pieces of clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is quite good."
“It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and notice that another woman has put them on and stripped them off, and they haven’t been washed.”
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Krav Maga Federation Mayor Rhon Mizrach in New York City to find out how to deal with swaying predators in close proximity.
Whether you’re approached in front or behind, this video shows you how you can pay the attacker with the same coin.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you first have to turn to see your attacker and "repel the line of fire".
You then grab the gun between your elbow and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting the knee to the wrists, and when the attacker goes from pain to scarring, turn the gun from his hands, hit him with the gun behind his face and back with the gun pointing at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the fire line, grab a gun, and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to fire.
At the same time put weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun from his grasp, back and point him with the gun.
Sounds like trouble?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's grandmaster, the safest way out of a robbery is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's Dirtiest Places for a Travel Guide
A British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe’s dirtyest and most sleepy places.
Suffolk-born storyteller and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, released a euro banknote, a tape at the Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet rinse button, and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before downloading each item, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was facing.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of lowering the rinse button on the train used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Wright was constantly talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, none of his licks left anything but a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as a test of the endurance of his gut as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task from the railings of public railway stations to the rinse button of the toilet seat really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said, “Since I was a child, I’ve been pretty careless about my health, and I’ve put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, worms and fresh water.”
He really did confirm his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of over 4,000 units in a photometer.
For comparison, the reading of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in one of the Russian public visits, he did not agree to give up, when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler’s film, The Trace of the Inner Power, together with a Finnish dairyman, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing so dirty!
I'm not gonna lick anything because there's nightclubs here.
The traces of internal strength were produced together with a Finnish dairy farmer, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefil, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help boost human gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s head of snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time would explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up thinking, 'Let's play Ian.'"
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Increasing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Director Tom Hakala added: “Let’s just say it like this: If Ian had kissed some of the things I asked him to do, such as the nightingale Russian in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the arrowing things were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks recorded."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84% of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria specifically for the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said they use products with lactic acid bacteria added at least occasionally.
Family Destroyed Rental House in Cornwall, Saltash, Before Marriage
The <0xC3><0x96>ykkäri family suffered <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages to their rented house after they were deported because of terrorism by neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Cornwall, Saltash, after being sued several times.
When they had been forcibly removed from the property, shocked employees of the housing company found the property in poor condition.
The walls had been made of firing holes, the floor slabs were torn, the waste had been poured onto the floor and the walls had been carved with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private housing.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall’s less comfortable groups.
This family is concerned, and their names are concerned."
The couple had three sons who lived on the property in between, and according to police, the family’s intimidation included street fighting on the beach, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and casual shouting, quarreling and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease, was given a decision on unsocial behaviour.
In many of the rooms of the house under the dismantling rail, old waste was found.
The property, from which drugs have previously been transmitted, floor coverings had been scraped up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street and that police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly married a woman and her partner’s property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily change the time.
The eased neighbours thanked the marriage, saying that their lives had become as hell.
Someone said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived with their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here unbelievably many times.
“This morning we didn’t have a dream.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were called to the property often
Waste and old toys have been thrown down on the wall of the rental house.
He added: “It is unfortunate that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own and his or her family’s behavior, as marriage is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions certainly appalled the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, by the Devon and Cornwall police, and by the brave members of the community who gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived on the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
Dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after rejuvenation
The employees of the housing company now have to clean the waste floors surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as weight, supplies and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after admitting his guilt in possession of a Class B drug with the intention of distributing it onwards.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners are living homeless after now freezing into private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.
Police say they are trying to marry residents who mock the rules of their rental agreement.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the marriage was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behavior is sanctioned, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and they will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.

The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
It was at this very moment that the terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying shower machine swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows how the military plane came close to contacting the sun worshippers on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they began to be understandably concerned about the method of the shower machine, even though they did not at first see what was behind the clouds coming towards them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was falling to the ground.”
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew at an incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by nearby fires, but the air force assured that no one's safety was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, in addition to the deaths of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot had to fly in low visibility due to the conditions, the smoke caused by the field fires and the thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Outcome of exotics in the first half of the year better than expected
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) achieved a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned in January-June.
The result of the exots was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The guarantee of care was carried out in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the lines of action.
The exote covers the surplus of the previously created deficit.
The remaining portion may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is projected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exotic Government will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guardsmen Sworn to Military Sworn in Immol
Seventy of the guards at the Border and Sea Guard School swore an oath on Friday.
The military parade of the guards of the Border and Marine Corps School was held in Immol on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Crossing Course was held at the team’s sports field.
The military took an oath of 70 men.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border guards.
250 of them were invited to the polls.
Specialist border guards have been trained in Immol since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the veterans' meeting held in connection with the statehood.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
Draw some rubbish above - criminal investigation helps to find out crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police stations has been operated by an RTA, or Criminal Investigation and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In Häme’s police station, the unit includes a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a lieutenant colonel in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Commander Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civil suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations for the other police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the most recent working methods
The establishment of analysis units is a reform of the most recent police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. that the police would not leave the cellphones until the alarm is received.
The information gathered and analysed by the unit is used to target daily police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal investigation centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a separate criminal investigation unit for each police agency.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Crime Police, is leading the operation nationally.
In the PTR units, according to its name, people work from the Police, Customs and Border Patrol.
The RTA units, in turn, operate in areas divided according to police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both the local police force and the national units.
Inquiry extends beyond your own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police station area.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of your institution, because that is what criminality does.
Workers in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police officers.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminal or reminiscent crimes with the help of registers, alarm databases and observations.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal investigation.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
A handprint can also be seen at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the method of making, the author is made up of a certain kind of image.
The serialization can be done either on the basis of the method or the person depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city collars upright, but their work is not fully public.
There is no mention of both the methods used by criminals, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention efforts.
The police will tell you about the methods publicly if it predicts that they pose a threat.
Such a case, for example, was reported from the beginning of the summer, used in housing burglaries as a way of marking empty apartments.
In it, the makers set up an outside door stick, a button needle, or a piece of tape with which they tested whether the residents were really traveling.
Submissions shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The Analytical Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
For example, the nokleys order a district court protocol, which can show that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, the thieves will wear gloves in their hands.
The case was interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppää of Häme Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola of the Police of Eastern Finland, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve of Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela of the Central Criminal Police.
The police collects and analyzes information that helps to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside of your institution and the borders of Finland.
A schoolgirl from London who was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian speech in Raqqa, which is the headquarters of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just while planning his escape from the rubble of the war and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a gravestone and as a testament to others, that leaving the war zone involves real risks - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East German schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid Says Clinton Considers Garland as Supreme Court Candidate If Elected
Senate Democratic President Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected to the presidency.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland’s confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect the person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia.
Reid said in a phone call on Thursday that he is predicting "what degree of certainty" that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would name Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not want to “shock the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland’s nomination are “hands-on” and “potentiators” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of nude celebrities, they plan to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, which contains a lot of nude pictures, is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them, too.
"We need to start presenting a timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these nude pictures of women," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave photos online or in person at selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The purpose of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you venture to fill out the comment section with irritated insults, whose author is labeled NoAllLonelyMiddle-Age Men, notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much talked about new release of the albums is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the medium-age spark.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased vinyl plates are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely of all records to buy belong to the age group of 18-24 years old.
It’s also not just a matter of collecting hobbyists, but it also includes a label: older vinyl buyers are a bit more likely to like their feelings inside (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solo (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would quiver vigorously before stopping, form a cup of my hands and say something powerful, like, "Let's look into it."
Let's look at it more closely.
At the same time that Soho’s charm and dirt are slowly being removed – hotels, chain restaurants and shops as well as office supplies stores are now filling buildings that used to have independent stores – a handful of amazing specialty record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these stores when I try to evaluate by observing their age and emotional tempo.
A Glasgow-based Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (a calculator: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (a calculator: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends her afternoon in London on a dungeon, and spends her afternoon in London.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"It's all me," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the photo above (he sent a sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can re-purchase those he sold when he was young and moneyless.
"A lot of the material I bought was from the late '60s and early '70s, the albums that were released when I was 11 or 12, the albums that I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their company, adding: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my fault.”
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients she meets fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media’s enthusiasm. People who have heard that the albums are back in fashion and who have come to the need to buy their old albums back.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have generally gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their CDs back,” he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl deposits of a certain age.
But what about the alleged labeling of the records?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community for similar types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been injured, especially by the near-payment system.
Some vinyl fans may hibernate from the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar album covers; items that evoke memories of adolescence.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling the gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee said abruptly from the surface of the record.
An April poll conducted by the ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had purchased vinyl in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a disc player that they never use, while 7% of vinyl buyers do not have a disc player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously worried when browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This “reward” aspect of the awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who also works in Sounds of the Universe, has noticed.
“Someone came in a little while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big deal, but this is definitely the case.
More products, less music.
We've got people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fopp, which today has almost the entire floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-plus couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned moves - from the speakers to the freshest of Wild Beast's sin and sex-filled pop, and not the improvisational jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to demonstrate a palpable psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppia for a few minutes watching various records on sale.
He's making window purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says it doesn't make much money, so disc collecting isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." she whispers in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I was trying to look like I was researching jeans shorts, I spotted a group of teen girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before father and daughter thought about buying a Crosley disc player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covering the records of Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It's purely art vinyl.
But given that even the slightest attention these items receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho Cancers to pick up more, here’s not much to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the proportion of people who are more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one who spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They don’t really spend their Thursday mornings painting around the Berwick Street record stores, browsing through the records and avoiding the gaze of a grim, 30-year-old man-of-the-mill television presenter who is poking around on the shoulders of middle-aged, unintelligent men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifespan than any other spinal cord on the planet.
According to Julius Nielsen, the record is in a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters long.
French court rejects application to dismantle trades in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected Calais’s request to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the jungle camp, which houses thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut with a single euro or sell tea for a further 50 cents (40 pence).
The Prefectural Office of Calais argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent taxes on unpaid co-financing and because they are a risk of fire and cleanliness.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital by saying that free meals provided by the state-sponsored organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for the evacuation of 72 people involved in interim trade, but said the Calais prefect's concerns were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding "extremely insecure" people.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
The Jungle Book Kids’ Cafe, a non-profit camp offering 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors, was one of the places under the landing line.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafés.
A letter sent to the Guardian said the closure of the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to its peak - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than the EU average.
Food is getting cheaper in Finland for the pleasure of consumers and for the detriment of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen in Finland to the second most in those EU countries with a similar salary level as in Finland.
In the United Kingdom alone, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is revealed by Ilkka Lehtisen, Statistics Finland’s Development Manager, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the overall evolution of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the price level of 1994.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then came the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year after year.
Now the price is weighed by the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increasing price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, the price contest has been shown as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a haven for low-cost food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland with a similar salary level as in Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the countries had the same VAT rate, the cheapest food would be sold in Finland for the third time in terms of wages from similar countries.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the value added tax rate was seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to get to the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to have VAT halved to the EU average and continue price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen notes that the calculations he made at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
When you return to school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for the schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all secondary schools.
It is an instruction that operates in all schools in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beautiful writing is abandoned, and instead the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies begin to be read at the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of the students.
Previously, it was thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make schooling more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The well-known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the zoo, it is only surpassed by an Icelandic cockroach, whose oldest known individual is dated to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks float along the North Atlantic Ocean.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to surveys, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified adult ice sharks from the 28 females that had remained in the fisherman's catch.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon restriction of the lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters of amazon, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice cucumbers only reach sexual maturity by more than four meters, the researchers calculated that they are around 150 years old at the time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired to nearly 300 - sellers not deducted
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann’s department store company.
The cooperatives in a troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, the majority of which will be laid off," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of department stores is not reduced so that customer service is not affected.
In addition, about 80 employees of support functions are offered a new job as a salesman.
Stockmann's Yt-Negotiations concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the outset, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at an annual cost savings of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, which are to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million in savings this year.
The bottom line is Stockmann’s difficulties in making a profit from the warehouse shutdown.
Although the Group’s adjusted turnover improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the goods market is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalais, CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not exceeded the company’s objectives.
“Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive business result in 2018,” Veijainen said in a statement.
The result improvement for the second quarter was mainly based on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved its best second-quarter turnover and earnings of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona L<0xC3><0xA1>ng.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but to the south there will be peat.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the rainy regions of the north, it stays at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletic team rocked by doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's tempo
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in the doping test.
According to the AP news agency, the athlete Anzrah tried to appear in is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
The Kenyan national team's Stephen Arab Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials visited the Anzrah authorities in a statement.
He said Anzrah was sent home because he had "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour,” Kenya’s Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic gymnastics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich placed fourth in the World Cup last year and is ahead of Rio’s winning favourites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah used an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals at the gym.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid of revealing,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio's All-Athletic Stadium is closing in on its void
Where's everybody?
At least they don't watch sports at the Rio Olympic Stadium.
On Friday in Rio, the fight for the medals in athletics began, but the world’s top athletes were able to present their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio organisers said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day’s morning races and 65% of the tickets for the evening races had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium buzzed about the crowd.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games in Rio have already attracted the attention of viewers before the athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in rugby, melon and horseback riding venues.
When Brazilian medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the viewer was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000-seat spectators were full.
At least the bad losses are explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling in economic difficulties, is far from being Europeans and Asian racers, and many of the Olympic species are bizarre for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to fully smuggle the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the organisers, said that 82 percent of tickets had been sold at the time, which is a much lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million remaining items for sale," Andrada told Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold in London, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and army personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to lesser-known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball on the sand of Copacabana has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskiasolo competed in London in 2012.
The people in the newspapers were enough.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Acquire Right to Land
The Helsinki Foundation contributes to nature conservation by the newest means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires its ownership of ecologically significant natural areas.
Subsequently, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem ownership rights in the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapis.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks that can be acquired by those willing to pay for ownership rights.
The holder receives a veto right for a block of 187 square meters, which means in practice that not every holder needs approval if the purpose of land use is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for multiple blocks.
Acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be inherited or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go carrying banners or hug yourself somewhere in order to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired a management company.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives precise location information from the block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of holders of ownership rights are displayed on the same map where the block information of the land area can be found.
The Foundation sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation will act in some way unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect the natural areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or donating.
It finances its operations mainly by selling ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It is also aiming outside Finland’s borders and is planning to acquire it from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Trade Fair on August 13-19.
Bike thefts are the worst in major cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your hometown
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the most in Finland’s major cities.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen compared to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on reported bicycle thefts to the police, Helsinki Sanomat found out how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
Well, that's a big difference.
“In other cities, the number of thefts is double in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others,” police inspector Tommi Reen said.
Market police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer to that.
"The prevalence of alerts can be influenced by how much bikes are being driven in the city and how many bikes there are," says Chief of Staff Teemu Ämäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on what are the study and cycling cities.
The market has a dense center, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
“Espoo, for example, is a very different type of city, where the city centres are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, there were slightly fewer bike thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in the past few years, police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
That means 50-60 fillars a day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a criminal record of bicycle theft, although less than one in 10 police reports are made clear.
Typical of the bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also cases in connection with other investigations where, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drugged apartment," Reen says.
Bicycle thieves are arrested in Helsinki on a weekly basis in connection with the crime itself or with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from shopping malls’ wheel racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike racks, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually kept.
Like in previous years, the most stolen of the individual bicycle models are the Jopo.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the wheel for their own short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on sale via the net, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not learned that stolen wheels would go abroad very much,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of a cover-up crime or offence.
“The alarm clocks should ring if the bike is in good condition and sold at a clear low price,” Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special librarian, wears the colourful Nopsana always during his working days to the protectors of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen, says Hirvi. "It has never been taken, it has been a good monk."
"Perhaps this is not so attractive to thieves, there may not be any hypnotic value here," Hirvi, from Helsinki, reflects.
In the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike slammed the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its wheels to something fixed, such as a wheelchair.
“You have to think about it a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says the student of Helsinki about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, such smash-jobs."
A bicycle was stolen from Valve himself from the company's yard a year ago.
The wheel had not been locked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be reassembled.
15-year-olds responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer teams from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer team is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal investigation.
Initially, the trial will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now devoid of criminal liability.
The peer-to-peer team intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer team will discuss with the perpetrator of the crime and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator can join the peer-to-peer team to make up for the crime.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Warfare, says the model is not strict.
We also have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are directed in a more responsible direction so that everything does not go to waste from the first mistake,” says Laitio.
The Peer-to-peer team has taken a model from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person does not face an adult panel, but reflects what has happened with people of almost the same age.
The model has been tested once.
After the experiment, the service design agency Palmu service designer Ikka Lovio says that it was an abuse that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of those under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all.
“It’s been a message to continue on your chosen path,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer team is part of the Helsinki Immigrant Youth Project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and Me-Stiftung.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want the Party to Stop Financing Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a copy of it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee to Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channeled to congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his recklessness, incompetence and record inequalities, threaten to give Democrats a voice in these elections," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds to congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a prominent Republican who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want to protect their party's majority in Congress" and that it is not a endorsement of anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. children's families
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am trying to be president so that the American economy is going well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is striving to be president so that the economy is going well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a statement.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure -- roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The construction program is an extension of the American dunes, who suffer from the move of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-wage jobs since World War II.
We are a building people, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to facilitate the status of working families.
On Thursday, however, he sounded from Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. as a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“[As president] I oppose all trade agreements that act against workers or salaries,” Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program announced by Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for “only favoring such millionaires.”
Trump’s proposal for a sweeping reduction in corporate taxation has previously been called “Trump’s pigtails.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded listeners of small businesses whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making products in America himself,” Clinton tweeted.
These are the Rio viewer numbers: The races have not glued the Finnish ones to the boxes, but the mobile app is interested
Typically, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached any spectators.
Once and for all, the races have glued to the box at their best 12% of the population: Tuesday evening swimming was followed by the Yle Olympic channel TV2 615,000 spectators at the same time.
For comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships attracted a fair second million.
So far, the most interesting of the Olympic games have been the Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day of the competition, which both reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the spectator numbers, and reminds that spectators will be split in several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns are following the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympic Games in general.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the show comes 24 hours a day, with viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London or 2008 Beijing, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s race broadcasts will come in Finland at night.
The second reason for the interest in the prize - if someone now considers it to be prized - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the original parts, the interest would have been pumped upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other Finnish species of interest: sailing and horseback riding.
At the beginning, the number of viewers was close to expected, according to Pokkisen.
When the sport begins, the spectator numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the races, which rose in the first days of the races as the most free app in the Apple App Store in Finland.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're going to be 200,000 downloads now.
"We'll only get online viewer numbers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena hasn't worked for all users desirable.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the bugs have been repaired.
There has been a delay in the use of Rio Arena and other small technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have received updated versions, which should fix the bugs.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle canals and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can be watched by some species, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts races on a daily basis.
The Olympians are not only perhaps the working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 meters.
It might be even deeper.
Technician diving instructor Matti Kannela found about 20 square meters of pressure in Ristisel, the bottom of which the dive computer looked 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to reinforce the observation by beam scanning.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of one hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi are more than 80 metres away.
They have not been studied as closely as the Day of Judgment.
In particular, the base of the Inari lake has not been accurately mapped.
“There might well be some unknown depths,” Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
With this in mind, your Day cannot reach the deepest ten, and Summer Water is even further from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 14:29: Fixed the last track where the deepest lakes at their middle depths were wrong.
Retirement Taxes: Retirement Taxes Still Tightened
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the discrepancy came under the parliamentary elections and the pensioners' taxation was promised to be equal to the wage earners.
The Government's proposal does not include such a proposal.
In our opinion, it should definitely be there.
“The promises made should be kept after the election,” he told Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, there were job cuts that eased taxation.
The matter was heated in the parliament by opposition representatives, who charred then-Financial Minister Alexander Stubbi (co.) of the election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalinen, the tax cuts presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpon (co.) are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax cut will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Orpo’s desire to respect the competitive agreement reached with difficulty.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the strength of the social partners, so it should not be challenged.
It is needed because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own faith in the future.
Responsible for long-term unemployment
Ialainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget sector, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will be eliminated.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the promise.
U.S. Ambassador: No Finnish terrorists reported in Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in bombings in Thailand yesterday evening and last night in Finnish time.
The Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists going to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finnish people in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The travel season for Finnish Thais is set for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finnish people in particular in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attack is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and last week’s referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who said they were against the law.
In Thailand’s southernmost provinces, the ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: strikes are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in a day after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including popular tourist spots in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination also popular among Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require any deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
In the recommended tourist destination in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one of the double bombers died.
In South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is transported to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngin and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of Thailand’s ruling military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not make people panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges the Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns going to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and about their victims.
It's time to get a little more information about yesterday's attack in Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians are among the injured.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the famous bell tower.
Thai PBS says police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, which it believes has found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal worker died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quarterfinals
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the R<0xC3><0xAD>o Championships with permanent, jumping and booms.
Biles has managed women's gymnastics to a certain extent in recent years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the quarter-finals and permanence championships three times in a row, both last and second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The darker World Cup medals Biles has a jump and a boom.
Thai entrepreneur: "Isuko has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in Phuket, Thailand, has not been concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, then I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, estimates Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies experienced in Thailand from close proximity.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these trips have not expelled tourists in the past, hardly this either.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. local time and said that it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beachfront and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning as a result of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were placed because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to the festive Friday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the movements of the main street were allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
Many people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
Halfway through three hours of Thai time in Patong traffic had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, said Huovila, who visited the site.
Later, the car was spotted at the Crown Palace in Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men who could fit the markings hidden in a nearby six-month-old.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of operating a motor vehicle, theft and serious damage.
The police are grateful for the hints.
Head of research on changes in Russian leadership: a clear move to the sidelines
In Russia, the highest-ranking leadership change took place on Friday, years after President Vladimir Putin resigned his administration chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is a former diplomat and has served as Ivanov's second husband.
The reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has had a quarrel with other executives or has been smuggling.
Ivanoville (disambiguation)
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, is moving on to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
In a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the move was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for the transfer to other posts and proposed replacing Vaino, Russia Today said.
According to Kangaspuro, from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear downfall.
In Russia, environmental and transport issues are not of very high priority.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president Dmitry Medvedev.
The paper notes that the old arc, for example governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place is that Putin is changing his immediate neighborhood to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shield as they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Military Council of Manbij.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians have been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Fixed from previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we erroneously reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s line-up on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The courier told STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own lines, but rather on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participations of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of guidance from the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the calendar of the Minister and not in the accounting records.
The head of the Ministry of Communications tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time.
He was injured in his back yard from the start and had to miss the Olympic Games in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better condition.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-waisted samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Around Bolt, Porina points out that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's previous Olympic loss came in Athens in 2004, when he sprinted at the start of the 200 metres in a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed by injuries and a loose workout posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, breaking the world record and the competitor’s confidence despite the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached his career by measuring the clock.
The world record of 9.58 metres in Berlin and 19.19 metres in Berlin is still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second subsidence, but no one else believes in its birth but Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger for Satasella Bolt is the Olympian Justin Gatlin of Athens in 2004.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt beat the American by only one hundredth.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the World Cup, if only he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt fills up in a lot of weeks after 30.
He is an old man in the young men's races, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the world championships in London for the last time in his career.
These are the Olympians that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping Crime
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic trainer was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epohormone.
She finished fourth in the women’s 100-metre butterfly race in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua says that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide had been found in a sample given by Xinyin on Sunday.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya has moved a sports coach from Rio to his home due to a doping crisis.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had behaved in a test situation as an athlete and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, it is a Kenyan high-speed trainer, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich’s race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps - historic gold came into display style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps, swam in the 200-metre mix in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same kind of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino placed second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I’m just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in the quick interview with Evening.
The story of Helen Skelton on Monday is one of the most read this week on the website of Iltalehti.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t stress much if there’s a slight tingle in his revealing and special outfits in the som or in the British press.
Television is a visual medium, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short-sleeved dress that has at least enough exposure - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and small bangs are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to tinker and maybe he’s confused, but he stresses that he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are watching sports here, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the tide has risen as far as Finland?
I can't, but all that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how much sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton squirms.
You know what?
It’s a shame if it comes from (the conductor’s) dress.
I'm curious to see if this has hit anyone.
Rio police made two arrests on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said on Thursday they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety of the races.
The police made five other arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All of the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by the police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees were known to incite violence on social media.
Violent messages were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of the Rio races is under the responsibility of 85,000 police officers.
Police detonated suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-class match of the Rio basketball tournament in the empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
Police released the package to the public after it had detonated.
This is the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public came in when the police had controlledly detonated the package.
The public did not report to the audience at the start of the match, as the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police exploded the package and allowed the audience to enter the hall only after that.
It was a dreamy start to the Spanish team.
With two losses the races started by Spain won Nigeria points 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain won silver.
The police carried out a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time, police had to explode a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of the paintwork site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty spectators.
Argentine lady stabbed Petäjä-Sirene - Finnish thought about protest
The wind of Petäjä-Sirene had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind was heavy on Thursday.
The Argentine lady slammed the Wind Pepper-Siren on Thursday in Rio on the opening day of the Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant conceded the breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others fled, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete has long considered protests.
This was not to be done because it would have been in vain under the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund, said Pete-Siren.
The Finn hung on his table until the last time because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
The Finn was in 27th place after the accident.
In total, the 2012 London Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
With regard to the car, the accident did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day when there is a race on departures 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first knowledge, Pete-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things That Science Says Will Extend Life
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into a person’s life.
Some of the things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that their life lengthens.
Sometimes again, things that the person himself cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include, among other things, the tendency to middle-class obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don't always have to fry - just getting a milkshake is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored by a number of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest results of the study.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beef and coffee
Coffee production has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially with neurological or heart disease.
There are studies in favor of alcohol that suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that winemakers lived to be older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can prolong a person’s life by up to six years, one study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents meningitis.
In turn, they can help to erupt other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway found how laughter affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be alive after the trial ended.
Sex, when it comes to protecting against sex diseases, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex on its own is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Exercise, of course, will bring extra years, there is no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute coherence.
In fact, a study by the University of Oxford found that women with a large backside had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality rates.
Whether it’s an Olympic medallist athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings extra years to his life.
Some researchers, in turn, suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, in turn, allows, for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study investigating shopping behaviors in people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, or less likely to be a parent shopping.
This is due to the fact that in concrete trades spinning reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that could precipitate death.
So, put your credit card out of your hands - online shopping therefore does not have the same effect.
Drunk driving drunk slammed into truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crash took place in Koskola.
The accident occurred in Koskela, in the middle of Koskentia and Sorvastonti on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car encountered had been driven on the same strip, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained upright after the crash, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car sat down in a straight line and from there I ran over the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the University Central Hospital in Turku.
The result of the woman’s bloating test was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of a heavy wheel intoxication.
Post sent debris to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket’s discards range had shortcomings because the mail had delivered some of the cargo accidentally to Maueräjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying discards from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in the dismantled ones, because the Posti delivered our cargo to Wandäjoki!
We will get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
So if you don't pack in the lawn mower, you read the sign.
The trader’s waving sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowers.
Grass cutter is always on offer by Post until the end of August.
In his opinion, the poster was mostly fun and he decided to share it on social media.
I was struck by the popularity of the update.
Even media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention on this matter is unbelievable, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Halsia got her own favorites caught in a discard bag, even though a few drawers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the Transport Services of Posti Companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five scenes went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but only today we brought five scenes, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was first reported by the Evening Sayings.
Teija Halt did not get bored with the sign because she found all of her discarded favorites in the selection.

The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Victim’s Memories for Police Dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered by donating flowers and addresses to a police dog.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update, in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked at the Veterinary Station in Sipoo as a substitute and also had a nurse training there.
The veterinarian's office remembers the words touching the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless work.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds go in full to police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safe dogs.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkyla.
Neighbors of the woman have told Eventaleh that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and cats.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and they had no contact with each other.
A police dog named Börje was involved in the search for the killer, who was injured in a life-threatening arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
District Court Sentenced to Post for Violation of Equality Act
The Post did not have the right to detain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the hired worker, Kanta-Hämee County Court in its judgment.
The District Court required Posti to pay the majority of the detainee’s salary and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgement, the Posti could have detained only a part of the employee’s salary that accounted for the share of the employee’s day-to-day work.
According to the District Court, an employee was placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the organisational decision of the Postal and Logistics Union PAU on the prohibition of familiarisation.
During last November’s post office, the PAU made a decision that the Post’s employees did not familiarize themselves with strike-breaking hire workers.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey must return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalistic Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilas and Soini to express their concern for Turkish freedom of speech and the press.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly pointed out to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of speech.
Putin Resigns His Commander-in-Chief to Replace Estonian-style Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
Anton Vaino, son of Karl Vaino, the Communist leader of the Soviet-Estonia, will be replaced.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
He will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency said.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to a Kremlin press release, Ivanov, a close insider of Putin, is shifting to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other positions and proposed replacing Vaino, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union on the spying of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin’s re-election to the presidency in 2012.
BBC: ManU's Giant Procurement for Game Ban - Not Seen at Opening of the Premier League
The world record holder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off on the weekend.
Paul Pogban's pelikielto is accompanied by England.
Manchester United's Paul Pogba is on the sidelines because of a game ban when ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million fee for Pogba to Juventus, according to the British media.
However, the Football Association of England (FA) kept him out of the game, as Pogbal was under pressure from Juventus.
He received two warnings last season in the Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
The ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, bigotry is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of the entertainment have established the status of the Flow Festival as an internationally recognized event, which is highlighted by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festive hikers have typically expressed themselves with their own peculiar outfits.
One of the main artists is this year’s punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival is stalled with art galleries and art installations, among others.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main platform and a bowling alley,” says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
This weekend’s Flow Festival in Helsinki’s Suvilah has grown from a small street festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The key to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the actors themselves want to go to?
It is quite different in event productions to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to an end this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5 000 people last year.
This year, the festivals will also feature a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to finance it in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle ranch, which is driven on huge roads.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has swelled, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars in the partially artificial area.
In addition to the main platform and smaller playgrounds, this year there will be tents for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bigoted, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow alive.
If it disappears, this is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done by Kalli is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-twentieth century, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of around 20,000 euros.
Last year, the company operating Flow had a turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
With it, you can achieve "circular things" such as the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own peculiar outfits.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all in terms of content.
However, fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow’s value world: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main performers is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indie rock, pop, rap and sound.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booed because this is probably the last time this will be seen in Finland.
We care about everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is fucking good and he's done some fucking good things in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower box and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreign customers.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet correctly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists in Hua Hin.
People ran up to me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened at one of the biggest bars, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Shortly thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, favoring the Finns.
I don't think anyone's dead.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In Trang, a bomb exploded.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings, which are not happy with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently become involved in the activities of criminal organizations dealing with trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new ready forces will go to battle first in case of war
In the event of an acute situation of war, the armed forces are not ordered to carry out combat duties until several months after taking an oath of war, says the Central Finn.
According to the head of training of the Defence Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnisen, who served for 5.5 months in wartime, only those who are in the final stage of their training are eligible for combat.
According to the training manager, the service will be assigned first to the reserve personnel belonging to the paramilitary forces.
No armored personnel or reservists are ordered to carry out a task that has not been given the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin to train the armed forces to the units of immediate readiness from next year.
Units may be used in military operations already during the training of the armed forces, if necessary.
Pamela Tola gets huge compensation from hometale
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a fierce dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-storey apartment was EUR 330,000.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a dangerous microbial plant to health.
The couple had to sell their apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to 132,000 euros, so the economic loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to 198,000 euros.
The couple brought the case to court and demanded a price cut from the seller there.
The seller disputed the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both district and court.
The court handed down the case on Wednesday.
It remained in effect with a judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of 47,344 euros for the trial and settlement costs of the couple.
The right reasonably reduced the price slightly, because some of the need for repair of the apartment had been known to the buyers already when making the house trade.
However, according to the Court of First Instance, the errors in the construction were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought good-quality homes because they did not want to do repairs.
He had been given the idea that the building had been fundamentally renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the fitness inspection report.
The audit report referred to ventilation as risks and mismatches and the inadequacy of the management of rain and melting waters along the rock surface.
However, it was not clear from the discussions that this would have been an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma came to the idea that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little in a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 in the building identified microbial plants, which, according to witnesses, were due to both the rainwater of the rock and the capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air polluted by the microbes, according to the inspector's estimate, could also enter the interiors through the window.
In the samples of brooms, the cellar staircase, the window opener in the living room and the basement washroom, allowing for a risk of health, excess of the limit values were found.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of Espoo’s decision to make changes to the apartment prior to the commercialisation.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
Home issues, however, were a key issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for large-scale repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma considered that there was no special reason for a larger inspection than usual.
The buyers have not failed to comply with their reporting obligations, the Court of First Instance states in its judgment.
Karmish archival: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent Dagens Nyheter article that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has documented a total of 218,500 women who wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to marry the Nazis.
The documents and registration cards are issued by a breeding agency based in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was under the leadership of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted on women to find out.
The racial agency investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The race agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-lovers", "saving", and "good national socialists" who knew German very well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The case does not tell how the 14 Finnish women who were found in the archive documents were treated.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program stipulated, among other things, that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program has not been actively promoted, according to the pages of the US Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazis’ population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage expenses by offering loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of the German mother was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.
Sixth of the Traitor Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the sailing on the first departure of the Finnjolli day at the Rio Olympics, but remained a full-fledged peak on the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall position after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in place of 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures in 17th and 3rd places.
In the overall situation, Pete-Siren is sixth.
In the 470th grade, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the start of the day instead of 23.
In total, the Lindgrens are at number 19.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so horny"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favorite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has become the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dances and festivals, still manages to pound and is currently on the rise.
A book written by Mari Koppisen, about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career, both good and bad.
Brillanpää’s career rose to full praise when he won the crown of Tango in 1995 at the Seinäjoki Tango Market.
In Kissa Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed for Bridgenpää a tango piece, which was adapted by Kassu Halonen in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it to the tape in a terrible crawl and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so fucked up!
The bridge remembers in the book.
From the recording of the song, which became a huge hit, it would not be immediately assumed that it was sung in a crib.
Although I was not physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I’ve learned that you don’t have to demand perfection and perfection all the time.
The second incident related to the most popular songs of the man, which the book tells about, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time and the case eventually ended with the lyrics of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered by Saara Törmäsel were not as Sillanpää would have wanted.
Brillanpää had imagined he was doing a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song telling the difference were not true, but it was written based on the 7 days magazine news.
The newspaper's news report reported Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol use as the reason for Jari's separation from his ex-girlfriend, but Jari said it was full of dolls and was not true.
According to the book, Jari played the record company in anger and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting for their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predicted the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of staying in the EU.
Not a single prestigious research institution or university endorsed the distinction, although a couple of individual researchers may disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” is the basic mantra in Western politics, flying into a mudslide in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Category: Economic grammar
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics (CMC) has received responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand economics.
Many still have the notion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it is out of the UK.
Many also have the idea that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economic Committee, voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus among economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly shaken by the BBC’s fairness, which gave as much space as a few percent of the EU’s economy to economists who are in favour of the difference than to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capitalist combinations think about the consequences of the disparity.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economists’ messages were both heard and understood, they were not cared for because economists represent an elite with which voters do not in their opinion have common interests.
Academics in large cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overriding winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant robs your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees in it.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
There are immigrants in the waiting room of each health centre.
How much easier would it be for the British to have doctors if there were no doctors?
There are immigrants’ children in every school.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they were to get rid of them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would there be for the early settlers if they were to disappear?
In my opinion, these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them, and if they did, their responses would not be visible.
Economists have failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investments by the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
In Aberdeen, he said, it was timely to prepare for Brexit by drafting plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the camp for the EU-different, began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have measurable liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit occurred on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only daily open-ended real estate fund covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is about <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or below 10%.
As a result, real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The Funds Closed Trades
When the camp for EU disparity won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
And then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, president of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen their trading.
These together looted the situation and put it in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous about it.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund had to close its doors one by one.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it was also eventually forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old one, they did not actually close the trade, but instead changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be withdrawn in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Mainland European Funds have not had any similar fluctuations.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unreasonably Attention to Real Estate Funds
According to the old one, the closures of real estate funds’ trades received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds, which were covered by the closures, control about 4% of British property.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold off less than ten properties from 80 of its London-based properties.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may be holding back its funds in the middle of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been pushed down, but the situation does not appear to be "sleeker" for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities for some of the real estate investors, notes Vanhanen.
The pound/dollar price is at its weakest for 30 years, plus a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
You can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, says the old man.
Brexit brings downsides to London’s real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem very strange.
But at 4 p.m., when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investment at the UK real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is going to plan B now, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The city of London was still alive in the morning.
TVs normally set to be silent in the office were buzzing the news, and usually the loud crowd was silent to listen completely as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell them about his departure.
When the market opened, the display ends blinked only in red.
It was a morning that he would never have thought he was alive, says Vanhanen.
Not that despite the blizzard, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Begins Correction Movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership switched.
Markets were beginning to predict sharp downturns in the UK and especially London real estate market.
Up to 20 per cent minus were forecast for London office space in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one by one.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the tortoise has dissipated, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer vacation this week in Helsinki.
It is still far too early to say much about what follows from Brexit.
So much is still open: how does the difference occur and how does Scotland react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
The information provided by CBRE on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City’s office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, according to Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't so terrible, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was started to be published in 1987, and in just five months there have been worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman’s collapse and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks the comparison is not quite appropriate, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The feeling is also different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that at the time, but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The money is also found normally.
The remedial action could have been in the forefront anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle to him - one could have been in the forefront without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started from a very high point.
London’s prices have dropped upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalizing, says Vanhanen.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players on the market, and an increasing number of institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced, for example, pension companies to look for yields from new items.
On this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt levy has been used, according to Vanhanen, now clearly less than during the boom preceding the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price rises stabilized last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten his possessions in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of transformation to be expected, and now it's coming.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to estimate much of the future, but says that no climbing peak is allowed.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a declining or steady outflow in front.
The old man has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the cube is solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you’ve invested in one market, there’s too much of it.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register purchase information more accurately than before
At S Group, you know what you’re eating, as the trading group said today it’s starting to collect more detailed information about its stock customers’ purchases.
Once information has been collected on the final amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it in early May for the products purchased as well.
The S-Group is following Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala tells the Economist.
According to him, Kesko will not respond to the S-Group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its stock customers into ten groups based on their food purchases alone.
The classification is updated on a monthly basis.
Position customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from K-Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil will not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-alone client program and is not planning to do so.
Finnish Local Market has its own Ykkösbonus stock customer program, which can be joined in Election Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information on product or product group levels, we remain at the level of the final amount of the invoice.
That is, we know where the purchases were made and the day I and the final invoice of the customer.
We have not gone to the same level as the K-group or the S-group, says commercial manager Anu Ora.
According to him, the stock-customer programme is planned to be renewed in the future, but Nairobi will tell about it later.
Ora, however, does not allow the registration of product information to begin.
First of all, experimentation
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
The basic data included not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, housing, and the years of birth of the child and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, location, final amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded from S-Etukartsostost.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will begin to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, in S-markets, Prismo, Kodi Terro and ABC, data is currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Owner and Partnership.
The S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored on the cash registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
Halukas can check its stored data on the S-Group website.
For example, cash registers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-Puppy is the newest dog reinforcement of the Customs - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
A black labrador retriever’s puppy sniffs five similar boxes in a row at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It doesn’t take long to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite game.
From the box next to which Haila sat, a can of scented shells were revealed.
“Food gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila,” says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce reasons for access
Heila is the first dog to specialize in the search for weapons and explosives of the Customs and will be deployed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if needed.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels triggered measures in the Customs and after the attacks control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, a customs inspector.
Another reason for training a gun and explosive dog to the duties of Customs is the mailings through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With the increase in e-commerce, up to 40 million mail shipments per year pass through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, at Helsinki-Vantaa airport, the customs authorities have made discoveries about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their source materials related to online shopping, passenger luggage and air cargo.
Heila will be working in various parts of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will examine the checked baggage and postal shipments.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on her performance, Tulli assesses whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
Kirkkonummi School
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also trains with Heila at the police and Defense Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantaa are Tull’s six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador breeder Heila has been selected from the puppies of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include ripping and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The sublime orders go to Heila from one to the other.
The Night-Sanomi cameraman loses the protection of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the protection that looks like a soft toy immediately from the "switch" command.
Strict competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still equal opportunities ahead, next in October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work.
Heila can be seen working in Helsinki-Vantaa next half of the year, if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron work suits for a dog on it, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire from the care of their owner.
Work days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs has a lot of competition in customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to be the owner of the ship.
Luck hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs as well as monitoring duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
Fiji’s Olympic gold medal in rugby is so high in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
The day of leave will be held on the following day when the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the heroic team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that the final in the country was followed in the capital Suvala, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijis are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Dramaaa in Rio - Finnish buyer turned around after great performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt of 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after severe lifts, he has been swollen many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from pushing in Rio and 145 kilos from tapping.
His total score was 320 pounds.
Tokola finally tried to gain 175 kilograms, as well as his second.
In the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of a loud scream.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish rider was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Weikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men’s football league, has signed a long-term contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player in our team who has strengths and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went with more than ten player agents through an abundance of 50 players from all over the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn’s Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovanians will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new striker when last season's goalkeeper Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The Threatening Modern Family Star Reveals: Teenage Star Shorts Reveal Nearly Everything
Ariel Winter, best known as Alex Dunphy in the Modern Family comedy series, once again smashes his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also this asshole.
18-year-old Winter has recently gained attention by changing his style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has posed in his social media posts in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen dressing in very narrow clothes.
On the threshold of adulthood, Winter has also recently released several pictures of himself at the party.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more the surface appears, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has angered some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Instead, some of the women’s fans defend the actor and urge them not to give in to criticism.
You look great!
It doesn't matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, glowing young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the revolut: in autumn it is possible to see the random mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start the rafting tours in early autumn, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main tourist destinations of the Japanese are Inari and Levi.
Revontulets are the master cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter rafting trips are in high demand, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
It is not known that the saplings begin early in the autumn and continue into the long spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the thunderstorms, making the vision twice as random, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of the Revontula campaign in Finland are wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of traveling and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land view among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would want clearer unique sights from Finland, and Lind says the revolt has enormous potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased in Finland significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for tourism in Finland, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver in Fiji’s championship course leading to gold
Britain’s impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fidz’s last challenge in Thursday night’s final when the team experienced a 43-7 crushing loss at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master course in handling, breaking, interception, support play, running lines, and silk, winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable consolation from the silver medal - the third of Britain's day - and they were proud of their hard work in the start of the Olympic rugby tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tough 7-5 victory over South Africa in the semi-finals played the same day may have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won even a top 15 team in this condition.
Britain may, but probably not, be comforted by the fact that at least one Britishman has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss of Wimbledon.
The trip to the UK has been quite a long one.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This spinal cord hurts, but the development is staggering.
Fidi started out perfectly against the British tackling for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams, this was like they were running in the direction of buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner of the finish line.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s brilliant backstop stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was only a slowdown for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Blutemala scored in the right corner, and the United Kingdom was 17-0.
Nakarawa again made the goal of a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou jumped through Britain’s loose tackling and pushed onto the line to paint.
After the goal kick, the situation during the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning to play.
And that's what it really is.
The United Kingdom made changes with a pause that blocked Fid’s trap for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fid’s impressive feeding game.
Dan Norton scored for the United Kingdom in a touchdown on the left and narrowed the situation down to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters sang, waved the flags and danced in the spectators.
It was hard not to admire Fid’s cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute goal was a scoring in Fid's cake, which didn't need a scoring.
The pill was bolted, the Fiddlers hugged, and Britain fell into the lawn, completely struck.
Earlier on the same day Fidi had beaten Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in the tight semi-finals, where both scored one goal - the British goal kick ended the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with stunning footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A great late loser from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of England's 15-aside rugby team, secured a victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach’s fight against cancer has led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to victory.
There won’t be any more thrilling gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard runs to history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were both rowing, there were three voices in the boat. Coach Robin Williams' spark was present all the time as the pair contested their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairs competition - the first women in the British sports history books to boast of such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also a record.
This, what we see, the two brilliant athletes connecting the surface with the dungeon of the dungeon, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
At the back of every soutukula, there is a group of helpful hand pairs that gradually promote the things that matter. And no hand pair was as essential as the coach, who did not know until 30 months ago after being diagnosed with cancer, whether he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was accurate.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your way of thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start his treatment in early 2014 off-season, causing as little disruption as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department -- 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it started.
Welding in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thoughts of the pair were Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an Afghan-led experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, said: "I've been a tunner this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin, have worked together.
Three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would be nothing, so he has a big thank you, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The pair set a strict rhythm to which their competitors did not rise.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good fight and winning the race, and so we did.
The couple wait a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend next month’s wedding when she is married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland Replaces Government With Panama Leakages
Iceland is holding early parliamentary elections in October, which were already called for by protesters angered by Panamanian data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-ditch anger of the people will affect the results of the autumn elections.
In the June presidential election, criticism of the overwhelming was clearly seen, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump Says He's Sarcastic in Claiming Obama to Be the Founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has rescinded his most recent shortcomings.
She said she was sarcastically asserting that President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and a participant in the founding of the organization by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone who can sink around like that into the army chief,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of Muslim-favoured burqin swimsuits on beaches, the British newspaper The Guardian reports.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swims for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which in large part express religious ties, may increase the risk of order disturbances in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove a crowd to celebrate French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist men linked to Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the swimming waters in the Oulu region passed through the saw - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the shores of Pyykösjärvi, blue-brown sesame has been observed.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu region’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniem Beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococci bacteria in all bathing waters of the bathing waters were below the limits of the measures provided for in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E. coli and enterococci concentrations of the bathing water in Meriniem were determined on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue-green sediment found on the shore of Lake Pykösjärvi does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green sediment, forming blue-green plates on the water surface.
The environmental action monitors the situation closely with inspections.
In the event that the blue-tailed sesame becomes blue-tailed, this shall also be separately reported on the beach notice board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkaraine Forest Gift Reduction: Over 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s proposed budget next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of a generational change of forestry tax.
In the presentation of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest donations has four objectives: to promote the generational change of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of trees.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest farms is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forest Producers (MTK).
However, the hacker finds a critiqued tax bill.
The Forest Gift Reduction shall be assigned to the net capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions are deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarien, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The VM’s proposal is based on a reduction in the net income of forestry to prevent the loss of income from forestry, which should be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit, even if there is no wood to sell.
The calculation model is quite complex.
The average forest owner can’t figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The limit for the tax reduction linked to the forest’s yield value is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 000.
I think it's been dragged too high.
As such, it eliminated 82 percent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction, he said.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
In the VM it is considered that the boundary guarantees the objective of the cultivation.
According to Hakkarien, the reduction of forest grants has been achieved in forest policy for decades.
Its background is the aging of forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful turbulence surprised the drivers at Himanga - two cars crashed into each other
On Friday morning, there was a special run in the Himanga river.
According to the rescue department, two cars in a row fell in a straight line, after which the rear came into a collision with the front driver.
According to Harri Pyyhtä, a daytime firefighter, the current suffocation is suspected to have been caused by a strong crack.
In the back of the car, two people were transported to the hospital.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the previous vehicle was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent research results of researchers from the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings made by the research group of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumour increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to the cancer cells.
The results were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhoks family murder continues in court, prosecutor demands murder conviction for another perpetrator
The murder of Muhoks continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the family murder committed in Muhoks.
The other was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months, including murder as a young person and gross robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder as a young person and for gross robbery.
He was also sentenced to death for jeopardising road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle as a young person.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecutor is demanding a lesser sentence on a man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full comprehension at the time.
According to the district court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a school child protection officer in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked a driver sitting on the sofa in the living room.
The conductor had escaped from the extract and put the young man in his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the conductor was wired, beaten and kicked to the head.
According to the state of mind study, both convicted were in full comprehension at the time of the crime.
According to the law, the young people had planned to flee the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the world’s longest-lived vertebrate, only growing at 156 years old
Ice sharks have been confirmed to be the world’s longest living vertebrate, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the holker can live up to 400 years.
The female only grows at the age of 156.
The lifespan of the iceberg adds to the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one snail is known to live longer than an ice shark.
The researchers found out the age by radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need another world.
Even a third of all tax revenues in the country would be lost if the change to corporate tax, driven by Donald Trump, is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by the most beneficial tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would drop from 35 percent to 15 percent.
There would be a huge amount of money, $1 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s cut of 33.
Inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump has accused the state of overregulating the business sector and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards adopted by hurricanes must be recast and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be reopened.
The government must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, “destructive” trade policy is one of the major causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be waived.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 per cent and a 35 per cent penalty tax on Mexico.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our religion,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, American planes are going to connect cities, American ships are going to control the seas, American steel is going to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
In contrast, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists – including those close to Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program on early Friday in Finland.
A wave of storms from the past - People's News
The sea is ravaging fatefully, but a real storm strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street line – whether the account of the past can begin.
It summarized the story of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s novelty.
Almodovar’s previous directing work The Travellers (2013) was a small-sized satirical comedy, preceded by Skin in which I live the peaks of a (2011) Spanish tour career.
Levelly Julieta (2016) is somewhere between those two works.
It is a peace-loving, human-relations- and family-relations-chakra at the heart of which is the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and can be seen as a long backdrop.
Life seems to be modeling for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new friend (Dario Grandinetti) must always be in wonder until the end of the film.
In the form of a backpack and a long letter, Juliet recounts the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Juliet as a young teacher, appears in the second female part of the television series The Time Between Ommeltes (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a kitchen, but I would say that time was weak and verbally one-off.
For Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, there is often a fair distance from Juliet to such an ingenuity, always with humor.
It is an evenly played, restrained, a place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish conductor is there and in such a way that it begins to inject a little silently into the eye more as a pure form factor than a functioning dramatic effect.
The characters of the film experience illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same as Korean.
This is especially true for the costume: in the case of the character, the costumes vary from scene to scene, and the same applies to the striking earrings.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main thing is that the arrangements of the scene at that time are not particularly relevant.
When mechanically repetitive, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a screenplay based on three novels by Canadian novelist Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Tales.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced literary filming.
The subject matter would have been emotionally incomparable to a stronger drama, so many big things - especially a palpable guilt - the theme of the film is addressed.
Directed and scripted by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premiere is 12.8.
Government is trying to run for election - People's News
No new cuts are being made, the Ministers say, so that the Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are made in the rag trade.
There will be no further cuts.
The already decided savings of 4 billion is sufficient.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (co.) under the budget line.
This is true in the light of the fact that there are no further cuts in the draft of the VM, as social security cuts were decided already in the spring frame.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be reduced by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment insurance will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training cuts continue.
Municipalities are haunting
Why do the ministers stress the very fact that no further cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipal elections are held in April, and they are the most important indicator of the election season, not the gallups.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the municipal elections leading in different directions will ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
The Gallupi, however, say that the Finnish government party expects a slump loss, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Finns received 752 new delegates, many of which will realize the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life span of three governments of roughly the same size is dependent on the fact that the canvas of the Finns will last.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party who voted had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation have also come to the surface.
First of all, the rhetoric does not obscure the fact that next year they will be carried out vigorously, and secondly, they will try to soften the upcoming attack on the Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of folding the debt in this term, but Petteri Orpo’s draft budget will take on debt next year 5.9 billion euros, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt is not slowed down or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means new even tougher cuts on the former in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be at least close to equilibrium during 2018 and then, in the spring, what is to come will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
With these actions, there is no debt.
It is quite clear that with current actions, there is no debt, although Juha Sipilä tries to inflame the positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe at the Budget Disclosure Event prove it indiscriminately:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal from the international economy.
Finland’s economy has barely risen since its collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over the past decade, extending from an average of 34 weeks to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäi, public debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the next half-decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief presented by the leftist union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion, which will be covered practically by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the perception of the centre, the assembly and the Finns of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of work to the city
Three out of four consider that the organization of child day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also pass on responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic institutions, building control, high school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is most clearly expressed in the areas of provincial development, special care, vocational training, vocational colleges and institution care for persons with developmental disabilities.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities is intended to be transferred to the state.
Underage drunk driving driver runs behind the scenes after police flee
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu fled the police force in Joensuu on Friday night at half an hour.
The police tried to stop the motorcycle without the lights, but the young man went to drive the police to escape with a fair speed.
The trail continued to Sonkajanrannanti, from where it continued to Sorronahontia and to the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove off the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed policeman ran to catch the runner.
The driver’s breath test showed 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driver’s license to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, inter alia, as a serious risk to road safety.
A truck in the quarry crashed.
A truck in Kivilastas crashed at Polvijärvi on Kaavinti on Thursday night at 21.15.
The train had drifted out of the road in a left-hand corner and fell towards its side.
The rescue team pulled the injured driver out of the crashed hole through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter's staff and first responders.
It was the responsibility of the car owner to lift the vehicle.
From the fallen shrimp, hydraulic oil flowed into the road, which the rescue team absorbed into the oatmeal.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Ilmajou
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoi village in South Pohjanmaa.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters long, slim and horny with white hair under her chin.
Observations and hints of missing movements are requested to call Pohjanmaa Situation Centre's reference number 0295440513.
Materials of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest ruins
The flooding of the tents of the Parafest festivals caused massive destruction.
Arto Pippuri, president of the Joensuu Parafesty Association, estimates that the festival will be financially rewarded, and the event can also be organized next year.
The last performance of the Parafest Kalle Salonen took place at the end of Friday evening on the torilla.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the premises of the City Theatre starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1pm to 3pm.
The program is being planned.
A downstream flow occurs in a cloud of clouds when rainwater and its weight trigger a falling airflow.
Changes in the state of the cloud of water bind heat, and therefore the falling air cools and accelerates its speed towards the ground.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there are a number of falls in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the downpour.
The downpour hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell to the ground, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly injuring themselves.
Among them was one child, who was transported to follow-up treatment with a slight injury.
Air Pollution Aging in London
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is ageing faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The study is based on the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than, say, a colleague living in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are a very fine dust contaminant, which is derived from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 people in London each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk especially for those in London who go on business trips walking near crowded streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with a variety of masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular cleansing of the skin.
Tractor brakes betrayed a man standing in front of you
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor managed to reach a man so empty that he was transported to the central hospital for further examinations seriously injured.
The tractor couldn’t go any further because it hit the stones in front of it.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Champions League of Volleyball, will start the series in October with better starting points than men’s.
The team has been around for almost three weeks.
The common tune is certainly better found than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team for being entrepreneurial and unified.
Fred Musoni from the foreign trio starts his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-cent hacker.
Garchet is a passerine, the Brazilian is 198 centimeters tall.
Josban, Kataja and Jokiboys to the U.S. National Team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all of the World Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere are already going for its sixth race, only in 2013 missed Canada being better in the North American races.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy national team.
I was interested and here it is, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species has not yet been played at the SM level as a salibandy.
The ball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipoj in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the SM-series of the 1991-92 season, the next three passes passed in Josba.
While playing, he trained the A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series 10 times, the balance was 169 games 51<0x2B>34<0x3D>85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, a native of Finland, was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Republic’s Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old striker in Helsinki, has played this before six men’s landscaping, with a total of 9<0x2B>4<0x3D>13 points.
The 32-year-old defender of Switzerland’s Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a travel problem and is part of the standard team’s 117 fielding experience.
Mika Kohonen, a coach of the Seinäjoki Peliveljie, was also named to the national team, which was last seen in the Finnish shirt at the World Cups last December.
The head coach of the Salibandymaa team is the Kontio Bayer Petri Kettunen.
Beach volleyball club Essi Hasun circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize drawer
Essi Hasu is about to retire as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be held this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
Within three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Association and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the top six pairs in each series ranking.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäne NMKY, who has been among the Finnish beach volleyball tops for several years.
Today in Helsinki, Hasu is eagerly awaiting games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the show this weekend.
It's definitely going to be a great arena for the wash.
I haven’t played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu said.
The area of Kouvola lit up Hasun’s spark for sport and gave good vibes for a great hobby.
There are many memories of childhood in my mind.
When I was 9 years old, I started flying ball in E-girls at Elimäen NMKY.
The most important thing in mind is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that are rotating in the ankles, as well as amazing ascents and choreographies after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other.
The team’s collective spirit created an environment in which it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of a teammate coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was a natural choice as a counterweight to the indoor flight ball as a junior.
The beach at Kurrälamme has been playing baits since the 1990s.
The user has always been active.
I also went to the Junior SM Tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkisen in the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-placed double in the tournament is clear.
Realistically, we have a medal.
The SM gold is still missing from the prize drawer, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasul’s last in front of a well-known audience.
At the beginning of September, there will be new challenges in civil service.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toenails are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Crash flow dropped tents for disabled people in Joensuu, major accident was close

There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, a firefighter interviewed by Karjalien, told the newspaper that there was material for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is on the horizon.

Solomon Koli bravely went on to become a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweating and inertia.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli soon started working with his little brother Valtteri Koli as a successor to their home state two years ago.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting out as a rural businessman meant borrowing and increasing to the farm so that bread could be taken over by agriculture.
This has been my business since I was a kid.
I’ve always loved the farm, and now that I’ve started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself went really bravely into the project and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything is still going well.
The goal of Salomon Koli, a meat truck grower, is to invest in an even bigger nave.
The work has produced results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the magazine Rural Future.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
The national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
As of July 2016, the cost-of-living index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as last month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is criticized as an Asian cartoonist
According to Snapchat, the anime has acted as an inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers, it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to edit reality and play with identities in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, face-turning tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized for accusing the app of promoting a blackface, or “mustanaama” mask, or preferring bleached skin color as a beauty design.
So when Snapchat advertised this week to some users a lens that gave them slender eyes, slender teeth, and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface" or yellowface.
And they wondered if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company’s greater problem with diversity.
News and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for observers experiencing racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly opposed anime comparisons.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photos was widely shared, said in her email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with the most coarse Asian charcoal style and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow filter, but a yellow filter exported to extreme degradation.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood, to the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially older audience of more diverse young people may mean that they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends a user, “it’s much harder for these guys to be unnoticed.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believes race-related disputes reflect Snapchat’s lack of diversity of pay practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white male leadership and concluded his post with the hashtag <0x23>DeleteSnapchat (<0x23>DeleteSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colours on their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colours at work, but they're not in positions where they would feel safe or could wear yours."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racialization of its staff, but the representative said the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on under-represented populations and move forward with internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, “Is it true that they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not okay?”
Congressional Panel Says Military Officials Misrepresent ISIS Intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, the congressional panel said authorities had modified intelligence reports from the U.S. military headquarters to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground justified.
The annual report of the working group, set up by the Republican Chairman of the House Defense Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" with their assessment of the main office's intelligence analysis, amongst the hundreds of analysts who
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces War Zone in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs approved by the top-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground warranted by the facts in the reports. They were regularly more positive in the reports than in the surveys.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our fighters in the war suffer when poor analyses are presented to high-value decision makers,” Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said in a statement.
The failures of Centcom’s management will go all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in the mainland’s descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that the Obama administration’s high-ranking administration has ordered the reports to be dumped, it depicts analysts feeling as if the leaders of Centcom had put pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonials from the mainland to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
Centcom, for example, has publicly stated that a major attack to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under the control of ISIS.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officials at the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the intelligence outputs of the headquarters to mitigate the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans, after consulting the working group, said analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence information about the Islamic State.
The report, which was published on Thursday, will follow up with more extensive results as the investigation is underway.
The Department of Defense inspector has initiated an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's enquiry.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some of the Republican working groups.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process that was in vain isolated from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s chief Democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of the intelligence drafts", aggravated the mood among analysts and "did not leave enough room for differing perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with a “pre-set or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that a Pentagon reviewer has begun an investigation following complaints from analysts at Centcom.
Captain Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector’s investigation was underway.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The investigation also has other follow-up consequences, other than just the question of whether US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense authorities now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the war operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic State’s intelligence in 2003 reflects more than a decade of controversy when Centcom’s intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote an investigative paper stating that, in spite of a number of analysts’ criticisms, President George W. Bush’s administration supported it.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion over Islamic State intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker group concluded that, despite the opposite public opinion, the crackdowns on Islamic State-run refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the discovery was not reported outside the headquarters, however.
Centcom’s then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins fourth consecutive women’s field hockey by holding an interim hearing with Britain
The day after scoring three goals for Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday with the Americans beating India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure he had done the same thing before.
“I have no idea,” he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a book of his own."
But he knows this: The Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, who was still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The United States and Britain will face each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game decides who will be the first and who will be the second in their six-team group.
The first placer avoids the strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, for a little longer at the start of the quarterfinals.
Whatever Saturday’s game ends, the Americans have aroused tremendous success here, four years after they stayed at the London Olympics for the last of the 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey team for the first time at the age of three (his older twin sisters were playing species at Drexel) and joined the team at the age of 16, making him the youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not qualify for his final season.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the same job in London as we do now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday evening, Bam started the first half of the scoring process with a scoring close to the goal.
India had come into the game with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in the 1-0 draw until the end of the third round, when Bam took control of the situation.
He transported the ball for a long time to the left of the field, then circled in the middle and kicked the ball to the goal, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added a fourth in the middle of the final goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper of the tournament for Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
And so is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline Peace in the middle of the Olympic Mountains
No matter where you are, no matter what the weather is, the Olympics are underway.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a continuous and inevitable, furious message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympics itself are a sparkling messaging messaging that's transmitted from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlete.
It is impossible to turn on television, read newspapers, or listen to a guest’s conversation in the cafe bar without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-time and upcoming heartbreaker with a smile, could well be one of the names of all those who are introduced at the best time of the year and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-mind TV ads - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or a male.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for the Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic torch does not illuminate all species equally.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air gun fire, archery, slingshot, taekwondo.
We always have breastfeeding, as long as it lives.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to pay attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, its presence has been so low over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the race, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share medals for men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China’s Dong Dong and Canada’s Rosie McLenna defend their gold medals in London.
However, the trampoline is accompanied by a certain kind of sub-response charm, partly because the uncivilized ear sounds better suited to the clown school than the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I'm not an expert, I'm just an incompetent fan.
The species has opportunities for amusement, as can be seen from the color of the endless pumps of cartoons, but it also has the versatility of gymnastics and swimming jumps, two species that in principle combine.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means a springboard.
Championship seekers jump up to almost 30 feet in height on a giant trampoline, and have to perform sliding business sequences (translations, skills and volts) and finally get down on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those wishing for a medal must go further, faster, up and over in search of gold - sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the television news, for another daunting limit: the world record or the Olympics.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and it can even make the viewer cry.
But that’s also the reason why watching the races can be a bit tiresome.
The trampoline offers a rest for this.
The trampoline's up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to the new rise and seems weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
This, of course, is not without competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no fierce rush to the end, no jumps to the distance, only a sleepy, lucid interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to the Zen state as can be reached at the Olympics.
The women's boxing competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at the beginning of the broadcast at 13:00 (ET), the men's races will also be held on Saturday at 13:00.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the middle of the Olympic hut, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticeable in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering men’s athletes to watch and entertain (as U.S. men’s athletes suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley just waits for his suffocating new fanaticism.
"Generation Shows Its Mind" in Ethiopia, which is a long-term ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of demonstrators have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable states, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country as it spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Eyewitnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Distributed, video footage of the demonstrations, believed to be at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, shows how the security authorities beat young people with their fists while forcing them to stand against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from Western countries.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new business train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government oppression, the country’s opposition has been limited, and dissenters have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
“If you suppress people and they have no choice but to show their mind, this will happen,” Seyoum Teshome, a university professor from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole young person shows his mind.
One generation has shown it.
The complaints are diverse and cover the stigma of the ruling coalition’s power over land use.
After the much-critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies took the last place of the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are on the rise, and hundreds of people died in June during the battle along this tense and controversial border.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less overthrown in recent years, may try to exploit and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why after years of swaying beneath the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: the smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via hidden network intermediation servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups, the Oromans and the Amharas, are better able to cope with each other.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, succeeded in politics and business by exploiting rumors, many of which are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
“We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella,” said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amhars and Oromans believe that Ethiopia is ruled unfairly by the tiger people, covering about six per cent of the population and controlling the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly capable of detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
“The current administration does not have such a basic sense,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Northern Ethiopian tiger region, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the tiger-dominated security services don't trust him.
Many people fear that this may lead to increased bleeding.
The last time Ethiopia was in the grip of such a slump was in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about the elections, which analysts say seemed to be the government first looted and then looted them.
In the ensuing demonstration, many demonstrators died, albeit fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their visionary infrastructure design, such as a new business journey, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the intensification of the contempt of the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by tigers, and anti-tiger anger is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in the spotlight.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for aerial flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it said some time ago that it had closed this base.
While the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want the already unstable region's allies to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is real balancing."
Donald Trump Explains Obama-Based Isis Claims as 'Sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly denied this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee’s ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have surfaced to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they have to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
Following a suggestion made at the campaign meeting on Wednesday, Trump said the same more and more eagerly in interviews on Thursday, in which he said that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
In an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The announcement was a complete rendition from the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio broadcaster Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump clear his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign amid the economic downturn in opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the topic.
Back on Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he considered the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm in the past.
In late July, after he faced widespread criticism, apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to go to the limits of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where she's testing certain messages that are important to her fans. She's looking at how they work and then 'clearing' them in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the use of both candidates' language.
But I also think he is smart about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through a number of different lenses.
Instead of lightening his speeches for the general public, Trump has been more agile in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published Friday showed that Trump is stalking Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces an increasingly closer look during the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, made a lot of effort in defending the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I believe his words have real, political comments,” Giuliani said, when asked about the authenticity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which he called amateur, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he was pulling troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before meetings in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which are molested by his every word and are biased against him.
He ridiculed “bad, pitiful” television experts who try to get clear on him by saying “They can’t succeed!”
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s excuse as new evidence that he is unsuitable for president.
Previously Closed Cafe Returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a neat, cash-only place in Williamsburg where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the street corner on Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the latest loss in a middle-class city to be renovated.
Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is shattered and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinvention.
The revived Verb opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verbi has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same uncompromising atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café who is the owner and CEO of the new site.
He started in Verbi in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, had a lot of things in common.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try, too.
He brought in new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-hemp egg-cheese sausages, and the coatings include capers and browned onions, for example.
There's brown rice in the cabbage.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
Within nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old stock customers.
“Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers as well,” he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited Verbi regularly.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked into the cafeteria.
He says that after the closure of Verb, he gave up coffee for a moment.
“I understood that I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to a couple of coffees, although on that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been visiting Verbi faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
“Every day from fifteen to seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making spicy bagels with butter,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his regular order, but sometimes, due to variation, he places a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he won't take revenge on the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verbile, which would be used as an ingredient in the coffee shop’s cold-extracted coffee.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juicer wants to bottle and sell cold-dried coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough that they get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said she felt like she had come home walking in and ordering coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: sheep’s clothing
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office room.
As a treat, President Roosevelt liked refined Fifth Avenue foods, such as garlic pasta, and Maryland tomato pasta.
On that day, his diet was more modest: eggs filled with tomato sauce, potato sauce and plum plum dessert.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about the life of Lower East Side through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing their own culinary solidarity, they meet at the reporter’s dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a small, unfinished lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the stock market collapse of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive butter, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meat grinder, the couple found it appropriate to discuss eating the hamburger.
"The carrots were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut butter, liver butter, bean butter.
They were made from the material and some inexpensive ingredient, which continued the actual material.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make up your dinner.
Coe irvisti.
“It must have felt like lead in the stomach,” he said.
In the years before the slaughter of lambs at American tables, especially in the countryside, it was like eating-as-a-lot-as-a-week-a-week-a-week-a-week-a-week-a-week-a-day-a-week-a-day-a-day-a-days-a-days.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh cakes were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The book A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly no longer a land of satiety, but rather a land of starvation.
"Food then became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mysterious foods such as pancakes and boxes became the main foods, and the box was “a great way to use food stars,” said Ziegelman, as chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy saucepan.
The fresh fruit was replaced with less expensive dried fruits.
The meat, which had been at the center of American dishes for years, became a cost-effective luxury product.
Special compositions were tried when the amount of calories and nutrients were more important than the taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
In doing research, Ziegelman also prepared an age-old dish for a book containing recipes, where roasted onions were filled with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dining table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman clarified, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for roasted onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
Recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to start becoming "budgetaries" and to respond to the challenge of converting sautéed spaghetti and carrot-like snacks into tasty servings.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical tastings.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover let me eat cake.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood for simple, Ivorian country food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
“He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate a smoke in the almost golden dining room.
He was great outside of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only Washington's most expensive, but also the most unfortunately prepared food."
Many of the Lamanite dining options were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she was unable to throw food away.
“He was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a windshield accident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe brought out the dessert they had prepared at home: a dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called slurry foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the general trick was to give modest recipes a name that looks like.
There was no creamy foam in the dessert, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They all submerged their spoons unwittingly in a sticky, brown lizard.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sneezed once and for all.
Sounding from a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of crushed walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for attorney’s fees in the patent battle against Merck
A U.S. filing judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to the attorney’s fees incurred by it in a dispute over a hepatitis C patient against pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from payments of $200 million after they violated two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, which followed when a U.S. judge found out about Merck's misconduct and other misconduct, which included a false oath.
In Thursday’s verdict, U.S. fiancee Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation it received in opposing the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can significantly improve more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other for the ownership of Gilead’s drug active substance, sofosbuvir-based laboratory work.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely conquered ISIS-held Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have completely captured the northern city of Manbij, close to the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a group representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by fighters as prisoners, from the allied forces of the Sharfan Darwish SDF, from the Military Council of Manbij, told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband’s income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced he had received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster in his career book.
Clinton’s vice president candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, released a 10-year tax return.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting the benchmark for economic transparency,” Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration’s audit as a reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"It's your turn," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business operations, and numerous other examples of ties.
Clinton has caught up with the problem on Friday in an online video that featured prominent Republicans calling on Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last decades has done: publish his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has paid no or very little taxes in the two of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist lent on Friday a number of taxpayers and accountants who said the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax cuts have become a problem in the presidential election.
According to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Clinton has backed a rule that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also running a tax administration audit, and that Trump "fears" not the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from salaries, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an inexpensive index-bound investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and bats improve elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent elephants from wandering into human habitations - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The tool has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea several years ago, together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of Northern Tanzania to use the non-violent, non-violent four-step approach to clean homes.
In the past, many people used spiders to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we have seen a change in attitudes in these communities. They are now much more confident about being able to keep elephants off their fields without harming them," Honeyguy CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing the intrusive elephant with a flashlight and ringing the turret.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called "chill cloud" is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and sparkling, after which the condom is turned on so that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When the condom is ignited, it bursts into flames and explodes chili powder into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
As a last resort, a firefighter will shoot a Roman candle in the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticises Berlin hotel, which removed Israel’s address number at Arab request
A French filmmaker with a Jewish background admitted to a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's reference number, according to the employee, due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country's address number list offered by the hotel in Israel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker addressed the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response received there "disturbed him".
The hotel's receptionist said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
"Most of our visitors are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's landline number," Lanzmann said.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a major wrongdoing,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
“We were shocked and appalled by the incident.
This in itself is a great injustice.
But even more shameful is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
There's no need for explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gave up" on the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Wake up," another publication said, noting that the hotel on the stunning Kurfurstendamm street is located near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly disputed all charges and called the incident "indiscretion" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“A tough order not to include Israel on the shortlist has never been made,” Kempinski’s representative told Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the reference number has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber bands against Brazilian students who showed their mind.
On Thursday, students joined police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo as students gathered to demonstrate their minds against reforms to the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bands against the protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the student crowd, which led to the police using rubber bands and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express the horror of the plans.
Sao Paulo Gov. Paulo Geraldo Alckmin suggested that less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after demonstrators set off as a troop to support detainee President Dilma Rousseff in the country’s Senate vote on his charge of office.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is growing by 71%
After the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says Levan Dzhagaryan, the Russian ambassador to Iran.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, Russian companies have shown a large degree of interest in business operations in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies will continue their existing ties to Iran, while new ones will be ready to enter the market.
“Of course, one of the main goals of Iran’s two-way cooperation is to expand trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
"Trade growth was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office in Iran granted about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also one of the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia for the first time.
“It is safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, very few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotland's Callum Skinner hits the target when the British hit a bicycle gold
Scotland’s Callum Skinner contested his honour at the men’s team print at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night when three of Britain’s teams defended their 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role where his Scottish counterpart Sir Chris Roy recovered, a legend that was proud of his youth when he scored a goal for the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic goals.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing for the 6th of March at the World Championships in London, although Hoy has since ended his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of special envoy Jamie Staff.
This was achieved just in time when Hindes appeared.
The cessation of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man whom the British coaches had captured in Scotland with respect to the potential that has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindes was exactly behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes' drive on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to hold the triggers.
Hoy followed up with his position as an expert on the BBC, drawing the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the awards roster.
The 23-year-old Glasgow-based Skinner said, "The comparison is stunning."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable at one time.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his remarks, and Britain’s rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the victory.
Hindes said: “It felt like I had been in London when there were so many British flags on foot.”
As a team, we have made contact over the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven of the ten cycling races in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny’s condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s feat, winning three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that’s a visible holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave’s, Mo Farah’s, and Roger Bannister’s birthday) – would total to six gold medals.
It would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny is next to compete in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just enjoyed this one.
Team racing is always the best.
It will be won together with friends.
“Winning alone is, frankly, lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of a knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest four-person, four-kilometre-long teams in time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record for gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will surely be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before time, when officials called him for a length measurement.
In a similar women’s race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavien advanced in world record time at a time of 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole set of medals.
Having presented in Beijing and London with truly exceptional and complete control, expectations have been lowered before the Rio races.
There have been dramas, the smallest of which have not been the break-up of technical director Shane Sutton in April for reasons of sexism and temptation, and the end of the competition of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation to rise to its peak at the perfect moment could once again be true.
The future of the Portland meltdown is questionable due to the cut of the electricity contract
The future of Portland’s Victorian aluminium smelting, as well as hundreds of jobs, is uncertain when the electricity distribution company at the plant revealed that one of the plant owners is concluding a distribution contract, so it is expected to cut all distribution contracts.
The measure follows the Victorian administration’s decision earlier this year not to extend the aid required for the operation of the plant.
The 20-year subsidy period expires in November.
As many as 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown, which led to the closure of the English power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland meltdown is losing money and under lockdown.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the factory production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter at its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is also waiting for three other owners to decide on its contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the physical electricity demand for smelting will continue,” it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" that were to come into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they actually expire in 2017.
“For this reason, AGL expects the results of the contracts to be produced in the 2017 financial year,” the electricity company said.
All possible impacts on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong prospects of the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already “predicted the termination” to reduce the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep smelting in operation or secure smelting electricity supply".
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the deal was due to come into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary of both the melting pot in Portland, Victoria, and also the possible closure of the Tomag plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, chief operating officer of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both factories leave the market, it will be a significant reduction in the demand of the [electricity] market.
As a producer of electricity, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian real-tv star, is on the cover of Vogue in September
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's clan, is on the cover of the US Vogue's wanted September issue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and model for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a unique (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?) scripted reality video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and which was accompanied by a group of his favorite entertainers, Keeping Upan’s producer R.
This is the cliché of the "birthday period" of almost every children's television series (Seacrest states the alternate words "you probably thought we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-painted puppet), but Krisin had to get her other girls to somehow benefit from this remake
This is because we have certainly moved into a new Kardashian era with the location of Vogue in September.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached Vogue's suit first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite of its own class.
The September issue of Voguen is the best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more reminiscent of a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that from last year’s 832-page lesson, there were 615 advertising content).
Its star is so eagerly awaited to be revealed that during the last two years, images from the magazine have leaked before official publication.
Former women included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrities who act as models" than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior’s ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga’s place of honor.
But if it happens that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "success model" of his generation, hits that category first, he's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or modern-day young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner has all of this).
They are, of course, talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model Beyoncé has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
In his true TV story, Jenner’s role in the fashion world will always be a thorny one.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid for calling them "the mother of the moment".
This feeling came back to the surface with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Voguen's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own, paywall-backed apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids, she's a real TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160,000 people away every year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are deported from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares itself for the effects of additional financial cuts on its already-financed activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair regulations and the like – are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and legal advice.
Legal services already extended to the Community's frontiers are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
The head of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, James Farrell, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not revoked, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s community legal centers are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with unmanageable and crippling debts, families living in a house, workers who have been unfairly separated - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of unprotected Queenslanders will be forced to navigate amid complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on both the Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to cancel these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made a commitment to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community's legal centre and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign has been challenged after the employee was alleged to have been threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged for allegedly doing nothing after they were told that the campaign’s North Carolina chief threatened a gunman in February while driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by former software practitioner Vincent Bordin of the state campaign in a Charlotte state courthouse.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "raised the pistol, placed his right forearm on the vest and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knee lamp," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After being elected to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"Weapons don't need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee angered the public in North Carolina when he told the "second-income people" - who are usually seen as gun owners and gunmen - could take action on the Clifford and the elector of his rival Hill.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he did not support violence.
The Bordin challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent control, and from Phillip for violence, abuse, and emotional distress.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, reports that Phillip left the campaign recently.
His call to Innovative Consulting Services for his consulting firm was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.

Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity all over the world, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow’s great charm, just like it was the charm of the London 2012 races, when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the races.
The Olympians had huge benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we're doing it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
Just like before the London 2012 races, some will come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question it is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have an amazing team at Heathrow that has implemented an infrastructure investment program of <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion in time and budget, from the T5, which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2, which was built on the world’s two busiest interstates.
Now the team is ready to implement the third Thanksgiving track, supported by 16 billion pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that Heathrow’s expansion is also that.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade, and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former Secretary of Commerce at the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in Cat and Mouse games to block ads
For companies that earn money from online advertising, the attempts to bypass the ad-blocking program are “in-and-mouse games,” said one of the companies making such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its computer-accessible pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the program’s filters to prevent ads from coming back on social networking pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code for its web pages will be changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to see which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circumventing the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that “such a back-and-forth struggle between the open-source ad-blocking community and its circles has been going on since ad-blocking was invented,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much sadness the ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company is behind the blockers of pages used on the computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads are still generating enough revenue to make Facebook consider an investment of this kind to be worthwhile.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ads preferences” tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to tackle the problem,” a Facebook representative said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman left under car on Swiss highway apparently for suicide <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman left on the highway in the early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently suicide.
The accident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and sat down in the dark to lie down on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who was clearly trying to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have been identified, police said, calling on them and all eyewitnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
“But it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved can be charged.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - where both had a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that drivers could not wait to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of charges of negligence over the production of death due to his hit and murder of a man lying on the A! road near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and had been thrown off the road, the court told.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, drove in a justified manner and that the man’s presence on the road had “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out whether the hot, anhydrous surface and carbon dioxide filling on Venus could at times have been earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow speed of rotation of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and still could have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had drier regions of the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic variation to allow life and protect it from the rapid evaporation of water.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30% darker than the sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its half-day sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and generates rain, creating a thick cloud layer that acts as a umbrella protecting the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth’s current.
The model produced a story about Venus’s evolutionary stages, which is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably once habitable, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena — the Venus we know today — remained.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the publication Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche coach's pestilence
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the actions of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of ice hockey as the reason for the team’s lack of influence in the decision-making process.
Colorado Deputy CEO/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the information and said the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I've done my duty as Colorado Avalanche's vice president and head coach of hockey with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I have been thinking for a long time and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to the higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and vice president of ice hockey must be fully in line with the view of the organization.
He must also have the ability to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Royta for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League in his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a victory in the central division, but Minnesota dropped Colorado in the first round of the drop games, and the team has not been able to progress in the last two years.
The Avalanche games in the 2015–16 season ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing to the Western Conference wild card dropping site.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups – two at both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Continue Negotiations and Delay Strikes
Work battles for oil workers in the North Sea over wages will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the top negotiators said.
The strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged randomly by Royal Dutch Shell on drilling ferries in the North Sea.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute,” the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent labor struggle, which they say is the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, the Wood Group cut the premiums for North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s premium reduction follows a 10% reduction in its contractors in countries from 2014.
The company said that the additional cuts would provide the company with the necessary space to cope with the declining pace of the market.
Shell, in turn, has cut thousands of people’s salaries and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company eases operations as a result of its massive merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with coalition leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labor disputes of a generation in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential for the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average for the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete list of the rotational speeds of the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the star cluster rotates at varying speeds, as well as how orbits are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age, and even its solar system history," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of these stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're running at their peak now.
At its velocity of rotation, these adult stars throw large amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of detectable star flashes, such as solar flares.
The list of rotational velocities of the last stars suggests that the more massive stars rotate slower than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with larger ones making puzzles slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' ballet, we see that slower wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian constellation is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why and why the stars are slowing down their rotational speed and so to speak, hanging their 'dancing shoes' on their nails.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational speeds in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
