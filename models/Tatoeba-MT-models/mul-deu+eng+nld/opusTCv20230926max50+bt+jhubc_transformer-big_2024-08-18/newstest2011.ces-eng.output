What does he do? <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort nor the sugar shop
The new mayors of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD mayor will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order for them to understand their old-fashioned colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representative office.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz members of the new board of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD "tested", as they know, the notorically introduced slang, which was created in the town hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political creammaker during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and causas in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors do not understand much of the familiar concepts.
At least he says so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a beginner in Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> responded to the test of the "Kmotrov" dictionary of the Council for Culture.
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Councilman Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted in the same way.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you present to me that I use sometimes."
"Otherwise, I don't recognize the slang in general."
From the dictionary, the journal Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriety-related to the Prague magistracy.
The Socialists had to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf cave in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "beast necks", "the betrayal of the capital" and "adult".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who is to head Prague's education in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek immediately refused the test.
"I don't solve these things at all, and I won't judge the way the civil democrats are doing."
"I am now deciding how we will understand each other within our programs," he said.
As it has already been said, the headline above, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, would allegedly not recognize that it is an influential entrepreneur and a friend of the expressionist Bém Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>kov.
"Voldemort" does not tell Kaucké anything and the only term he correctly estimated in the rehearsal is "the largest golf cave in Prague".
"It's the Blank Tunnel," Kaucky says, and immediately adds, "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole as a Blanka tunnel is not only deciphered by Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina’s matador, but also by Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>, an environmental councilor.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukash Plachem knows where to find this character - he knows the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague company," Pech<0xC3><0xBD> is close to dissolving that it is the headquarters of the Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k companies.
According to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he recalls that knowledge was derived from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In a social democracy, according to the test frequency, there is no such runaway dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've had a meeting with my colleagues, too, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
“We call ourselves names, sometimes names are used for abbreviations and nicknames,” says Petr Hulinsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the president of the Czech SSR in Prague, who is nicknamed Hulda.
“I was called B<0xC5><0x99>ez at school, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” admits Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Di<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz name has tried and works.
For the supporters of Grandpa or less friendly Grandpa, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned himself of fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has the nickname "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" in some colleagues.
Surnames are also the only thing that social democrats allow in their domestic language.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> says Hulda does not like it, but the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Injury Law" recalls that Petr Hulinsky earned his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to curb torture of “witches,” published the brochure
Women declared to be witches in Burkina Faso have several common characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, cannot get involved in work, for example, for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"A man's fate reaches very seldom."
“Young healthy women are also not deterred because they help at work and give birth to children,” says a nurse who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house that their communities have expelled from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She published an information booklet that should help the witch hunt be limited.
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of Burkina Faso's adults cannot read," noted the paper's Die Standard.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, which is next door to Burkina Faso, twenty-seven-year-old Amma Hemmah died last week after being tortured, oiled and burned by three women and two men.
The BBC reported the case.
The smugglers claim that this was an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances.
According to their version, an oil was ignited on the woman, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said he got up after the group wanted to "eject an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of “witches” is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted the forty-two-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying, “The sparks of human souls have always been a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to pacify the hunt for witches, the president himself took part in Gambia last year.
"After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammy launched a massive hunt for witches who were supposed to be involved in her death and attempt to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
“He called for help from shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president’s personal protection, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president’s farm in Kanila,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, incarcerated people had to drink herbal liquor with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two inmates on the farm did not survive.
After international pressure, almost a thousand inmates were finally released from prison.
Bakal's tenant: He's melting in the stones, higher rent signed
An elderly subordinate man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG Byty "uhlobarona" Zdenek Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried the file and in it a new lease to three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in the execution of the sentence.
All three of the deregulation just raised the rent.
Instead of 3500 monthly, the son will pay for the 2<0x2B>1 second category apartment from next year 4100 kroner.
"And there is no hot water and the petrama must melt," the man points with his finger in his son's new contract, on which he has full power.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until December 7, when they will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waved his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he mutters.
Ostrava is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments in the Czech Republic still have non-market rentals.
This is why we decided to visit the “laboratory” in person.
The Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov RPG waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at 9am.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a trigger.
"Rent 2011", a special button on its touch screen lights up.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already popping up on the big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're on your way.
After a while, the older couple comes to ask about the rental, but the naval in the waiting room obviously does not concern new rentals at all.
Most people have come to deal with common problems like any other - requests for repairs, insurance events, and so on.
Letters with new leases are sent to the mailboxes in Ostrava by the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio from approximately mid-November.
RPG Byty in their letters proposes an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special section for new rentals was opened at the client center on November 18th.
“It’s running for over a week, so it’s only in the run,” the employee responds after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, he was taken quite haphazardly by the vice-president of the parliament and the Ostrava native Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek from the Czech Republic, and even now he is full of local newspapers.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even replaced me with a plaque in the bathroom," said the man mentioned in the introduction.
The most so far, according to the employees, the pensioners come to see if they get a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as the RPG in the special offer promises them.
Half discount on the February lease will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov's "regulatory" barrier, but the questions are certainly not numbered.
“Of yesterday’s 360 clients, there were only about forty to fifty people here because of the 2011 lease,” the employees estimate.
The RPG on the website and its boards proposes individual negotiation of contracts where it is needed.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal proceeding," the RPG said in a statement.
"No one will be judged here," one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks, and the man on the street in front of the client center partly gives her the truth.
“I have 13,000 pensions and I have five thousand to eat, I don’t have to judge myself,” he says.
In the end, however, the workers will be dismayed.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he says.
The regulation of rentals ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing lease still does not reach even the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the tenant's angry tenant's negligence of the housing fund, according to the owner.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, rental RPGs could invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling in front of the padded seats of the Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room thus far repeats several red highlights.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less relates to 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most about 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," it appears on the screen.
For only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio, rent rises by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," notes RPG.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not release rents jumping, but will be distributed over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) will give the company back to the apartments, mainly to the thermal savings - new windows and heating.
Preferably, they should be given to people who will sign an agreement to increase rents.
Offices include a kindergarten, understood by the architects
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to also hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of employees of Arch.Design can visit it.
The architectural and design company Arch.Design, from whose studios came a number of important buildings in Brno, has been counting on space for its company mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of a baby boomer, and it was important for women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of shortened appointments, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with childcare.
The mini-school was invented by the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (a grant of CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and ensure qualified personnel and operations for two years.
After the financial subsidy is exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design has an obligation to operate a mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the application for the grant was significantly assisted by Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the nurse and the teacher of the school nurses take care of the children all day, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "mini-schooler", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day they are replaced by more.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program filling in a mini-school is comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and get rid of stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents are making more productive use of their working hours.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship here.
Arch.Design has thus joined the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house from the bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into the interiors of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the backbone of an ancient lizard, the staircase reminiscent of the dinosaur's spine and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> house in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
From the locals, the house, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, cracks of roofs and mosaics, a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of shells and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s secession.
The front of the house plays dream lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
With detailed observation, geometry, rhythm and a well-thought-out order can be seen.
At night, the whole fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of colors is even strengthened.
Wrapping and twisting of shapes appear to the same extent in the interiors.
Wood in the waves copies window frames, curtains, decorative elements of the door, dolls and bars.
The Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House, which stands in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia <0x23>43, was created by the reconstruction of the house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The factory Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> himself.
It was co-operated by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on its design plate that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaic on the facade were created.
A number of other artists and artists worked on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> started the successful collaboration of Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s house Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and Güell Park, in which are other works of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others called it a "singing house" because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows.
It is also said that on the top of the building is likened to the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed the house for his time a unique central heating system with vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree inclination.
In Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s creation, he absolutely did not respect the construction regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city council was devastated and requested a correction.
For example, the council’s fault was that the building also touched the pillars into the public sidewalk.
The repair never occurred, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the challenge of the urban area, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> applied for (and successfully obtained) a permit to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social lounge and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The land was rented by jewellery.
The entire six-storey house crosses a staircase, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the living room doors, and a larger company can communicate comfortably together without at the same time maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction also received an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play is also impressive with light, blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is lined, and light bulbs.
The game of two colors delivers maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and honorable apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The tours continued, as they found it to be a very advantageous business, and in addition, they expanded the tours by common and attic areas, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is certainly not negligible, it amounts to 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum far exceeds the price of entry to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of a house with dragon towers, you need to quickly make friends with some of the residents of the village and visit it right at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grill: women have different requirements than men
Not a cozy frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying area, i.e. the mattress and the grill, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, it must be complemented harmoniously to suit a particular user.
When choosing, it decides a lot of things, from the weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior into which the mattresses and grills are taken.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages, where they do not melt regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them on a regular basis.
Because if they do not have a lot of ventilation ducts in the core, and they are still lying on the hard disk, they retain moisture: mold could also appear under them.
It is also customary to choose.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and with a hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they weren't going to sleep here."
"On their severed shoulders, heels, and hips, they needed mattresses softening with a layer of linen foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they are poorly absorbing 'information' from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, but also for other customers, this is why many years ago, the linen foam mattress was scanned.
"Today it's fine, the right mattress is Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate the woolen foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, at night you won't turn around like after a tough game.
You'll just sleep better.
Linen foam also acts as a protection against debris.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height add another length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, i.e. a total of 180 cm.
For separate beds, for example, for singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For convenience and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back you should have your hands comfortably slightly folded in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, chechmistryryna Chechu pillows and decorators, who deals with the issues of healthy sleep and ergonomics of the school years in front of the furniture.
For a double bed, each needs its own grill and mattress, but here be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing but mounting grills at different heights, however, you may not succeed at every frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the forming and chipping layer.
"When you touch your hands or touch the mattress, you must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grill.
The full-sized beds, where the mattresses and the basement are like slender Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, they cannot be washed off, which is already common today.
And because we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters per night, it’s clear that after five to seven years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) mesh.
That’s why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its butts.
Therefore, advice from dealers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work do not give up a detectable coating, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress coverings are commonly produced today, they are scratched all over the circuit, so after the disassembly we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), yet the handling of larger types (and with one person) in the rig could be reminiscent of a rig.
Do you have a hard disk in your bed instead of a grill?
Never, ever!
Maximum on a bed intended for visits for one night.
However, cover the board (if it no longer has) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in the bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and a cypress layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a basis.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-fitting lamella grilles with 14 to 18 lamellas, but you will always pay for the grilles with more lamellas, 28 and more, where the lamellas in the area of the thighs are doubled and it is possible to do so.
On the positioning lamella grilles do not belong mattresses with spring skeleton, because they do not respond to the positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, a so-called shoulder strap can be provided.
It is a special fastening of the lamella, which allows you to press or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder of the sleeper is nicely "tightened".
For men who have "arms across the entire back", definitely an important thing.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses already remember it, who in the "women's" began to use the softening zone precisely in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most demanding customers, wing or plate grilles with so-called multitorsional suspension are designed.
The pressure is broken down into several points and the voltage is reduced.
However, be careful, once you apply to the right mattress and grill the wrong pillow (large and "stuffed"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and intervene with the tips only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be relaxed.
A suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should align (along with a shoulder pad grille or a softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original strawberries filled with grass.
In fact, their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures.
The trend is also in mattresses.
Raw materials from the oil from which polyurethane foams are produced are replaced by natural oils, for example from soybeans and soybeans.
It is the soybean that is used by all known manufacturers.
“Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of purely natural material,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also add microcapsules to give you a fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man "cools" the plant extract from the birch to absorb heat and cool the body, the woman "melts" the coating.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer for the weaker sex.
Today's favorites?
The mattress is made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cell structure, so it is more breathable than ordinary polyurethane and also offers better elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foam and "line" foams produce multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, thighs and heels should be.
For a quality mattress, you will pay from 7,000 kroner and above.
Those who meet the health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as health aids.
He was the first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage Gumotex.
Saving on the mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes, for example, you can take advantage of the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers a Duofreeze mattress with memory foam in the cover for 11,990 kroner.
The second one can already be purchased for free.
The era of woolen or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density was initiated by the "cosmic" Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, because at launch the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
The temperature in the heat softens, and in the cold, on the contrary, solidifies.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedding, but also for increasing comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which relieve the legs and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
People's Watching Devices Want More and More Parents, So They Want to Watch Their Children
Fear of owning a child is driving more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system originally created to search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The appliance is still as big as a box of sirens, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A lot of people scared the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to ask for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about any espionage, but another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of monitoring equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case, such devices can be abused, for example, when they are put in a bag to someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't encountered such a case yet."
"Mostly it's really customers buying it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" is used and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if the child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to intentionally lose things when they don’t want to be under control.”
“High expectations were raised earlier by parents of mobile phones, but they can be turned off as well as these tracking devices,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It is also disputed whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as prepared kidnapping is concerned, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child does not have any electronics to reveal his or her location."
"It's a phone now."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will be looking for them, because their sales will certainly be backed by massive advertising."
“In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
He admits, however, that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden pedophile attack.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even in the event of an immediate destruction of the tracking device after the attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to send the position on a regular basis after a certain period of time has expired."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive devices also have inclinometers built-in, so even if a person just slides and stays still, the device will immediately send a warning with the setting of the position," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
According to him, a similar service can also be carried out by smartphones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are either appliances similar to the size of a box of sirens or smaller mobile phones.
That's how they're always in danger of losing.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like regular digital watches are now being tested.
"This will have the greatest advantage in the fact that a potential aggressor may not know the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll know them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking devices develop into bracelets or trailers, they will still use the same technology that is used to monitor cars.
It’s a combination of location detection using a GPS system (which uses normal autonavigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has ignition cords to encircle the Czech Republic. But it will only last two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of rope that fires the trenches.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of rope to the warehouses.
The army has a stock for 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the rope is two, a maximum of four years.
The military bought fire cords from STV Group, a.s. for 40 million kroner.
The general staff, justifying the purchase of such a huge number of ignition cords, wrote down that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of ignition during training per year.
However, from the calculations of military pyrotechnics addressed by MF DNES, it follows that all generals, army officers, secretaries or cleaners would then have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondru and army commander Vlastimil Pick are no exceptions.
Only in this way can the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of firefighters be justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, for the basic training of each new professional, a maximum of two meters of ignition cord is sufficient, as experts say, the army has secured a fresh purchase - even with the increased consumption of 22 jerseys or special units - of supplies.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra personally that they have almost no ammunition in their handguns, so the shootings are also limited due to the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't think they buy so many fireplaces from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision and they certainly know what it's going to be for."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to meet," says STV Group business manager Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek justifies the hundreds of kilometers of purchased ropes and the fact that the army will have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from STV Group speaks only about the four-year life of a fire extinguisher and police or military pyrotechnics even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it could be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to disclose his name because of criticism from the army.
After life is over, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not threaten soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a mass discount on 445 kilometers of ignition cords.
"It cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of firing cords of police pyrotechnics, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police are always ordering only such quantities to consume this ammunition before the end of life.
This has been proven for the safety of pyrotechnics, and can also more flexibly obtain more modern, and therefore more reliable types of strings.
The Ministry of Defense is already in serious trouble with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the twentieth-thousandth Czechoslovak army was preparing to march to the Rhine.
According to the Czech pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, the same problem awaits in a few years: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old fireplaces, which today "lacino" buys.
To this day I draw from the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the <0xC5><0xBD>ivnostn<0xC3><0xAD>k of the Year competition helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytlounov to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year’s <0xC5><0xBD>ivnostn<0xC3><0xAD>k of the year competition was the twenty-eight-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and through bank loans, he bought a semi-detached house with five apartments.
The fact that he was still a third-year student at the university at the time was a great deal of courage.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation at our place did not allow me to try to do anything about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first refurbished apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
All the profits were invested back in a house, which he gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, after seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was the recently four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, he added another one of the same quality.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov near Tisé, where we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties about the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting,” says the number one retailer last year.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel has been a big part of the victory in the Lifeguard of the Year competition," Pytloun adds.
The victory brought him more fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the streets, often congratulating me extra and I have to say it was nice,” he recalls.
Participation in the competition definitely recommends to anyone who is trying something.
You don’t have to win, every vision is good.
He says he still draws from contacts and acquaintances that he might not have come to any other way.
"I started trading regularly with some of the people I met because of the competition."
The glory associated with success, according to him, fell a little on every employee.
And that he's about 70.
“I see greater loyalty and pride in them for participating in something that has gained general recognition,” he said.
“It’s not just my personal success, it’s the result of good work for all of us together.”
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory quickly replaced the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the target awareness of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind him.
For the prize for the first place in last year’s Vodafone Company competition, last year the owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, arrived in the Slovak House.
The jury then appreciated the effort through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small tool shop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalic.
“I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but all of my colleagues and increased our confidence in the competition,” he said.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karl <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the Communists seized property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father founded a company on plastic bathtubs.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the unprofessional public after its success in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were working with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, last year in Farmet was not just a sign of euphoria from victory.
The award was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of mechanical goods.
It culminated in a crisis that hadn’t touched so many citizens yet, but companies had already stopped their investment projects and started limiting purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, has not been avoided by us either."
"We had to limit production by 40 percent and there was a layoff," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit less than before the crisis.
However, what they have not come up with in Farmet is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training center from the grants, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we have won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It all shows that the crisis is behind them.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is the fourth part of the business crunch.
Some pointless regulations have already been repealed.
The unfamiliar winner of the next year’s poll Absurdita of the year has become the obligation to carry to the office documents, which are also accessible to officials online.
It was decided by more than a third of the less than 4,000 voters.
For example, social security management required a paper excerpt from the business register, although an official can get it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, this will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an excerpt from the commercial register for checks on insured persons," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
To shine a light on all the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and those nonsense to cancel is the meaning of the contest Absurdity of the Year.
This is already the fourth part of an entrepreneurial rally organized by the Economic Newspapers this year and the public is enjoying increasing popularity.
If last year's vote was attended by about three thousand voters, this year there were almost four thousand.
And it’s no wonder that there are plenty of different legal obligations that serve only to keep the business going, and there are still plenty of them.
"Perhaps in the number of lists for tax recognition we are at the leading places in the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, business simplification has become the declared goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
Every year from April to the end of September, when the competition closes, anyone can register administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. The organizer of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote on it through the Internet during October on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year’s survey included more than one hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations that lacked meaning.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there was a requirement for motorway and highway maintenance vehicles to pay tolls, or for entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the competition’s website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted in this competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws entrepreneurs underfoot, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs each year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business,” said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Attempts to disrupt nonsensical regulations are not in vain.
In 2007, most people were challenged by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the booth to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation has been abolished by the new Business Act.
The second-most-voted obligation in 2007, which was the notification of the employment office for its foreign employee's journey of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And a third of all good things.
In 2009, it became absurd for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two loose weights in the office.
This was mitigated this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator dropped.
The new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
A novelty in this year’s fifth year of the Contest of Economic Newspapers is the category called Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“This is how we want to support companies that take into account their business’ environmental impacts and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the competition.
For the first year of this special sub-category of the Vodafone Firma main competition of 2010, companies for which success in the business is not the only long-term goal applied.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish on a separate article.
Although the subject matter of their activities differs diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as the common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists across the republic was the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the foundation fund sponsoring children with disabilities for seventeen years.
The paper company from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, which has more than 70 percent of its disabled employees, has been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and the Vodafone Company of the Year was ranked third in the region.
In Olomouck, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prefers to buy from Czech producers, promotes civic activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
“We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administrations have the least impact on the environment,” explains Milus Ryznarova.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region again thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local guard.
"In addition, we support the Human in distress Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Washing and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their pension insurance to its employees in the form of superstandard bonuses.
"We are again contributing to nutrition, transport, qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> from the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category Responsible Firm of the Year, all the short finalists of the Vodafone Firm of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions in the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly filled in or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Firma of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to register for this competition alone, as it is a sub-category of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested in public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police arrested in recent days.
The <0xC5><0xBD>el<0xC3><0xAD>zka detectives deployed a local entrepreneur in the media sphere and a real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
The latter allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public tender in order to settle the claims for restitution in such a way that the land offered in the tender was acquired by a particular interested party.
He had to pay half a million kroner for it.
"For now, I can only confirm that the police are suing one person for the violation of the fur during the public procurement and during the public competition," Pilsen State Prosecutor General Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1> told Pilsen Law, with the fact that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be investigated.
The forty-six-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
In view of the minimum official information, it is possible to speculate on how the public competition might have influenced it.
A spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Pr<0xC3><0xA1>va said that police officers were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
"It was about a client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public competition has the correct title "Call to submit a tender for land transfer entitlements under the Law on Land" and is held in the event that more eligible applicants are interested in the offered land.
"These persons as part of the challenge offer a higher value of their claims for restitution to be settled by transfer than the value of the land has been declared."
"According to the proposed claims, the order of the acquirers will be determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information about who applied for the call, and since he himself was also an eligible person, since he had purchased a number of refund claims, he offered the land to the interested party that he would not participate in the competition.
I think he's got a resignation for it.
That would explain that he had such a large amount of money in custody.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had superstandard contacts with PF in Pilsen in the past.
He appeared in the case of former PF chief V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing land on which the decision on the location of the building had already been issued in the replacement restitution.
It was then that Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public transport, specifically in the place where the entrance to the industrial zone of Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> Pole was to be built.
Later it was very conveniently exchanged with a magistrate for a house in the historical center of the city itself, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to join, because otherwise blocking the land would endanger the building.
Households will pay hundreds per month for housing
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and storage, heat supplies and rents will grow somewhere.
Families will have to withdraw hundreds of crowns a month more from their wallets from January than now.
Electricity costs up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, and in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and in many cases also underestimate the supply of central heat.
Electricity bills in homes are expected to lose hundreds of pounds more annually than they do now.
Power prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, and therefore there is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
While gas costs slightly, of course at a time when people melt the most and thus have the highest consumption.
Each year, they also have to count on hundreds of extra crowns.
While electricity and gas are costing throughout the republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay an additional 50 kroner per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kroner per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, again, are threatened by more than 9% of the cost of water and sewage, in case the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the rent will add 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower ones in the whole republic.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and stock prices are expected to decrease by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices can rise significantly in 450,000 rental apartments, where the regulation ends from January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who will not agree to the new rent, intend to put the company in court.
Regulated rents paid by people in about 300,000 homes could increase by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which the drink most often ends in the care of doctors drunk, who were not even fifteen years old.
There are no exceptions for children who are treated repeatedly in hospital from a monkey.
This is due to the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the incomes of children’s hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk.”
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Prava the primary of the children's department of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"If they manage to pull Daddy's bottle out of the closet, it's about whiskey, but otherwise, it's a farnet and vodka."
"The lead has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and not feeling so much," the mayor explained.
And for the truth, the spokesperson of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> gives him.
"It's usually a farnet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a plum that they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to the Mayor of Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drunks on hospital admission are a fairly common phenomenon.
In front of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been active since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motole, where ambulances connect subjugated students from a wide range.
"There was a girl at our house about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with an extra 3.5 promille of blood alcohol combined with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance parties."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the prime minister said.
Parents’ disinterest or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing child intoxication.
However, in the true sense of the word, dependence cannot be talked about in children, according to experts.
“The term ‘alcoholic’ refers to several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and that is not the case with children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, there is a rather symptomatic unspecified family-social background,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n explained.
According to a spokesperson, Jurin was hospitalized at a pediatric clinic in Motole until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will be included in the statistics.
Children's drunks who take their parents home after outpatient treatment, or if they are taken home by the police, do not count in any way.
In addition to the cases where children just sit after school and drink a bottle of squirrels, according to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: the witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They're either drinking it out of bad testimony, or they're celebrating the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course, I have experienced the witch at the reception of seven child drunkards at once," Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n said.
A drinker who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically advantageous compared to someone who suffers from an unpleasant kitten at home the next day.
The early headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency triggers an initial infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
“They’re actually better at it because after that beautiful evening experience they have a good awakening and nothing hurts them.”
"There's only confusion about where they are," Pelikan admitted, sometimes destroying the pleasant mood of patients, at least by calculating the cost of their treatment.
The transfer of an ambulance and hospitalization to an emergency bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated directly to the children on the visit, how much their intoxication costed and that they could also spend the entire summer in the brigade to make money for that one party," Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not have access to regression procedures, in which the costs of treatment would be met after the parents, in the cases of child drunken.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s from a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been in practice or show years.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was previously operated by the Czech Army and which was able to fly.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
These are currently conserved in the Air Waterways and the trade intermediary - the company Omnipol - has already taken over last week.
When the planes are physically ejected from the Vodochod, according to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ka of the Defense Press Department, it is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the exchange have been decommissioned from long-range aircraft without further deposits and investment by the Ministry's resort."
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been changed in its current state and form," Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vu Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seat aircraft, as the Ministry signed a 200-million-crown contract with Aere Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four unnecessary L-159s into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ka, EADS has pledged to deploy the aircraft in the armaments of some of the Allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft are being purchased by EADS and will be used to train NATO pilots.”
"It is therefore a matter of the customer how this thing will be implemented," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Economic Newspaper reported earlier that the Spanish army, for example, had no interest in the L-159.
The government approved the replacement of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more for CZK 3.5 billion last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not outline the procurement procedure and contacted EADS directly.
The then-defense leadership argued that the exchange would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably also have a court dowry.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice for selecting aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last to arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport within fourteen days.
A Longer Indicator Than a Finger Signifies a Lower Risk of Cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than their fingertips are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60 years of age,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially when combined with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles said.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK monitored more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and more than 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the study participants had a pointer on their right hand shorter than a ring.
She paid for them the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
For those who had a pointer longer than a finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and for men in their 60s, it even decreased by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes the growth of prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es for the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said that he knows about this study, but he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks is usually snowy, motorists in many places have been driving all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed there on the 91st kilometer, two trucks crashed on the 93th kilometer, and the accident caused injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the excavation.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway on the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers should descend just behind Brno on the 190th kilometer or drive across Brno and then drive on the 182th kilometer on K<0xC3><0xBD>valca.
Several kilometers of columns are formed there.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague there is a layer of snow several centimeters, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created, for example, on Proseku, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are delayed, for example, on the route between Karl<0xC3><0xBD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and N<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At 8 a.m., the Prague crisis staff will again sit down.
The railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech railways had already had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to the snow.
There are problems, for example, the route from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already downhill, but only with increased caution.
On Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko there are three intersectional roads, on Brno there are snow languages and on Blanensk it is necessary to cope with some communications in the above-placed snow chains.
Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko was one of the most affected places.
So far there are closed routes: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
In their stretching it will be necessary to put the cutters.
When they will be crossed, can't be estimated yet.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk, caution is needed in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only maintained by inert spray for nature protection, there is a layer of snow up to five centimeters, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, there was two to ten centimetres of snow, the most rainfall in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic has gradually stopped.
U.S. soldiers have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, currently known only as the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new gun is like a small super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles point the laser to a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm rifle shells, developed for this rifle and containing high-explosive mortars, actually work like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed to explode not only when it hits the target, but at any point in its ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
The top is usually not protected, and if a deadly rain of steel shards is carried on it, it can rule it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for the infantry to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding a target, sending a laser beam to it that determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of intent, according to it, adjusts the direction and presses the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun loads and fires the shot at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs are being relocated
Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Japan’s Fujitsu Group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on Wednesday by a giant in the field specializing in computers and their maintenance, in July next year 400 men and women will move their workplace from the previous administrative building on the Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to the Nieburger Landmark, which is in a large administrative complex in Lyon.
According to a spokesperson for Fujistu, another 100 of the group’s jobs are expected to be relocated there in the foreseeable future, which are still divided in the region.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and the large-scale offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the working style of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only on rent.
Bernd Wagner, Chief Executive Officer, said: “In Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a headquarters with excellent infrastructure.”
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday caused joy in the winners and disappointment in the losers.
Frankfurt-based chief economic reporter Markus Frank (CDU) said he had succeeded in gaining a “global player”.
It is said to be a “fantastic expression of trust in this location.”
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was reportedly informed in good time by the company’s management of its intention.
"Of course, we offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the troubles of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Square.
As a result, there were economic reasons.
Now it is a question of preventing a long non-occupation in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus Square, which Fujitsu has used so far, and the neighbouring "Kleine Verticale" were among the most discussed construction plans of the spa town ten years ago, along with other buildings on Marienbader Square.
Between the railway station and the town hall it was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer so-called urban entrance, which was criticized both for the massive construction of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which at the time was still associated with Siemens, moved home.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year were sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu’s employees are in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad and other subsidiaries will be Fujitsu Services and TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name points to the stellar floor, which is twenty years old, is also home to, among others, the central association of the electrical and electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting close.
The Amazon Internet service has turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic detachments.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, the platform for detection, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous home server in America and are now searching for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol search list, is set to abstain, according to a news release in the UK.
"WikiLeaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the land of the free," activists said in a tweet on Wednesday (local time).
Just before that, the Internet company Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic messages in order to cope with the high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: “Fine – we’re going to spend our dollars now by employing people in Europe.”
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, “then they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after collaborators with Senator Joe Lieberman reportedly conducted a search, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate House Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier release of classified information on Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"WikiLeaks acts illegally, recklessly and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life across the planet," a non-partisan senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether U.S. or foreign, should help WikiLeaks in their efforts to spread the stolen material.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol search list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard says he knows the exact location.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigues of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee has asked the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks to be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to the prime minister Stephen Harper said on television - apparently ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target plane".
In the meantime, a verbal shooting broke out between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for the recently released espionage challenges to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we’re interested in the opinion of one person with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
The Special Envoy was appointed as the deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary structural reforms" that are necessary after the release of messages from the embassy to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to explore ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are in danger of being posted to WikiLeaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them if it's necessary."
The Ice-cream University
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for the future ice cream maker, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does that ice cream come from?
From Gelatia and from Gelatia.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated ice cream maker, produces a cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes the ice cream from the cooling box with a wiper, cuts it into a tray and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
If you want to know more about ice cream, you can’t avoid the “Gelato-University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer established an ice cream university to make ice cream from its machines fit the high Italian ideals everywhere.
A basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some in their Midlife-Crisis yearn for a new career, others venture to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all over the world - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the industrial Ice-Cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream factory in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's household came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the Southern and Patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then includes a notable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients milk, starch, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything electronically to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then it turns on the machine with a tap and runs out pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice creams.
Immediately, the professor is overwhelmed with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you experiment on your own?
Luciano warns him to let himself be abducted by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently also used stabilizers - mostly a natural product such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will eat the ice cream itself.
Certain variations of the basic matter are permissible.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to force you a lot of flavored ingredients."
"But you should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from a white base, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa to be the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now the participant can take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and flaxseed ice cream - either with or without eggs in the basic matter, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Licorice ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more licorice nuts.
The most popular ice cream from kiwi is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture properly highlights the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach pyrs with a lot of sugar are used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra serving of sugar is needed.
Luciano extracts a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (winners thus measure grape must).
Luckily, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the device for the automatic production of the basic matter.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream at the same time and cools to minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we will not avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo smothers himself and his colleagues as well with a fruit pie when a huge mixer escapes his control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Auditors in a double light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for estimating the effects of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Christoph Then, the head of the Munich Testbiotech, said on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, the head of the EFSA Group on Genetically Modified Plants, and another EFSA expert have been in a contract with the Ilsa Lobbyist Association for several years.
It is financed by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in the EFSA control regulations for genetic plants, and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The provisions of the EFSA are said to be consistent in all paragraphs with the Ilsi documents and thus carry a manuscript of the industry, which should be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from EFSA switched without any additions or transitional time to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the EU’s staff connection to the industrial lobby, sparking interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and EU members.
In the meantime, the EFSA cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, i.e. also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It is referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics – among other things for estimating the risks of biotechnology without a lobbyist’s contract.
Independent experts such as Then are criticizing that currently the holidays are genetically modified plants in animals without any attempt to feed, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn in the field will do,” Then says.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
“If they don’t look for risks, how could they be found?” he asks.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
She has been studying genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, the industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any scientists who would not be affiliated with the group.
Most of the time, studies that are critical to society are not published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck believes.
Foot of the Stones
Uli Gsell also took some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of a train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is well known: In September, the excavations arrived and began to crush a large piece of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands protested against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in train stations.
When the construction was completed, most of the wings were in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft coarse stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He got a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It reads, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When he cut one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with those pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen at the former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all those that arose during the burglary in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were to break into a ditch or disappear at a landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden booth that was formerly a guardhouse.
He recounts that he was being bullied and threatened when in all the newspapers in September, he claimed to have bought the remnants of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he's been talking to opponents of S-21 all day.
And he explained to them that after the demolition, he could not at all.
And when that happens, then it's the wisest thing to keep using the stones.
Then took about 200 S-21 opponents each one about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, some also hope to return it during the reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, the cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest has long since been sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled away what fits in the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart long ago turned into "walls" or as the edges of the weeds with herbs.
“This stone really isn’t anything special,” Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political slump."
He gets into his off-road car and rides his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, discontinued his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone trader.
And a stone lover.
40,000 tons of stones have been deposited.
He's bundling his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antique stone dealer in the republic.
Brakes.
In the snow lies artistically crafted sandstone.
“They once belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden,” he says.
The sandman from Labe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My favorite stone. "
We continue on our way up through the woods.
It points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
Once these squares belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow are rocks and stories, Cannstatt-travertine from the police presiding in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of St. Blasien, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were previously broken by hand and transported using simple wheelchairs and bull carriages, he becomes completely venerable.
"It would be a scandal if something like that went wrong."
He didn’t become rich, very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone trader employs 14 people and in addition, stoneworkers, one sculptor, one carpenter, one glassworker and one gardener settled on top of the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says one who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Cologne in the near future.
The stones will be saved there as well.
Fighting for High-Potential Talents
There are a lot of people at the snack.
16 students are squeezed at breadcrumbs with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students of engineering and design to the workshop.
Together with VW’s developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future – and to get to know Volkswagen by the way.
Many companies strive to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, and bet on cooperating with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, recruit the most talented graduates in the classroom, even before they get to the job market and will be interested in others.
Since universities do not publish any lists of their students’ successes, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the car group is trying to acquire talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department distributes spoons, rubber bears and plates with the VW logo.
He talks to promising young talents about internship programs, student employment, and points them out to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is in charge of the project together with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be the right fit for a collaborator.”
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
The good news is that they are fighting so openly for students.
“Otherwise, it was a rather substantial professional project,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from long-term candidates.
On the contrary, they must strive and strive to attract particularly highly qualified labour forces.
Above all, graduates of the engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineers’ Association (VDI), 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI, the so-called shortage of engineers will continue to grow.
After the audit and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
It organizes challenging Recruitment events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find their way by GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
At the same time, participants can check out the KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two selection rounds who will take part.
Only Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me from many interested will fly to the USA.
In the battle for High Potentials at universities, according to Dykta, increasingly tough laws will apply.
"We want to be different with our Race from the others."
"A one-way sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like Dikta's talent hunter is lucky.
“We stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year.”
“Some will soon graduate and plan to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct contact on campus, small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically on the labour markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“For example, at Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, head of the human resources department of Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are listed on the company’s website.
“At the moment, it’s difficult to fill the gaps.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is contact via professors at universities.
Solarworld is cooperating with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to do an internship or write a diploma thesis."
The solar specialist does not arrange any expensive advertising.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: a personal atmosphere, a low hierarchy and easy communication.
“Big companies often can’t offer this,” says Stübe, Head of Personal Affairs.
Money has not played a major role in finding a job for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good procedural options are other crucial factors.
In one study, Solarworld ranked the Great Place to Work Institute 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and work environment, and the framework conditions of the employees are monitored.
The head of Stübe’s personal department hopes that the placement will bring her points for job seekers.
“I think that the interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of the potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
This is professionally referred to as internal Employer Branding, i.e. the enforcement of the employer in the market within the framework of its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employers among friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing with a string,” Kriegler says.
Obama to Stop New Oil Drills
Over the next few years, a new oil well will not emerge off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus revoked with final validity of the earlier plans.
For now, even before the Atlantic coast, new wells are banned.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should last at least the next five years, is the explosion on the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure of the opposition and industry’s willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
To date, there is no clear explanation as to who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigative committee, commissioned by Obama, is expected to submit the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban he paid for the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies applied for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster by tighter controls and stricter security regulations.
At the moment, there is a fundamental reform of the control authority, which has alerted itself to many allegations of corruption.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would cancel the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that stricter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil mined in the bay.
“Government plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of the gas and oil industry,” according to a recent survey by BDO, a consulting firm, before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is complaining about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects go as far as appeals - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni region burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of runaway oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People are fed by theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks that well.
“Don’t worry,” says the environmental activist, “you’ll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today.”
A 37-year-old Nigerian man was watching an attempt to photograph a boy wading around his chest with water surrounded by swamps: the scene acts in a water-gloss with rainbow colors almost beautifully.
The fact that under the surface of the blue brown oil deposits, is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough shrimp in containers, Esther Badom tells on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water has become completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge flood area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the world’s worst-hit areas.
On the way down the river through mangrove basins with many side tributaries, the entire range of launches is only noticeable.
The motor on the boat boils instead of light water with a brown spoon, and whoever dips his hand in the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves stick out of the ground like black currant sticks, rarely occurring palms let their leaves hang sadly.
We are in vain looking for a flock of birds that are common in wet areas: As soon as the engine shuts down on the boat, it will disperse in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, terrifying silence.
“What is happening here is the ecological leadership of war,” says sadly Celestine Akpobari: “We live in constant fear of health.”
A comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago the first conquerors from Europe gathered here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni area: while the entire three-sized delta area of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometers of pipeline more than two million barrels of black gold is exploited daily, the oil field in the Ogoni area is not a jetty, but a bucket.
Every few hundred meters, a steel structure sticks out of the water like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so they are very tenderly called the heads of boreholes.
They're 50 years old, most of them up to the sea.
Every moment, such a head of a hole breaks, says Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion liters of oil have flown into the delta over 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil that was spilled into the sea near Alaska in the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes about who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disasters.
While Shell labels sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists refer to the cracking heads of holes and leaky water as the main cause.
In 2008, U.S. Scientist Richard Steiner said that the number of faults in the pipeline is “several times higher than elsewhere,” according to Shell.
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-stained workshop under the wide sky, emerges from the mangroves of the character: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many tanks, which are partly connected by a pipeline, partially scattered over the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in the fire pit for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, it flows out of the pipeline into the catching tank of gasoline, later caps at the end of the kerosene pipeline and finally oil.
In this way, Michael and his four collaborators produce up to four 300-litre barrels a day: "We'll make 34,000 Nairas" - about $22.
The people of the delta are exploiting a chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents per litre of petroleum can still surpass illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from “bunkers” that connect to the lead all over the Ogoni region: experts say that the entire Niger River Delta is losing at least 16 million liters of oil per day.
But only a negligibly small portion of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally harvested: the largest share will be filled by organized crime networks, including politicians and high-ranking army officials, into tankers and sold it on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by the residents and their interventions or lax production methods is considered purely academic by activist Akpobari.
“If the oil companies had not considered themselves to be intruders, and if they had not completely destroyed the life of the fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refinery.”
In the meantime, however, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so shattered that it only takes into account the group’s departure: “Maybe other nations like the Chinese will turn out to be better.”
Michael's worried.
“It’s time to get lost,” says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come at any time."
If they were found by a special military unit, they would not face prison, but rather a painful paycheck.
Also, soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
“So the damn thing got our land in every way down to the bottom,” Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major security flaw.
Investigators found during an inspection of the machine that landed in an emergency, a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas airbus passengers were apparently more fortunate in an emergency landing at the beginning of November than was previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s during its investigations - and now warns of a possible crash.
Perhaps the flaw would have severe consequences: cracks could arise on one oil link due to wear and tear, the ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could lead to a “catastrophic engine failure.”
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British manufacturer of turbines.
She submitted the reasons for the lawsuit to the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce has identified the cause of the burning oil damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be exchanged around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with the huge aircraft that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The lack of safety has been deemed important enough to inform all the parties concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa has replaced an A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-seater aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall is causing chaos in the transport sector
The whole of Germany was in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, the connection between trains and planes is disrupted.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Nearly the entire republic fell on Thursday night in freezing snow temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there is up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several highways and many roads there is a very limited traffic.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but could not cope with the new snow.
In addition, there was still a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy storm in the morning on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snow curtains in Saxony caused significant problems on highways and state roads.
According to the Meteomedia bad weather center, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland was the level of alarm on purple - the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow occurred, strong and fresh winds caused curtains.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have reported major difficulties on the roads.
On the A2 caused wind and snow slow operation and clogging.
In Durynsk there were problems due to the snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major problems in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Durin and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the rails, overturned trees on the rails or broken upper leads and outposts.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
Saalfeld had to stop an ICE in Munich.
165 passengers on the train received woollen blankets, food and drinks from firefighters and rescuers.
There was a snowy wind coming across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports due to the snowy winds.
According to a spokesperson for the Flight Information Centre, flights have already been reported to be cancelled from Munich.
Frankfurt am Main has been cancelled for 40 years, according to a spokesperson for Fraport.
Road maintenance is in continuous operation.
Although few passengers are left at the airport without a connection, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There have been accidents on many roads as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to the snowy road: a truck was also caught at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver is dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train, so the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning hours.
A 30-year-old woman died after turning to a slippery road at Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, meteorologists have the good news: the snow will remain in the form of light snow, and therefore it will rise even in light winds.
But the wind's going down.
Only on the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds with the force of the wind.
But it will be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say good-bye to its brand: according to one newspaper article, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could cost up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished its corporate headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s bank district have been modernised; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group apparently wants the cost of the renovation back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, according to the Financial Times Deutschland with a reference to the spokesperson.
The spokesperson did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
“We’re still investigating whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it again,” he said.
With this, the largest credit institution in Germany relinquishes its corporate headquarters for a short period of time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from investors in its own funds and subsequently refurbished them expensively.
According to data, the energy conversion amounted to about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the towers, which have been renamed "Greentowers", at a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesperson said it was not decided whether the building would be resold to the property of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of mourners for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honoured the monument of New Zealand's inundated miners who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It was still not possible to rescue the dead, because the security situation is still complicated in the shaft.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were trapped in the valley.
In the shaft where the accident occurred, the probe was launched, but it did not reveal any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, authorities and experts came to the conclusion that the miners no longer have a chance to survive.
He was still unable to liberate the dead.
Now they honor the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth, on the southern island of New Zealand, for sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the monument of the miners, 29 tables were built, on which were helmets, lamps and names of miners.
Also pictures and personal items such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
The state government buildings were covered with flags on half a shelf.
New Zealand hoped the miners would come out of the "deep depths of the country" again, Prime Minister John Key told attendees of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot say goodbye to his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also participated in the commemoration.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also trapped.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the toxic gases dissolve, it begins to cool the high temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is Horror Appropriate for Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to cross the old border again with his combat epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured one-eyed Viking fighter (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his opponents with almost supernatural force in a big way - it sounds ideal for young men's spectators, who do not want to kill the spectators, who seek the methods of bloody action, because our hero does not want to kill them.
On the other hand, the One-eyed, as he is actually called, will not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters will say at most one or two sentences or be drawn to passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and hovering in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings about thousands of years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It’s good when the film has more target groups, it’s only a pity when they excrete each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized "Pusher" drug dealer trilogy, is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists to bring his works either more humorous to the mainstream or less brunt.
Most fans of art cinema are likely to be discouraged by the squirming brains and interiors everywhere.
Fans of the action films are shunned no later than the moment when the One-eyed man sets out for freely-explained reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem and stays hung forever in the air and fog before he appears to be a gentleman.
So it is no wonder that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get to the cinema and was now released only on DVD.
It’s a shame mainly because of the beautiful footage, but also because behind a special facade, places up to the bloodshed, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it’s not about dialogue or an exact story, it’s all about an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
This is not an escape for the spectator.
Refn does not spare him even the moment of release and slowly suffocates him with his chilling footage and cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all an indescribable hatred that haunts the characters from the heart.
Only a little blonde boy who helps the One-eyed keeps something as innocence, all the others are driven by evil.
Of all the most unicorns, the hero whose motives are never explained, who will become the time for enemies and transitory allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It represents destruction, perhaps, but also only for the spoiled.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a new warning about Syria’s secret nuclear program.
The country, however, is preventing expression - and will not even allow control.
Around midnight from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the bank of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that is diverting from the current.
According to a statement from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Agency in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, she explained where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction, it is said to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were still photographs that showed the building close by or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before launch, but not yet without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, much more is not known than at the time, even the riddles have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but essentially had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a “supposed reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “reliable.”
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how certain he is that he has a reactor in front of him, the U.N. top diplomat said in the summer, the IAEA has “sufficient material to ask questions.”
The debris of allegedly “unused military buildings” was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar managed to find traces of uranium that was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the time just after the attack, which should be more thorough than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these footage are not on the market because it was exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA turned it off after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as the satellite footage.
In addition, he forbade auditors from another inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," the prime minister at the time, Ehud Olmert, confirmed in an official statement.
The investigation of this case has been running inconsistently since June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the agency", as acknowledged by a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - which is a serious breach of the IAEA's ban treaty.
The IAEA considers three other devices to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
The auditors have not yet stated which device is in question, which function they have, or why they are suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, driven again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. (ISIS) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspect objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base – precisely for this reason, Syria is refusing IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was heard that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition – that the IAEA would have been sent in advance by the US to search the military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has documents and also satellite images that transported material here and there between these three places and the square on the Euphrates.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one set up should be "in connection with fuel production".
There is, however, "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. enrichment of uranium and reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where plutonium would later be decomposed by a bomb, there are only probable estimates of these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris that could hide important traces is stored in these three places.
The Jacobs have disappeared from the surface of the land of hundreds of truck charges, no one seems to have any information on where the dump got.
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had Syria checked in 1998 as a suitable storage facility for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from space, however, show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out groundwork at all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months devising a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrecy - only that effort shows how great the interest of auditors is.
Damascus, meanwhile, has also rejected this proposal.
If, a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor was destroyed, and therefore the thing is not burning, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections for several months, which is one of the toughest means to control.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already talked about "opportunities I'm cloning to in the future", but is hesitant.
This choice poses a great risk: on the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat warns, "What happens when they finally find nothing?"
Love in a time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on the still-nameless directorial debut in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but it also causes unrest.
It is persistently said that the woman, who is a Muslim, falls in love during the war in Yugoslavia with the Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo quickly moved to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film has been released in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote through the UN refugee agency UNHCR to help Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, Bosnian newspapers now reported - Jolie is also the UN ambassador to help refugees.
It's not exactly diplomatic - it offered women meetings in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where she was raped, love stories did not work out, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization has therefore recommended to the UN to help refugees to release Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, allowed the filming after the smaller hooligans in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why then Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author emphasizes that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted much effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains indefinite.
There is another version of the film on the internet, which sounds quite different: lovers knew each other before the war began and meet again when she is like a Bosnian Muslim dragged into a Serbian camp, where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer".
The fact that the Jolie movie really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that there is a pressure on her that "is not fair and is based on incorrect information."
Now they can liberate her from Hollywood by illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done so many times before.
Nothing but away.
Tonight it's good again for Iry.
Not even a trace of sadness.
The domestic team dominates significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout with joy at the sound of loud music, with their butts.
The Bailey-Pub in southern Cork is hot as players throw tennis balls three meters away into beer keels – and hit each other.
"Beer Pong" is called bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and also tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this screaming beer game and a restrained computer scientist, it doesn’t get too cold together.
Yet the 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, to answer the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a gaming passion in Las Vegas, he's going to New Zealand for an interview in January.
“I have such a strange feeling,” he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of the Tanner's three siblings have already tried for their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, according to experts at the ESRI Institute of Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
There will be 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After decades of ascent, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, the discontent is now again spreading.
The economic crisis is especially unsure of the young, educated Irish, who have so far only experienced a rise.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years of boom.
Everyone needed it, the money was too much.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are many letters from readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes from the hill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"Let the last one, please, shut it off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future black because the government is only deceiving and offers no prospects for the future to young people.
“They’re reducing the minimum wage, but they don’t have any strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her classmates wander from one unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of work abroad.
“For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps to the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website are photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gale, but freedom and joy.
What it's like to build something somewhere else, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to be able to pay off his home loan.
“The situation is sometimes a bit crazy,” he says, when for the first time in a long time the threshold of his own home is exceeded.
"I'm making money in Germany on a house in Ireland where I'm not really at all."
He laughs desperately and walks in cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, in the entrances there are large expensive cars parked.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it shouldn't work out well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything turns around, I can start again."
A construction engineer doesn’t like the cries he hears so often.
“No one has to starve – our situation isn’t as dramatic as it used to be on this island,” he says.
"Working abroad is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for England after the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back again and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let yourself have an open future and just wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years now, and why should it not be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there’s one more thing that worries him a lot these days: celebrating his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might turn around for a goodbye party.
“No emotion at all,” he says, drinking beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it the party of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Criminal activity raises more fears than unemployment.
And many regions consider Brazil to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995, it can thus monitor changes in attitudes across areas.
In this year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first of these is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per annum since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also grown in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are democratic beliefs, which is down the regional average (see graph 2).
Around 44% of respondents across the country expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, which is the same number as last year, but a large increase compared to the year 2001, when it was 25% (Figure 3).
Around 34% said they trust the House in their country and 45% trust the government, again with the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
The support came about during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (UNECE) Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood changes over a wide spectrum from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its resigning president, Luis In<0xC3><0xA1>cia Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the condition of violent crime worsened.
It is only the second time since surveys began that more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or their close relatives have been victims of crime in the past year, but this is a drop compared to 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private businesses and market economies: approximately 71% of respondents across regions say that private business is necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents share the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered to be the most influential respondent country in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized Elections
No one expected that the general election in Haiti on November 28 would be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections were filled with urns and recurring votes, ballots scattered across the channels, broken polling rooms and intimidation.
Electoral chambers open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, have been roaming around trying to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that “in many respects, it was a pretty good choice.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean said cautiously that “they do not believe that these inequalities, no matter how serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular resignation president and his candidate Jude Celestino, is scheduled to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All the electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former First Lady, have resigned from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
The problem may arise, however, if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is labelled by the electoral commission for having achieved a decisive struggle.
Due to the cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, fears that election attendance will be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganization they were prevented from doing so.
Approximately 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians will settle for it themselves.
After the peaks in the center
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the Argentine president, benefits from the sympathy of the public, when her popularity has increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term in next year’s elections may depend on whether the grieving Ms Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez relinquishes the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first pair to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized when Mr. Kirchner died of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic meetings (in which the government was rigged and accused of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to swear," said the president.
The budget for 2010 will now also apply for next year, with the president having more space to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: this year it is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official rate of inflation is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about numbers approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina suffered an economic collapse, prioritized growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleaned up INDEC, the statistical agency that joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Is it possible for President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez to die this policy?
She called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to reduce wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was backed by rising world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a large devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez says she wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina did not pay back in 2001.
Now, President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez faces an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which he owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact is not overseen by the IMF as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide “technical assistance” to propose a new national consumer-price index that will recall the introduction to clean up the INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will want to remain in politics after the end of her term, when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, which is tired of Kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer vacation, which they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly give up the many opinions that her husband held in politics.
A half-hearted encouragement to China
Taiwan's voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of whom are eligible, voted on November 27 for mayors and city councilors in five city districts, which may be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeo.
President Ma himself is a representative of the sentiments that dominate the continent and have a strong presence in business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, in the largest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only tightly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the mayor's five offices, it failed to win a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is prone to greater independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party together with the KMT was in the city councils.
Elections were held like most of Taiwan's elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags with sparsely dressed girls.
There was even a obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitating for the KMT candidates on the eve of the elections.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, wounded him, and killed the spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates polled about plans for state housing construction and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
Therefore, the KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abandoned the agitation of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact that China’s trade is crucial to Taiwan’s economic survival.
On his side, President Ma confirmed that China’s policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue its commercial retaliation, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to set up a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but in the background.
It will be better to wait for it after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a tyrant and advocate of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been called as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-change, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “trustworthy alternative” to Mr. Ma’s stupefied approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be pissed off by this move.
In a statement from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice among potential candidates.
The KMT has the right to search for its own people.
Mr Ma’s ratings were poor, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go campaigning with him.
His dislike seems to be based primarily on unemployment and a deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says he is reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strictly enforced proposals to support Taiwan for the establishment of friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy Award nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
At the request of the president and the people must be aware of the law.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is named one of this year’s Grammy Awards surprises with nominations for Best New Artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but this is in accordance with the rules of the Grammy, when the artist is allowed to release no more than three albums on an identity album before "it is set in a given."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and hilarious hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about the following categories of Spalding's aftermath as a success, which was recorded in 2003 by Jon eks.
Elsewhere Grammy jury members rightly appreciate Vijay Iyer’s trio “Historicity” in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was a hot favourite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a scrappy favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with steampunk knowledge gained several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large ensembles, when the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble stood in competition and the still-brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" can pick up as a ruttle.
Grammy Awards Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey Lead Classical Music
Nominations for classical music at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The lead in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with a number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The Classical Music Producer of the Year category has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominated for the classic album, Bruckner and his Symphony Nos. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the "Boston Modern Orchestra" and the "Symphony" from the Symphony.
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin.
Composers who are nominated for a Grammy for Contemporary Music include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionate Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salone.
The approximately 30-minute play is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with an orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avitala, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category, led by the Chicago Symphony for recording Stravinsky's work.
Instrumental soloists who received nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpsichordist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition classics, soprano Jessye Norman won a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula gets approval from the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a suspension of trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"Opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against it only shout loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
Negotiations began at six o’clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time they took up discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
"There is no longer America," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty fallen into the sand."
"America is down."
The planned Islamic Center has also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, tragedy that took place in New York when terrorists attacked New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had been stranded in Riverside County for years without an incident, but wanted more and more suitable space than the storage space he rented together with a filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the City Council about the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the space to search for new life forms on Earth and perhaps even further.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand out from the main elements that have so far been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has a double ability."
"It can grow by either phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it’s not proof that it’s some form of truly ‘foreign’ life,” commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared Thursday in the online journal Science.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"You'll start to wonder what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is important for the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this novelty published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry, and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences at the Miltons University, Open Research Institute.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so consider that a microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one after the other.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the chances are that a life form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced with phosphorus, is not new, but there has never been an example of this.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that earlier forms of life could have used it.
"This suggests that there could be other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The rest of the stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs, which were stolen from the Bellflower motel, were found, the Los Angeles sheriff reported on Thursday.
Four exhibiting dogs — two Akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgi — disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs later on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles area police department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, at what location, nor did he share detailed information about their finding.
"The investigation is still going on."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not reached to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two aunts found themselves in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representative found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace and a 10-month-old dog Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds that planned to take part in this week’s regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undiscovered until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to take part in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they plan to show Trace.
Other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop away on a couple’s nearly month-long dog show trip.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs – a puppy boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittish oar – who stayed with them in the motel room.
The Akitas and Pembroke Welsh Corgis left the car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs. The dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to scream again now that MGM’s restructuring is getting final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM was finally given the green to start over.
A federal insolvency judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packed" plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company focused on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
With Thursday’s release that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Insolvency Code, MGM remains no legal hurdles to relaunch Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become top studio executives.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 out of the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on a planned $500 million loan to fund MGM’s new operations and production.
Now it’s a connection to an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the management how to solve their finances, as the management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial problems of MGM and 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the finances demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to relaunch production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the funding of two films, the prequel of which will be the book "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, sought to merge with Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that will keep your budget for gifts in balance
This year’s leading candidate is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system, but in both cases it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 beads or about 48 Play-Doh sticks.
However, there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s law works; this year’s tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While there have been relatively fewer new toys with affiliated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkins and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the number of toys with charging batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, from 3 years) are plush animals that sing when you press their belly.
With one press, the animal gives out a tone and the other press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start cating, you can’t stop.
Best choice in combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year I borrowed a 14-inch anime doll on Elmo Live technology that can play Simon Says and can also walk a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, although their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80s kid, you might remember Alpha, one of the first computer-educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a backpack full of quizz cards that are designed to turn driving into fun with a self-healing, fun workbook.
If you are sending a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest easy-to-use version, with qvalues keyboard, although games don't have as effective instruction as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12 years older), the first major change in the Leapster's disrof series.
No version is compatible with older drives.
The iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children aged 3 to 7) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are no larger than a box of lighters, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before time runs out; it’s great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkins and Club Penguin toys were represented at the highest level in the toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle animal.
A little bigger than the brush on your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years old), the latest in a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The brouk moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It’s fun when you make a mauve out of bones and see if he manages to find a way out.
It is also very durable.
The one of us was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the hut of our dog.
Implementation of more policing controls in China
As an urban military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked down the square, scrutinized his orders, and issued orders quietly with military authority.
He wanted female members—Chinese state enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their harsh actions and fondness for violence—to convey a certain impression on the thugs around them.
"Stand up straight!"
"Quickly!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what beautiful girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood in the spotlight.
Four pairs of black boots are sorted according to the rule.
The four head covers fit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang cautiously.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new targets to have a higher education.
The Guangdong province has changed the gray-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced a skewed view of strong armaments: In 2009, a report said that 50 officers surrounded a wagon with snacks and stared at the owners with skewers until a domestic salesman was in the spotlight for half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women, who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The goal is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a more delicate, female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city decree, impose fines and other administrative measures.
But the Chinese media is usually capturing a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province stabbed an uninvolved spectator to death after he used his cell phone to shoot them as they began to intervene in a protest against the landfill.
Last year, police training was held in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without bloodmarks.
This year, a domestic melon trader in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left brain injury.
A video game full of violence, which can be downloaded online, shows Chinese policemen attacking a street vendor.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, the national publication, complained last year after another discussion about tactics.
On the paper was "really thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say that this approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News' editorial looked at whether women have real duties or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female candidates aged 18 to 22 with a good character and "five facial features in the right proportions."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the job is too psychologically challenging for women over the age of 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer told Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the series of nature and "internal quality".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city’s district management, disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that height requirements are common in China also for other job positions, both sexes.
As well as the requirement for proportional facial features.
Which means that the question of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
A medical disability or freezing will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a man who is quiet or backed up to serve us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is guarding Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, has an apple-like face and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist feel, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
The 21-year-old, Xu Yang, says, “Our task is to represent the image of the city.”
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just to drive traders into the streets where they can carry out their business.
Every morning, the group stands up against more than ten traders who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times already," said Miss Xu, as the merchant began to run away, leaving his wheel with a cart of noodles for a while.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
“Every day is essentially the same thing,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies free marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female police officers do not have the powers as their male counterparts to be able to confiscate the goods.
They can only threaten to report that fact to their male leaders. . . .
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that police had killed salespeople.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers were stationed that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner of the street.
Police seized a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the car could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute distance in front of the cops, face to face, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator of the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only auxiliary roles.
Unlike them, they are not trained in image maintenance and cooling.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said succinctly.
“It’s usually the public that starts with it.”
Prosecutors won't accuse Senator Ensign
The Justice Department’s prosecutors cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator’s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who, until the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair got into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "definitely delighted" with the decision, which followed almost a year after the investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings with the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of an investigation and that it is not planning to bring any further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice who claimed there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing for a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents published in the October 2009 New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to silence Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, after his death.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in Ensign's campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews are provided.
Since Hampton was recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was banned from the law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton's unusual dealings, who were friends before the affair, appeared in violation of the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was released, “it turned out to be a clear case of preparing for a violation of the law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in the defense of clients who are being investigated by the government.
While officials at the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said that the Ministry is cautious about the state's b-proceedings after a year's trial, after a large number of failures, including a decision.
The federal prosecutors “clearly hid the weapons,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of lawyers who filed several complaints against Ennunu in the case.
“This essentially indicates that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the laws,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief attorney, said in an interview that he had been called by the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and then the next day, telling him that the ministry had not found any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in Wednesday's statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he handed over to the prosecutors.
“I’m not happy to make up the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice except that we think they’ve made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to halt an investigation into a separate complaint in which the Ethics Group alleges that Ensign's parents' payment to the Hamptons in the amount of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major non-government company that supported the senator for a long time.
One email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started working as a lobbyist in the company, Ensign's chief of staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "infiltrated" the Ministry of the Interior about the subject discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When a report on the affair first appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to take part in the third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow up with the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people," she said.
The Cheshire community's call is addressed on Twitter
In a number of courtrooms, half a dozen of them were written.
Minute by minute, they sent messages of horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says that more than 140,000 tweets were about raping and tying children to beds in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, was sentenced to death, and was due to be formally terminated with the imposition of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court would likely have employed for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the process – including the widespread use of Twitter by major reporters – created a “circus atmosphere” and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with disturbing details then led the jury to a decision in the decision making.
This claim could force the judge to address the question of whether the advent of new technologies also does not require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced with this disguise, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technologies in the courtroom will affect the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Judge Jon C. Blue of the state’s Supreme Court has briefly rejected claims regarding last week’s returns and that media outlets have been “carefully checked” and that there is no public evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the process.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, when he said in his ruling that in the Sheppard versus Maxwell case, the media case was "attacked".
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes’s ruling half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be needed to determine how to communicate from the courtrooms, which was not the case in Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in highly watched cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out voluntarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be puzzled by the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms could make the trial fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of Mr. Hayes’s many shadow lawyers who would have been able to argue for years to deter enforcement.
For example, attorneys also argue that Mr. Hayes’ case could be a presumption when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos inciting terror when he was selected by the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by photographs of victims Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Prosecutors say they also reject the constitution of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury who was critical of the prosecutors and that by his decision incorrectly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to postpone the weekend.
The jury was not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to last month’s verdict that the case was dominated by news in Connecticut and was debated during the election campaign of a candidate for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly invigorating the flames of emotion in this case.
"The daily raid of the media, cameras and reporters in front of the court," wrote the lawyer, "was something that was not yet visible here in New Haven and it may also be a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter’s actions is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that immediate reporting was more disruptive than the reports reported later, and in their view, the judiciary police should control the scope of further trials.
But some lawyers have demanded appeals courts with the often-used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court ruling of 1966 in the Dr. Sheppard case, due to the widening of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard versus Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the rift?
After the campaign, which was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of courtesy emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first wave of genuine cooperation between the two political parties, or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting of President Obama and parliamentary leaders did not bring any key findings on key issues that need to be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a courteous discussion of the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as a definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party bias.
The President's deficit committee's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built up mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological gap that is still dividing the members.
And it's pretty hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
The two sides are now in a trial period - they probe each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday hearing and its subsequent evaluation by the participants were also carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too vast and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have been in place for the last two years.
Whether it’s a matter of taxes, expenses, health care, or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, Washington was preparing for the November election at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections were ripping off the emotions of the party, and then silenced them.
It's good."
Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution on a number of issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting.
Bush’s tax cuts at the end of the year have expired and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, either permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits, only because Republicans can't look at how they support tax cuts for the property while the unemployed refuse to support the unemployment benefit.
After Tuesday’s White House talks, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new start-up treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes for January.
Rather, a probable period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
“After the things that have to be done, the psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that courtesy will lead to real co-operation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act according to their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These advocacy lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reform of the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of Washington’s most difficult tasks and, in their opinion, have to develop the pressure of deficit issues into public programs in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury who propose that in the case of financial matters, at least today, we have small bases or the will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans call on Obama to resolve the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite bias in the recent election, most Americans want to continue to see the two parties working together.
If it could lead to a stalemate, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely watching the public’s reactions.
Anyone who threatens to reduce the vote will likely change the course and seek a compromise.
It can be an optimistic view of the matter.
The bias and orientation are now greater than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there was a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the courtesy that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground in the issues that still divide them.
U.S. Document Reveals Moscow as a Refuge for Corruption
The administration of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy” and continues with part of the bribes and protection bribes coming to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the vertical of the office" - will take its place when money starts to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on the sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when the mayor was still Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was resigned in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in cleanliness.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have consistently denied corruption charges for many years, and won several counts of false charges for such charges.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when he was asked about the evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's shit."
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will prove to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to meet such details spoken in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for foreign diplomats to do so.
“The government of the city of Moscow and its association with criminal bodies have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and confirm that the government acts more as a kleptocracy than as a government,” the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'Krysha' (a term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Attorney General's Office, as well as inside.
"Analysts have identified and three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are second-degree."
“Finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors.”
“It’s an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill vacant positions in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Moscow business owners realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they do not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the process."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself can already have trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay quickly enough, their stores are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men looting their suitcases, probably busy cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow-based research team Indem, said in a recent interview.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
“It is not part of the political class because there are no longer political classes in Russia.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without power-sharing, corruption is inevitable, he said.
He estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in the recent survey on the global perception of corruption by non-governmental organizations Transparency International (countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. embassy report, which appeared in Moscow until late in the evening, certainly did not excite the Russian government, albeit only to the extent that Moscow’s shortcomings can be blamed on Luzhkov, it may be for the Kremlin an opportunity to argue the matter.
In a CNN interview with Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks published could have been fake and reacted outragedly to a statement that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it's about our mutual interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In a lighted concrete classroom with stained and stained walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves that Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "slaughterhouse" for its cruelty during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, the commander in this remote Khmer Rouge country in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered, long-standing loyalty is also broken in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks, which for the first time explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers to children.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court will jointly issue the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the verdict of a former leader, notoriety-famous violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Spirit, to 35 years.
With each such advance, there has been growing unrest among the veterans of the Red Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to reconcile and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
“Among the former Khmer Rouge there is jealousy and fear, but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrown the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started an uprising, which lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated the followers in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began transitioning to the government that culminated in the 1998 capitulation of Ieng Sara and Nuon Chep in 1996.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by a utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raising without any idea of the realisation of a trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"That Mok enjoyed them all."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the head of the transferees and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the worries in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced workers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from field work to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had appealed to her, she would have refused to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If there are any more criminal prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who switched from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
“Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury its past in it,” he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer relations means blinding the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and is titled "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education History textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengu knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted sceptically when he took home the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has strong magic here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, the path is covered with grass and stuffed with discarded plastic bags, leading to a rectangle made of black sediments, covered with a rusty can roof.
Pol Pot's body here was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was buried there.
"But he has a strong spirit, a lot of local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of mature bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus Agrees to Seem to Have Uranium-Based Weapons
In a surprising victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it is giving up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the security summit of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that the stone hit last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, a couple of covert operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The deal proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s 47th National Summit on Nuclear Security in April, at which Belarus was expelled.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place for the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
“This proves that the process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Dozens of countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s summit on nuclear security, Belarus’ President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity... we don't intend to make dirty bombs and we don't intend to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago, Belarus acceded to the United States and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated, as the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to Russia’s storage and disposal facilities, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust,” which led to a deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Study this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium that can be used to produce weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint statement, seek to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, and the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving relations with each other and is essential for the country's progress and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make CIA jewels with flights
The Spanish government did not make jewels about CIA flights carrying detained Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo across Spanish territory, a U.S. envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which also states that the then First Lady of the Prime Minister, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, requested that the Spanish execution be informed by the locals, and "could show that she has a skeleton fit into the skeleton."
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing dozens of states, including Spain of cooperating in human rights violations, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
A spokeswoman for the prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication had "taken Zapatero's government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with the flights of intelligence services across its territory.
“They simply want to be informed” so that they are not “unprepared,” Aguirre said in one of the documents.
The then foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, told the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter as low a margin as possible, but because it was in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited options".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated file or sensitive information," the embassy said in an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concerns about "open coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than about the declassification of information by the CNI or the Department of Defense.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at the luncheon of U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence, they will do what they deem appropriate," he said.
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech: People's Party - ozn. trans.) in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to use any indications that Zapatero's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States of America, which might have been a case of a coup d'état that could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and that is a case of a coup d'état.
Confessed mother-murderer complains online about maternal 'care'
A young woman was talking about a baby when she was already dead, and had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez calls herself "Mukhi" on the Internet.
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend with this nickname, both of whom are from the village of Noia in the region of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
To be able to understand them, it is necessary to know the emotional life of a woman that the ABC diary reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They've been together for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if it was his newborn baby, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
You've recently found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to find a job, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palmyra.
However, from the content of her communication, it is apparent that the relationship has broken up.
In March 2008, he is alone in Menorca and writes, "Alberto is some angry that I left for work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but now he realizes that he has to be with a little boy all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I'm going to send you a baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me to leave the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th, because I have to go 20 for work so I don't miss that place."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son to himself.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be, so he'll be with me, and it'll never happen again in his life that I leave him with someone other than my mother," the dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There is another post in July.
When he pulls out this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but not on the other."
“He’s with me on one side and he likes it here, but on the other side he goes to school almost every day.”
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'll save some money for the babysitter."
The Seventeenth Greetings and Complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you videos on email, I don't know what kind of video he wants, he's going to meet me, sex is needed."
Thirty-second report: "The kid is doing well, going to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also one message about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the internet are M<0xC3><0xB3>ni<0xC4><0x8D>'s posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manze.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she was allowed to call herself "Muki's ex-prisoner".
"Terror in Galician (motto)".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his pity and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a free mother.
Yesterday, M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the Provincial Cathedral in Palma, where she arrived from the detention centre in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said the accused did not remember how everything happened and "that she did not intend to harm the little one in any way".
Before that, however, she admitted to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
The people would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats.
With the results of 28 November, the PP party could have a keynote address at the councils in Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes obtained and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia - ozn.) already has a given idea of the elections of the general elections, regardless of whether the number of elects, whether or not, is increased positively.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, persisted, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were to take place, the PPC could also have a unimée and a unimée.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of crucial importance for the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one member - now it has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, or it would win one more.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest deliverer will be held in May 2011 at the occasion of the municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the domination of the Socialists in the four main provincial counties, and also on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona).
Both nationalists and populists agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV parties.
Given the Republican debate, it would not be impossible if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona legislature - since it is necessary to get at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes won in the four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnover in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also won at other important councils such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
Currently, the PP has representation in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Previous articleCatalan Cell Provides Thousands of Passports to Al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
In 2008, seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged travel passports for different groups of Al-Qaida groups.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, its aim is to ensure with the help of "Operation Kampai" the weakening of the fake apparatus of Al-Qaida at the international level and "thus limiting its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then falsified and then delivered to groups that make up the European countries' criminal galaxy of Al Qaeda and could turn them into "military ones."
This broken cell was not the only active one that had a jihad network in Europe, and therefore, in addition to Thai services, other European police units took part in these investigations, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that in the next few days, there will be no such incidents as in other European countries.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) there were further developments in Thailand, with the Ehribum Buthart Buthan and the Muhhant and the Zehki.
It was these men who ran from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, stole passports, in particular, from tourists that met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, they must have been valid for several years, and they must not have been issued visas.
The investigative documents emphasize that as yet no facts are known that would link the Catalan detainees to the bombing in Bombay, although the author of the attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Thafik and Falkland Islands.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before the assassination, the Catalan transfer agency sent about a thousand dollars, which were "deposed" to buy cards into mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) calls on Masovians to stop the fiscal deal
The president of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camachov<0xC3><0xA1> had the opportunity yesterday to personally present Arturo Masov<0xC3><0xA1> his terms, under which she is willing to promote his introduction into the office of President Generalitat; the economics of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of Catalonia.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty of 18 parliamentary chairs received in the elections last Sunday, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the candidate of the CiU needs to reach the ranks to make at least one of the formations.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliance that the nationalists in the House would like to maintain until the general elections are held, but for now, the talks that are being held these days Mas with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to get her support for the inauguration, "she will have to end all the supremacy and liberation speeches", as well as an economic agreement - similar to that from Basque Country - that the CiU leader even wanted to let the referendum vote on.
The two leaders would like to stifle the vicious political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations on Masov’s inauguration will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat parties.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he is meeting with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of "lack of measures"
The presentation of the Olot Center does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday provided a press conference to outline the damage caused to the criminal institution by Joan Vily Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors he was in care.
The director of this house for seniors, Joan Sala, arrived accompanied by the facility's lawyer, Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit responsible for the murder", but the process would not "legal and accountable".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer due to the fact that it did not disclose the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, a great threat to the home of La Caritat presents now the demands for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the deceased.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had been committed as early as August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the clients of the home for the elderly, with the suspicion that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased, but that - given the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat, through its director, resolutely rejected this extremeness yesterday and stressed that "the lack of measures could not in any case be the cause of what happened".
La Caritat added that "there is no evidence in the case that any third party, other than the defendant's own, would have made a mistake."
A man now known as the "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and stated that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later killed the second old woman.
In this case, he caused death by administering too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case when he used a sedative pill mixture.
The director of La Caritat said it was complicated to control staff access to drugs.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably in six of the nine cases that this caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses now underway in the laboratory should show whether Vila was lying and actually looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or killing them by filing a lawn, as he admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims and do not rule out that the number of deaths may be higher than what he confessed to, and justify their behavior in various versions, submitted by Vila to the court with the knowledge that he must change his behavior when it turns out that he killed the axe.
That's why they say they want to be available to the judiciary so that the full scope of this matter is clarified.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
The marginal differentials closed by force and the shares of the European bank fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to make mistakes - the euro is just rising above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market, which, although it is declining, is recovering – but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank cited us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to resign for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the plan to buy back the state debt for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and to keep unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be forecast "at least until March" and to adhere to a three-month bid with unlimited access by the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying program and even announce its intensification.
If it does not meet the expectations created, it will re-create the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly reduce the rate of liquidity, God is with us!
The same was true at the May summit, where they said they hadn’t even thought about buying bonds, and there was a collapse of markets – history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and resilient.
In May, the armoured fist announced it on Monday and on Wednesday said it had already bought many of them, triggering further market collapse.
Yesterday's one-year bidding in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Therefore, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points, reflecting the change in market sentiment that occurred after the words of Trichet.
in Ireland has been published the numbers represent the losses Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and another 15,000 potential, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility, after the problem was not revealed by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need the approval of the new budget by parliament and still lacks sufficient support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the next EU summit on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would rather have Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action, which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment - to the ears of investors, this sounds like a four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock market has grown by 4.5%, double that of other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the response of the government and the Spanish National Bank was quick and convincing – we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond auction, which will be favored by the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in high demand to help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a rescue plan would be a self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would be closed to us.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not only to be that, but also to appear that way".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group attacks the negotiations of the company Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in an open conflict in the family of <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, is not quiet.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the group’s founder, attacked after he considered it “totally insignificant” the legal action of El Enebro, scheduled for the 16th of this month and demanded by five of his seven descendants, on which the Vega’s institutions should try to force the Bohemians to take their majority of their dreams out of power.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José set up a legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not appear to be willing to sue for membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
five of his seven descendants, who were appointed as transferees during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register, were drawn up from its Administrative Committee.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was convened by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has restored the silence in the womb of the Alvarez family.
Appeal to the judge is the only legal remedy to guarantee the appointment of the commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquirizov<0xC3><0xA1> considers David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by judicial means and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the proceedings".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this conduct as "totally insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already unsuccessfully tried to summon the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right of use of 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when resolving the issue of judicial review of the proceedings. The date of this resolving has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvements in the vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterised by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the chances of this new team too seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the riding skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula 1 - a "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put in the hands of a tiger from Red Bull.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating the marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of the very remote motorsport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to carry out “within a few hours, in near real time” modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during the shutter.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stall employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
Today, the Red Bull team is working on 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyze and propose every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be transferred from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capability is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art technology race around 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings, which are restricted to visitors - especially then to journalists.
Everything that is going on here is considered a “great secret.”
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is without a doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, behind the immeasurable technological resources that the energy drink brand has invested in its participation in the racing circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and no one knows them.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey says that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was due to the drivers.
Currently, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the success of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computational technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 own stores in two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona on Monday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2, which the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
As an example, Helena Herrer, the vice president of HP in Spain, gave an example of a newly rebuilt store on Barcelona’s Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has approved a plan to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrer, who also runs HP’s HR systems, said the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with an exclusive design of equipment stores (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in providing staff for stores.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be a franchise, emphasizing that the exclusive sales network aims to “improve customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises when purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging”.
The Barcelona store is part of a pilot, world-class pioneering programme, which aims to address any problems with the computer devices in the warranty.
The online service is connected to the technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve problems that might otherwise take up to two days."
“This system is designed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, since large companies already have contractual technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrer.
Sabadell Bets It Will "Steal" One Million Clients From Its Competitors In Three Years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s delegate, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but he rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it is calculated by lowering interest rates, which, however, will seek to compensate by deducting bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to win a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and be able to survive in difficult economic conditions.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan.
The goal is, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public assistance in the FROB, to gain a market share by capturing a million new private clients - and 700,000, respectively, if they are deducted from the bank - because until now, the client rather than the client's, the institute was swayed by the big and small scale.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private customers, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the core ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or so-called soberness, in order to reduce costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when presenting the results for the period.
Not many banking institutions at this time dare to set their goals and publicize them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking industry.
This year, Sabadell will close its Optima program, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension to another period.
Customers who leave the savings account will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "a difficult and very important year".
In fact, he believes that the journey from the crisis in Spain "will be long".
In addition, it will be "very difficult to create jobs" in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while he believes that the passive war – which reduces margins – is retreating, the price of the surcharge for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their issues in order to receive liquidity, is already shifting to credit prices, thereby offsetting the reduction of margins.
"The liquidity and financing theme is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase the prices of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that there is a trend in banking "now there is a reduction in commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not for free, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
“Next year there will be no stone left on the stone,” he said.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "decently reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter among the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB may involve raising funds on the market before the new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis continues to be a serious problem.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what it was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding using repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA Excludes Another Wave of Spartan Fusion
The Director-General of CECA rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of savings fusion, and again insisted on the speed at which the reorganization of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of associating Spanish savers started, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase would not take part and were waiting for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Spartans (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as the second round, what is happening are the conventions."
"Most of them are fully implemented; it is possible that we will go to 13 or 14 instead of 17 institutions, but all the major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA (Association of Executives and Executives of Aragon) meeting, Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is being carried out "with the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC5><0x82>y<0xC5><0x82>y <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC5><0x82>ych, which is not very satisfied with the <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC5><0x82>yk, as it is shown in the time to pay.
“To go from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 to 75,500 million is a process that has not been compared in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus fall in line with the Basel Treaty,” he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that “there are a number of not too happy views on the slowness of the process” that show “a lack of seriousness and understanding” because “what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on time before the end of the year.”
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the most stringent financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed "a lack of knowledge" to those who doubt it.
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" with regard to financial institutions and also the system, which has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was very successful in the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets triggered a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed a new adaptation measure, from the reduction of tax for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediation agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for the unemployed without pay, to the privatization of the state.
Vice-President Elena Salgadov<0xC3><0xA1>, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for triggering the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
It should be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which contradicts the idea of respecting the old traditions that a large part of the other members hold.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would be part of Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to March – although it may now seem like a scifi, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to restructure the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigour, fines for guilty states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
Germany’s position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no room for pickups.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission instigated deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered to be correct (fiscal rigor and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by these Central European countries, when Merkel painfully discussed the decision on Greece’s rescue.
It has already been the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against Greece’s rescue.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel once again came up with a clear opinion when she called for reform of the European Union conventions in order to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time to have private creditors to bear part of the cost.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved, and in the coming months we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, even though we now need to take measures that he seems to disagree with too much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will represent the creation of a new monetary zone in which states that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report a postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is showing us that we must take a strict path of growth by increasing the rate of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on receivables and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that Spain’s governments in the years of the growth boom, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand it.
It is not just a matter of restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities they give us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this, and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, through criticism of Merkel’s address, the path of thought has opened.
However, the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not too serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that they warned us.
Sport and bypassing the rules
The finches Alonso and Ramos performed in a match with Ajax show a joke not an intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergia Ramose) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea of ink to be written on whether this is non-sporting behaviour, and whether UEFA should not have phoned after the match.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) the named players intentionally wasted time one after the other at a time when the foul was to be played to provoke the referee, and the latter showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending in their group at the head - and will be able to get rid of the cards, continue to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA disciplinary commission awarded coach José Mourinho a penalty for two matches and the guilty players received a fine.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are not written, but are followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that its participant was the team of Real Madrid (who in his anthem boasts nobility and honor, and who already penalized for similar acts of his players), and, as it seems, also thanks to the epitome of the next.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is circumvention of the law in these acts; it is indeed an action that respects the rules of sport, the meaning of which is, however,
It is decided what kind of harm such behavior affects the sporting spirit.
One of the duties of sporting behavior is the physical inviolability of the opponents, which has not been violated in these cases, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these duties that characterize a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opponent's team due to their offense - which has not happened here either.
So the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as a leash or circumvention of the law did not occur, there was no covert violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as visible as possible with the aim of punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
The other question, however, is what benefit the perpetrators of their deliberate offense will have.
Here it is necessary to note that the opponent does not get into the disadvantaged position, and that in the current match no benefit is achieved, since the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and beyond this, the players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which the first round is not enough to rule out one of my cards.
So as the wheels will continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, the part of which is to make a strategic decision that will allow you to get the maximum benefit under the rules.
in the case that we are dealing with here, the players were not intended to avoid the award of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather they chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without evading the punishment or running away from it.
Although the boundary between a joke and circumventing the rules is not quite clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a joke.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the transmission of instructions to provoke them from the leadership took place.
Damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Fighting offers for the organization of Christmas parties in Barcelona
The Dictate of the Calendar concentrates this year’s avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a fast increase in the celebration paid by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, there are again pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, the associations have led the sector to subjugate the Eurozone to the fight for customers, and the price has been reduced by 20.
To complete the complication of numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated the application for a week from December 13, creating a lava of bookings for days at the peak (16th and 17th), while in the previous week it was not nearly a week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the slender years began, there are many companies that cancelled collective parties for budget reasons.
In order not to leave the tradition, many employees pay their expenses at parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices on the border of tolerance, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restaurac<0xC3><0xAD>o de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
At the moment, the representative of the patronage of restaurants does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will change their mind before making a reservation."
“They want to go out, but when it comes to prices, they’re careful,” he adds.
Shops will go well for those "who will offer quality and good service at a favorable price", he says, recalling that due to the crisis, customers tend to go downwards and the majority of customers now want to spend about 25 euros.
Surveys at various facilities show that the largest number of requests for a reservation is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom of bookings this Friday, with most requirements being for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adapted by the offered menu, the total prices of which are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another significant company, which is Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar more early bookings, and this already since the beginning of November.
“We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, which should each choose from, range from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQuQu and counts 23 companies in total, they remain optimistic after seeing profit growth since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
Sources of this company emphasize that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they noted the tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - late).
They also noted that companies are already emerging, which again invite their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Enric Goma, Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centers in Barcelona) believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings has "resurrected" even though clients "contract to the maximum".
This impression did not fade even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused great unrest in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
WikiLeaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, published by Wikileaks, confirms the extraordinary unrest that arouses the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details that they offer about the content of the communications and thoughts of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states rather than the states as far as they are concerned with nuclear security, rather than assimilate from them, is "increasing to the point of the situation."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not dismantled, but stored after work to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the Taliban's control" and the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials.
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile-controlled program is no longer seen only by the US, but also by Russia, as spreading and representing a reason to be aware.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with a strict religious belief to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear weapons or missile-controlled internships," said the expert from the US Department of Defense, Yuri Korolev.
The biggest news document published by Julian Assange’s server is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
Depeche, issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," says: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of help remain unanswered or are rejected."
In the next report, Peter Lavoy, an employee of the National Intelligence Service for South Asia, states that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other state in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also asked Washington to “make it very clear” during General Ashfaq Kayani’s visit that the “Pakistani army must cease silent support for terrorist groups.”
She's the boss of WikiLeaks.
Obama appoints a high-ranking employee in charge of counterterrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol is issuing a “red call” to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced an “extraordinary challenge,” the so-called red note, to “locating and tracking the movement” of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but is dated November 20.
It has nothing to do with the recent leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks creator Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was on 20 November that the International Police Corps, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries have instructions to Interpol to identify or locate Assange "with the aim of imposing a temporary link on him and issuing him".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organization explained, consider the so-called red notice to be an option to carry out arrests - this must be ensured by the national component of the police - in particular, if it is to be held by the police.
The move was exacerbated by Assenge’s lawyers, who published a paper yesterday, stating that the thirty-nine-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through a video conference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the legendary Lavrentius Pavlovich Berija, the head of Stalin’s security.
“This is a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
While the whole world is looking for him - and his mother is defending his son's innocence from Australia - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine — in this interview he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to carry out espionage at the United Nations and thus violate international conventions signed by the United States, she should step down,” he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who called the demand for the demise "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a high-ranking counter-terrorism officer, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, asked the foreign ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations, “so that anyone who contributes or otherwise assists can be intervened and prosecuted.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went on to say that Assange should be “killed,” which he subsequently had to resign.
"Obama should write a reward on him or use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for president.
“Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for leaking information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” he said.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in the ERC by "deadening" on supporters of Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuation.
Huguet proposes multiple executives and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s apparently found a recipe for fighting a number of internal uprisings in the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) series, unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his gesture regarding the demise seems insufficient to the supporters of the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Caroda-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as its leaders themselves, and that he absolutely cannot do for him with such a care.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to gain new criticisms by means of a blackout that will help him turn to the municipal elections.
First, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the nationwide committee will be able to make a secret statement about his continuing in office.
With ballots, not by raising your hand.
If supporters of Caroda want to pass a criminal vote on to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid crushing and subjugating his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one additional vote, but added, without specifying a percentage, that he would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make his office available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the largest organ at the congresses.
But since they don’t have enough majority to force demises, they will try to executiveally recall the plan from now until May.
As a result, they expect to participate in the drafting of a document on strategic reorientation, on which the leadership can vote on the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for promising to move Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that "multi-voice" undermines stability, and that his goal is for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, there seems to be a significant article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s' ideologue, this innovation advisor took it as a matter of course that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named them five, out of which two stand out.
The first is the "recomposition" of the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means also include new faces who are from the Carod-like sector.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC end completely by meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates selected by voting.
Ending the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
However, the 2008 Controversial Assembly decided that the meeting must be judged at a special congress on the reform of the statutes.
This matter is still unresolved, as the situation within the party reflected the resolution of the matter.
Now, without the cluttering of critical sectors, it might be a good time to re-examine this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, there are a total of 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a body in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a grace wound to the head, and had hands and feet tied to the rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the trunk of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n Colony, in the Naucalpan District.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, co-workers discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots into the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the area of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a report signed by the probably criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight gunshots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two 30-year-old victims were killed in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, the body of a man shot in the forehead was found, and a 25-caliber ammunition gun was found underneath the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewage canal in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
The rescue files did a thorough search for other parts of it, but they did not find them.
The residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n reported the discovery of a body with hands tied back and wrapped in the head at the site of Pena Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound to the backrest.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza was reported, the victims also found reports threatening death.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the Los Reyes district of La Paz.
in a nearby colony was found the rest of the body, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bedding in the village of Zoquiapan in the Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning a dead man was found in Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, which was identified as a precursor to his bedsheet, according to a report by Maricha.
In Ixtapuluca, a woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla settlement with no signs of life, with two wounds in the abdomen.
On the woman's skin was discovered the tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - ozn.) and also necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads wrapped in tape were found, and a report was also found at them, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In the case of the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, stating, "This will happen to those who don't adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found bearing signs of torture and had bound limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n colony.
The last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first was sacked and found in the colony of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and was packed in black plastic bags, tied with a tape and had a message left with him; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic package in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Along with him, agents also found a ticket with a message.
China is meeting its goal of reducing greenhouse gases.
The country’s representative at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, COP16, assured that its country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and said it insists on its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will deliver on its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made an immense effort to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He said China’s climate change strategy is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity-building, institution building, and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, he has already made progress, including last year’s approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
He also stressed that in China, the federal authorities worked in coordination with the provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reductions.
Furthermore, various multi-year plans, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries, are in progress or have already been completed, he said.
For example, it is, as he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been put in place over the last five years and received investment from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change, the project of replacement of fluorescent bulbs and the project of mitigation and adaptation are also underway, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert advisor on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he outlined, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent in China 6 tons, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share in emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The President of the National Action Party (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional, Czech: N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> aktion<0xC3><0xA1>n strata - ozn.) stated that the former president of this party is entitled to claim his rights from the National Ordinary Commission.
The National Chairman of the PAN party, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legal, and that the former president of the party is entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and demand his right.
In an interview taken before the objection was raised by the governor of the state, Gabine Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina was in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Ordinary Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the General Commission of the National Council for a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she was never at the negotiating table for the Alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The PAN president said 71 years of dialogue are behind him, and that is why "internal competitiveness does not cure us, on the contrary, we benefit from it and it strengthens us," he added.
He said the committee could choose the best president or chairperson it deserves for the next three years without debate, so it handed over the staff to the "whom the committee will appoint".
"So I'm absolutely calm and relaxed, and I'm proud to hand over the office of the party president to any of the five."
He predicted that the rise that the party had seen in the last elections in July would be reflected in future clowns, although "there is still no time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabina Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "they are placed in them a lot of expectations and aspirations".
When we asked him about the criticisms of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech: Partido Revolucionario Institutional) for his speeches during the four years that he has been ruling, César Nava urged the members of the Presidential Council of Gorll<0xC3><0xA1>n and the Presidential Council to think about the PRI.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Clader<0xC3><0xB3>n, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their misery," he said.
He stated that the head of the federal executive power has the right to express himself as he did during a speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no use of laziness or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes law to support undocumented students on Twitter
“If you think that passing the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama, in a post on his personal Twitter account, joined a national mobilization to support the Dream Act, which is supposed to legalize students without documents.
“If you think it’s right to pass the Dream Act, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His short report points to an internet link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately contact the senators as the vote on the bill is approaching.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he said.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new nuclear-weapon proliferation treaty with Russia, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other bills, the presidential spokesman said he believes that once the fiscal issue is resolved, it will be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, so a bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though it is true.
The senatorial approval of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have been in the country for the past five years, and have been admitted to a higher education institution or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, so they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters are carrying out intense agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the law.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the bill.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most, are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as retired Florida Senator George Lemieux, who supplemented the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have stated that they will no longer support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed his opinion.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning towards a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature put a finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in the wound" is like the Czech "cut the nail on the head - ozn.
The second round of the Pleasure of Language cycle was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... a finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure in the language, a cycle that will be rounded to the table as if to celebrate the literature written in the Spanish language.
The finger to the wound "brings us to the closet", said the Argentine writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to listen to this debate of the Montém<0xC3><0xAD>el and the fashion of the Montessori, with the Mar<0xC3><0xAD>go, at the round table.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celori, and which Schultz later described as a great story in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist, who, in search of the knowledge of what "wound" is, walks from the doctor to the doctor from which she is not cared.
The infectologist goes on to say, “Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound.”
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals this secret: "the wound represents the really open and thus the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist was relieved and concluded that "in the morning she managed to learn only so much that it was really open and that it does not exist", but gained the conviction that pleasure and guidance in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also spoke with a delightful story called Praise the Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but will appear in a moment.
with elements of magical realism, the narrator tells the story of the famous wizard who played the clouds, brought back the people who went far, or corrected the honor lost by a virgin, this story which he turned to his own, the narrator turned to the narrator, the narrator is to speak to the American, the narrator, the great novel,
“Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the fake testimonies that were presented as real in the stories, but in no other way was he ever able to tell the story of America with such imaginativeness that even the study lacked.”
However, he emphasized, “they are fools and liars who have more imagination” and it is precisely where reality and lie merge, where it is no longer known what belongs to one group of stories and what belongs to the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
"Thanks to his reference, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair made possible with her word “Finger in the Wound”.
A Cuban-Portuguese writer pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that goes through her country — and is shared by Latin America — and is the result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise, which of course is not intended," she said, after stating that the reality of literature is a communication and a dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader.
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger to the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and in the control of consciousness that overwhelms dogmatisms, he forgets that "behind every temptation there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes."
“To be masters of our thoughts and our realities, we have to color: and to color means many times to put a finger in the wound and to trouble those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think that the world is to prefer the world in cartoons, the black and white, the underworld, the author, the fixed ideas and the unwritten.”
Romano is going for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, experienced both good and bad during his career, but has already managed to achieve three times in a decisive series.
in the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, in addition, they face two different styles that stand out with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he experienced both good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve already on three occasions in the decisive series, but until now he left with the unfortunate, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinarily for him.
The Argentine had to settle for the silver medal, remained one step behind the winner, and curiously played with the same team in the following finals.
As a coach, the Santist<0xC3><0xAD> strategist reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura, when he was in the hands of the club Morelia, with whom he defeated a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he again advanced to the decisive duel and also a 3–1 loss to him.
Already with the Santos Laguna club in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "D<0xC3><0xA1>bols" of Toluca, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Uzen<0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xB5>es" (his team's last name was a one-off st<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xAD> str<0xC3><0xAD>i str<0xC3><0xAD>i st<0xC3><0xAD>o from Deportivo Toluca, he didn't from 2 hro hroz st<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>k) after 2 minutes.
Ruben has already lost two finals against Toluca's "Red Devils" and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that the most important institution is for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
in living memory has a previous final, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned that until the referee has written the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be prepared to take action, and we must be prepared to take the asses, as well as to take the players, because last time, we would agree with two penalties, we are
But he doesn't worry that this series might take place in the penalty shootouts, he believes in his players: "We never try to make a series of penalty shootouts, you try to end up in normal time, but we'll end up in the usual time, but we'll end up in the usual time, but sometimes there'll be no other option in the penalty shootouts, and we'll have to be ready for it.
Romano has in his hands the chance to stop being the second and taste the glory that the titles bring for the first time.
The United States is changing the rules for the issuance of visas
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Service centres before an interview with the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the process of negotiating visas at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services (abbreviated from ASC) centres before an interview with the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will collect the biometric information of the applicant and will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of handling the visa will be lower, there will no longer be a fee to arrange a meeting, the second to process the request and the other to deliver the document by a transport service.
The applicant will only pay a single fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary workers visas) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and will be stripped of their fingerprints.
Since biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the interview at the Consular Department will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that it would present a "discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life", sparking speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in uninhabitable conditions that have been considered uninhabitable, and that could represent the possibility that someday they will become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life might exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that it is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life different from the one we know".
The Space Agency will announce the actual scope of the discoveries at tomorrow’s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists exploring Titan (the largest moon on Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the advent of “bipartisanism,” they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not even been started in <0xC4><0x8C>u<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>k<0xC3><0xA1>, where the opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by members of the parties of the PRD (Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3>n Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tica, Czech "Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3>n" (Partido del Trabajo), PT (Partido del Trabajo) and <0xC5><0xA0>l<0xC3><0xA1>m (Parti) - Czech "Parti (Parti<0xC3><0xA1>n).
Prior to the start of the 60th parliamentary session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo were "gracious" against the reform of the Constitution, as they were expelled.
With this reform, they repeated, Bavarianism begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will rule Congress.
These four members, together with Glori<0xC3><0xAD>a Margarita Santos Aquilarov<0xC3><0xA1>, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brit from the PAN (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n, Czech for "National Action Party", Vici<0xC3><0xB3>n Veci<0xC3><0xB3>n Veci<0xC3><0xB3>n Vezi<0xC3><0xA1>r C.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute a political marginality from the demands of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech: "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN parties.
He clarified that over the next few days, they will talk to representatives of PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subject to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
“When I got here [the opposition coalition], that’s what I’m looking at, because we’re excluded from any decision, not even willing to consider the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from the Convergence, said that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and will therefore form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued, that Congress after it was monopoly, was now "duo-pole."
The aspiration for law reform is not to have endless bipartisanship in Congress.
The group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, added Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT explained that at the moment Congress has become a "choice" of two - in an appeal to the PAN and PRI parties.
"In the past it was dominated by only one side, today it is divided by two."
Patron Montalvo requested that the Member's personality be respected, so that he could be placed at the negotiating table.
"For the five of us, who are likely to be nine, but just now see us in the five, not to be left out because of the winged agreements, each in a different faction, we have united ourselves to make it a point to reform, and to make it a point to reform, because it is a problem."
Another 200,000 pesos is issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n will pay another cheque to the discussed owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the mayor Lorena Guadalupe to Camacho Palazuelos.
This will increase the amount paid to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material in the second half of the year to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, the last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, was issued at a rate of 200,144,56 pesos and was listed as the subject of "balance of unpaid payments".
Registrar Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office due to high-priced sales, another proceeds.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will be sent in favor of Camacha Palazuelos.
"Nothing was purchased now, it only pays what we owe it, as well as to other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "resurrected" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last on November 16.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Paper, as stated by the law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office, to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Registrar assured the Registrar that they did not re-use the services.
In the previous period, after 25 July, the newspaper Noroeste published a review of checks issued by the mayor to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the period of more than three million years of the mayor of Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourists are in need of maintenance.
Tourism managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada residence in Mazatlan.
After the fall of foreign tourists into the depths of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada mansion, the tourism sector in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Zona Dorada area, recalled that they have repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and this is the bad thing that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and pedestrians affects tourists who walk around and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to shut down a business for a day, and they don’t have an idea of the sales they’re avoiding, otherwise they wouldn’t have dealt with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
"The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not just to fix existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because as residents we deserve clean housing, the city council should change its strategy of maintenance of the city."
There are also other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Emblem of Mazatlan and El Venadito (monument, deer statue - pozn.
"Today, in order for tourists to arrive, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city full of cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
“The necessary attention has not been given here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He spoke of a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the mayor, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and orderly in order to be attractive, because it has tourist potential.
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, sub-secretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is urgent, because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Luckily, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, but we will need to put these places in order first to attract them and to be able to put them on the list we have for the promotion of this destination."
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Davalos, president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a big responsibility by setting an example in finding a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges that the state faces.
A parliamentary period of full decent work and no agreements between the parties and the state executive is demanded by the business sector in Mazatlan, because Sinaloa is in trouble and faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary session has started, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Davalaos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the way to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival pilgrims of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary interlocking, which would move the prevailing forward in order.
“We want them to do a decent job and be committed to society and sectors, because it was Sinaloa’s people who gave them their voice in previous elections.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all efforts to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in a certain way support the creation of jobs."
As for tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that this is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing in currencies and investment, which in addition directly rivals agriculture."
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with security and help with the alcohol law, which has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
The Three Kings Are Looking For
Dolls, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the children's wish list in the family of Coronad Valenzuela.
For their parents, it will be difficult to fulfill their imaginations about the coming holiday of the Three Kings, as their household counts exactly 12 people and one raven.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest apartment in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
“Sometimes it’s hard because my husband isn’t lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon, I go out with the beetles on the street to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, a mother of children.
A four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, Cayetana would have wanted clothes the size of one year.
“He said to me [José Alfredo] ‘I wish I had this monster car,’ but I told him ‘we’ll see my son,’ because it was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled.
For older children who were just in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaiah is a size 10, and eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six would be a good fit.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the family of Coronad Valenzuela, you can participate in the campaign "Seeking Three Kings", and at the reception of the newspaper Noroeste bring a gift or cash.
14 suspected drug traffickers who have been arrested.
A dozen inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to manufacture drugs.
“Approximately 750 ounces of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce were seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both believed to be the bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to enter the courthouse in Sherbrooke after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, holding it for the purpose of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These examinations were subsequently carried out after a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests," Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the Regional Investigation Department of the City of Estrie, the State Police of Quebec, the State Police of Sherbrooke and the Sherbrooke Memphis Magog Police Administration.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The draft law of conservatives, which the government said should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand straight on the side of the party that built the gum under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly session of the du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as it is proposed, would violate Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a bill that would allow for up to a year’s detention of any person from a ship identified as carrying an illegal immigrant.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he cannot support the bill because it is heading towards a wrong goal.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD critic Olivia Chow has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“Neo-Democrats agree to take action against illegal immigrant smugglers and that’s what we consider to be the main part of another bill, C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative Bill because it blames refugees and puts children in jail for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the opposition parties.
“Canadians are telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada on the fly and treat it like some kind of patholytic.”
They expect Canada to take consistent action, said Minister Kenney.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every member who opposes it would be held accountable to his or her constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigative commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying to make this idea not to be forgotten: Québec plans to consult with the Department of Investigation of New York in January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That’s why Tuesday’s announcement surprised not one of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, there was no need for critic of public safety, PQ proponent Stéphane Bergeron, to classify the announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of a hat” and “an amateur solution smashed on his knees.”
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They're happy with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace setting up a hearing of witnesses in a public hearing.
“Moreover, Mr. Charest is asserting that he doesn’t want to create this investigative committee, and people think, just like you and I, he’s hiding something,” he explains.
“The only way to achieve the creation of an investigative commission is the demise of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Higher Public Officials.
In order to get out of this blind alley, he proposed to Quebec to grant special powers to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
It also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the Commissioners, who are allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government's files.
Quebec would also follow Ottawa to amend the Penal Code so that it is better adapted to this type of criminal activity.
The request would be based on the commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the judiciary for this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Secretary of State for Public Security Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to the letter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Penal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently allowed to make changes to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict scrutiny.
Several streams have come under strict control due to heavy rains that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
The two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The road is skipped.
Several regions were hit by heavy rainfall from Tuesday to Wednesday evening, i.e. rainfall between 40 and 70 millimetres.
Another 20 to 40 millimetres were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
Parts of the north of the river and the Outaouais valley were hit the most.
It could fall as much as 100 millimeters in total.
If we count these precipitations with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be concerned about flooding in some water flows.
Quebec’s rescue service issued a flood warning on Wednesday evening for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in Les Laurentides, and in Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, became the subject of flood alerts and continuous checks.
In the region of Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re, heavy watersheds caused some lakes, in Sainte-Julianne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
One interim bridge was demolished in Saint-Calixte as a result of heavy rains.
The two homes had to be evacuated preventively.
In Outaouais the spilling of some lakes off the coast caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is on standby and oversees the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued a flood warning on Wednesday for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partly
Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements pertaining to social assistance and Haitians and, as well as rude speeches.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council found that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative outsourcing of Haitians".
The Council also concluded that discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two persons who took their lives, did not violate radio broadcasting rules.
The Radio and Television Broadcasting Council received a number of complaints concerning comments made during the broadcasting, broadcasting between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following a complaint from the Quebec Joint Front of Social Support Beneficiaries.
The group complained that the amounts stated in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most members of the Commission have concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide cannot be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of Dupont's noon reports have come across a sensitive topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no smear against him.
The last dispute concerned the statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort have been involved in a media shootout that has triggered a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator stated that he did not send any donations to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that they will actually get the money they need.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative image of Haitians.
"I've already made up my three-day delay on that thing."
"My file has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use a gross statement in broadcasting.
In any case, the radio broadcaster CHOI-FM cooperated "on the basis of its responsibilities".
For a station that will, inter alia, have to notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of Kung-Fu and Montreal.
A resident of Montreal, native to Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange time.
An athlete who stands out in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing enters tatami and ringing around the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, a nymph who has been living in the capital since 2008, to learn from professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for matches all over the place because for those who don't like a game on the ground that appears in martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a guard and as an assistant for UPS, has just given his rivals bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in San Shao."
"They were invited to compete in the top four at the last World Championships in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005, I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the tournament in fifth place, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this year or beyond!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where strokes of the fist and feet, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and less often in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
No matter how Nacer Zemmal has to keep only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl in Kung Fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” explains a sympathetic guy.
"It's a bit like Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first game, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category compete to be crowned one champion, the king of kung fu."
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 450 million contracts without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed on a $450 million agreement with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which have won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project in the total amount of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, named <0xC3><0x89>nergie gerance, was authorized in 2004, in conjunction with the selection of Hydro-Québec, to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" was awarded a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint to a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and triggers price increases.
"It's a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition."
“This means that people who no longer make foreign agreements in secret are already making them openly today,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to bear how public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, protested this afternoon, repeatedly denying that it would be a collusion contract.
“I have my own way,” she muttered, arguing that the PQ was “indecency” and “lacking accuracy.”
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice all over the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, that will allow two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of scope of work.
The building is already under construction and must be dismantled by 2012.
However, the contract was recognised without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium’s engineering consultancy formula is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we go through the business registers of Québec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, namely CIMA<0x2B>, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As for the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau emphasized in particular the fact that "la Baie James territory is typical of a special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
Eastmain’s chief project manager, Réal Laporte, from Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to face the fact that the project management contract was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and there are few bidding contestants, your bidding prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: that is, you pick people who are in that contract as contestants, and that you say, "Let's make a deal with a good price."
“But the main idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people,” Mr. Laporte said.
This contract awarded to <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the Le Devoir audit, it counted 109 engineering consulting contracts, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories conducting soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin seized 22 contracts, of which Génivar acquired 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Energy Management".
All the contracts have been closed.
The total is $449,783,344, including a contract with <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known Liberal parties of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ was also associated with the companies that "financed it" before specifying that it was more about its management staff.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - "Green" Label Doesn't Boost Confidence
More green, but openly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "unbiased" brands and environmental certification, to be guided accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy in a media universe that insists on us and encourages us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe cries out for a lack of credible information, a failure to fulfil its obligations in the first place, which it qualifies as a brake on its back.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec, who try to sell them, still do not believe them too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t believe in the promise of companies regarding the environment, simply because green advertising companies find a measuring tool that was developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates affixed to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labelled as environmentally responsible, Barometer says.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be the first priority for stimulating this page of consumption revived by almost a third of Québec consumers today.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre identified, at a higher price of these products.
In fact, one-third of the population of Quebec is untrustworthy of the data on the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass by our own hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping with merchants from their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, says Barométre.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which strives to minimize the impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Barométre states: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers said they use public transport or recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in an interest.
Walking and cycling also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, agrees to take part, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer company "Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le", which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinematic complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and which proved its mission as a film art lover, failed to achieve what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the government of Quebec proposes a loan, which would otherwise be lower, some of the original expectations, which could lay the basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and resources derived from the state.
The first action plan and demand for $12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan was sent to the Minister of St-Pierre, President of the Society for Business Development in Culture (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government’s counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must indeed be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec has opposed the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, by ruling that the Minister of Culture should not finance the real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
But, on the other hand, several participants in the discussion demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinemas during ten years of film art after financing the construction of the complex himself, which may have been the reason for the change on the part of the state's financial council.
The lack of independent movie halls is rampant in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will spend $700,000 to push the acquisition.
As of spring 2009, the only of the three film companies, Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and screen the most beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not mention Le Devoir and is thus ignored, when he and his group think about the reduction proposals that are made to him.
An uplifted curtain to Canada as a whole...
The new U.S. diplomatic sources reported through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of Canadians’ inferiority to Americans, but with the same blow it reveals its sense of superiority to Canada.
U.S. diplomats are therefore amazed that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to vote, and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, issued yesterday to the public, provide additional sensitive details to get each other “under the skin.”
The communication, dated 22 September 2008, that is, in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets that political leaders are discussing.
To the great admiration of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives a number of explanations for this situation.
“Canada’s almost-excellent undervalued complex predisposes perhaps political leaders to talking about domestic bets, rather than realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
“The United States is, therefore,” he concluded, “a proverbial elephant in these elections: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about them.”
The ambassador understands this "listening silence" less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It’s logical that the ability of a candidate, party, or even better the head of the party to lead these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the election.”
Other expressions of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s preservation in the confidence vote in early February, regarding the federal budget to which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30-$40 billion recovery plan.”
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas parliamentary session so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that opposition parties are conditioned on their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, points to Washington’s increasingly negative image of the United States being cast on CBC’s dramatic series.
The ambassador is concerned by the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too obscure references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent CIA interrogations can be observed.
Another report mentions that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the principle of "case by case".
At the conclusion of the meeting, it reads, "some paper was handed over, concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State."
"The Secret Service agreed to revise the file."
Finally, let’s note that people who refer to WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “destroyed.”
It was reported and Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World Lighting Renewal Plan
In Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n, the United Nations proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, commercial lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries with the goal of achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) limitation, which corresponds to nearly one-third of the additional limitation that needs to be achieved by 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the United Nations wants to pursue in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the lack of hard-to-reach commitments to reduction on the part of industrialized countries.
According to yesterday’s plan, if the ignited bulbs, which still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, we will replace them with fluorescent bulbs or, even better, bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a significant amount of 8 billion tons would be emitted from the planet.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world’s emissions.
That's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from a fleet of cars across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 gigabytes to 49 gigabytes.
But it will be necessary to deduct another 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve stabilization of climate warming at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to rule out not getting out of control.
In light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dispersed in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With Fluorocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we reduce this consumption by two more times.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, which Philips introduced this week - the company is said to have participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a filamentary light bulb, which would turn on the ground and give us an idea of a possible 100 times.
All of these new bulbs can also work with reosts and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent lamps because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection plants.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluorocompact bulb, but rather thermal coal power plants, which release a lot of mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in ignited bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants put 25,000 tons of mercury into circulation each year.
The report also details the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost 2.5 billion.
The Ivory Coast is looking forward to the election results.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate release of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent election commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results," a spokesperson for the President of the United Nations said.
“It calls on all parties in the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressures from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed the earliest date to pass - Wednesday midnight - without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's shutdown.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of CEI confirmed on television that the commission was “continuing to work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls around the world for CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between retiring Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattar.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for the “fraud” vote in the north, which is managed by the former rebels of the New Army (UN) since the unsuccessful coup d’état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the head of the Ivory Coast presidential election campaign, confirmed that the intimidation maneuvers practiced by the UN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged supporters of the Ivory Coast president from going to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the grievances Gbagbo filed.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any association with former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential election, held on Sunday, was considered to be the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been split in two halves for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political faction that it could be held accountable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round on 31 October, as the winner with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassana Ouataru, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter of the year.
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by the provisional data with the correction of seasonal deviations from the IEE (CVS).
Unemployment has risen to 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed for 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
On a broader scale, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they are looking for work or not.
The current situation of young people in the labour market has escalated further with a new increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (<0x2B> 0.9 points for three months, <0x2B>0.5 points for one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, there were 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24, according to the International Labour Office.
As for seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (<0x2B>0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), i.e. 482,000 people from 50 years of age and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 had a benefit from unemployment stability of 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point for three months, <0x2B>0.1 point for one year) and 8.8% in all France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to compile monthly statistics and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after a figure of 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and jailed
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of the waste-processing companies and brother of PS of the Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into the case of a public smuggler.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of misuse of the company’s assets, abuse of public funds and public property, concealment, payment of bribes, receipt of bribes for the purpose of influencing the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, not any delusions."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a lot of criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP.
Mr Guérini, through his lawyers, stated that he had sent a brief message to the judges before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
When it comes to the award of contracts or the allocation of funds associated with their operation, he never knew anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was accused on Wednesday of misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and released, under judicial supervision, the protagonists of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that are touched on him."
"The investigating judge will look into it and let it go," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
Four others were charged and released on Tuesday night, with two of them being under judicial scrutiny, prosecutor Michel Raffin said, according to Reuters.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director-general with elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for receiving bribes in order to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are accused, one of "the alienation and abuse of the company's assets", the other of "the conspiracy to abuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "secret abuse of the company's assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to launder money from a massive gangster.
The investigation is carried out in the course of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the closing of public procurement, in particular in the matter of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities in the Municipal Municipality of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée Palace exaggerates Syria mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for “spionage”, consolidated views in France, brought diplomacy into combat readiness and stressed the relationship.
All this is closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
The American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the U.S. judiciary for the underground jammering of material.
Finally, they expose to a sharp light the way the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't actually do anything about it.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 reads: "Iran: French comments on how to solve the case of hostages".
The advisor to the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same in order to be transported back to their own country by the violence held in Iran.
"Make the noise," they say, "constantly pronounce the words "in the media" fundamental human rights, "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into trouble, sensitive to its image.
“Do it the more they’ll ask you to stop doing it.”
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, “silence will solve nothing”, the Iranians are “masters of avoidable maneuvers.”
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day the French embassy will give her asylum) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (cash <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>230,000).
And he will announce that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will be sharpened".
The Iranians “could arrest about 1,800 more French people living in Iran in the future,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left the prison 12 days ago, but she is still locked up in Iran.
Information is circulating: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States declares has been expelled for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material for the nuclear program, the spread of Majid Khakavanda is bad news.
Did France accede to the treaty?
The Liberation of the Iranian for the Liberation of the Young Frenchwoman?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, was not only "shocked by this judge's decision", but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There were talks between the presidential office and the minister of justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the “limited” supervision of the French intelligence service.
The advisor of the Elysée Palace dials the phone number, hangs the phone headphones, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of the arrest of Klotilda Reissova in Iran, the Elysée Palace is developing efforts, negotiating, through communism and organized "units" into the media, to convince that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influential" role.
Americans observe this activity not without irony and find that manipulation bears fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes a media "bright" of French officials.
What is the basis for such a measure of "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their full-fledged statement, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysian Palace to pay in this fiction.
“Intensive communication is aimed at validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
The policy, which was implemented in 2008, "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labelled premature and undeserved".
By “exceeding the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can serve when it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “send a grain of contention between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided himself to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it may be."
"But we thanked them anyway."
“This should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy takes her to the Elysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in the liberation of our country”.
End of the online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called the "Pecival" that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight for people under 16, the officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary for their health and their right to sleep to be ensured," Jo Rin, the ministry's chief official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it, added the responsible employee.
It will also provide free programs to people who request it, allowing you to limit your time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intense use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is the undisputed champion in the world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday set up the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a top politically motivated selection, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk going ahead of technical criteria.
It is certain that the 2018 FIFA Royal Competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The Championship in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to succeed in conquering new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continuing to settle into the United States (Corea, South East).
The list of individuals participating in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, the leading government representatives of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create a world of politics and the economy.
Negotiations behind the scenes are at risk of going on until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contain the best arguments, as well as documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee within the hour set for the vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelations leading to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed her country’s chances, the dug-up dike that so far hosted the world championship only once, a year.
The BBC set the crown on Monday when it broadcast a document that "stamped on the spindle" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA dissatisfied and bring the English leader into trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes he will succeed in repeating the move that his predecessor, Tony Blair, succeeded in winning for London's 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice for England to add a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the couple Spain-Portugal do not lack the trumpets of the already prepared stadiums, its well-being (World Championships in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against Englishmen and doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move the championship to Curitiba and has publicly declared "dishonest competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal remarks barely advanced on the accusations of the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Mr. Putin said.
For 2022, they seem to be a logical favorite of the United States with their considerable experience from 1994.
The world’s highest-performing economy, the headquarters of Fifa’s main sponsors, seems to have made a big leap ahead of Japan and South Korea, which, separately, prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem to be premature for both countries, which together passed the "exam" in 2002.
Another threat: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which China desperately wants, has made Asia’s chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out a big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could gamble for TV’s (due to time shifts) paid by European countries, which is a driving force for FIFA.
Second Mandate: Evidence (certainty)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand aroused the feeling that he hesitated.
Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But apparently, it is not in good agreement with the participation in the secrecy associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if the doubts persisted.
In one sense and the other.
In 2006, as one would like to believe, Jacques Chirac's friends demanded that the third term of office not be excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy said he would “decide sometime in the fall of 2011.”
As he reminds members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" sat in a little feverish state.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far away.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement from him, not a statement.
It’s not the first time he’s reminded of the humorous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or at best, you have seven and a half years ahead of you," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking of the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate less.
If they make comments, it's because of the double truth.
Acceleration of the path to the candidacy for the PS, on one side.
But it's not the entrance to Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal's piston, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convince himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to organize into combat teams rather early than intended.
Wrong search on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon over the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," the people from the immediate vicinity of the prime minister reacted cautiously.
"If he believes in possible defeat, he will not run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“He’ll still believe he can win,” corrects Alain Juppé, who is well-balanced.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Central Board of Governors in the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be terminated by the end of this year.
The crisis of Europe’s sovereign debt binds the Institute for the Issuance of Securities will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation today already so tense in the European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the active role played by the European Central Bank in resolving the debt crisis of European states.
She didn’t want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example, by increasing their program of buying overridden bonds.
"I appreciate my consideration for my European partners . . ."
The night before, in Brussels, in his hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and he "satisfied" with the remarks that the program has been delayed.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will keep its basic unchanged interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of bonds from the cash register carried out by the European Central Bank have doubled in the last week to almost 1.35 billion euros.
And thanks to the misunderstanding of the negotiators in the market, yesterday she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the central banks have purchased the Eurosystem for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market negotiators that anticipation of continuing purchases will allow for any doubt (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in the course.
If the operations of loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, the latter shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquidity on generous terms and for a duration of from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in a meaningful way."
“If not, it would take the risk of triggering a short-term new strain,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive output reported in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” says Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, “the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the dull market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to the euro-area sovereign debt markets, it has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
“It needs, at all costs, to compensate for the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent a ripple in the performance paid by the countries that are among the most fragile,” a senior bond manager said in a statement.
Because if interest rates go up, the states will be more concerned about reducing their debts, rather than stabilizing it.
It's a rescue of the euro at this price.
Berlusconi's government backs back in Italy
After the start of the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed, yesterday with a 10-year bond interest backflow.
Return to Temporary Calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the regions said they heard Giulia Tremonti calling the situation "unresolved" and that he expects an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then participated in dementia.
In any case, Tuesday’s deviation from Germany’s long interest rate reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of bankruptcy risk hedge contracts (CDS) rose to 263 points, causing some turmoil in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said he was “too busy” with “turbulent market developments” and a possible contagion of Irish origin.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and unobtrusive fiscal revenues, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget, which is available to the Senate for its analysis, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the government deficit will represent another 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (versus 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation for a new set of supplements to the state budget proposal, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
"If necessary, new, stringent measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the time being, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, a member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, not short-term or long-term, because, despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required by other countries," notes PacoOC.
It remains a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion for a vote of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and then elections to be held at the end of March could begin.
This would start a period that would be unsuitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the whole day and night, they are obviously very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s recorded expansion of interest on European government bonds has brought water to the mills for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, a target that is most focused on various speculations.
“Because in May there is a real under-transparent and obvious policy, based primarily on banking systems,” says economist Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is running slower than market time.”
Aware of this disrupted context and the danger it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
Considering the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin Group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Fund for Finance (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, denied a trip in Singapore to Asia on Tuesday, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this journey is not to raise funds, it is preparing a safe ground to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
The U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States will support any increase in mobilized funds by additional direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, in particular as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that align with stringent measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid took a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, applying for international assistance even before they apply their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on the structural reforms necessary to re-establish lasting trust in each other.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of markets with sovereign bonds.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to retrace the stock of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is an actor in the very first plan of trade in Europe’s sovereign debts, say an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, “preferably” in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The instrument exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has been awarded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and find: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snowy areas are still causing transport difficulties, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties have an orange emergency from now on due to the risk of snow and snowfall.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and la Vienne have joined 20 districts that already have an orange emergency, 18 already from Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later that night.
According to the Météo France, significant snowfalls cause problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and weak snow on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is large enough to cause transport difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, some counties have banned the passage of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and the police recommend to leave with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the traffic of some trucks has been canceled for that day.
In Picardie, school connections were banned on Thursday.
No special measures are envisaged to limit freight traffic on Wednesday evening.
The district authority "calls all drivers of cars to be as cautious as possible on the roads and to adapt the driving nature of the ticket".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that passengers, who use air transport services, connect with their company.
In the UK, Gatwick airports in southern London and Edinburgh airports in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernization of transport to Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we recall 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the state announced a grant of 4 billion euros.
Theoretically, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for the contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms established to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and the increase of the tax from the office on Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The profit from this interest rate is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for the office, which already exists, "to be modernised to increase the profits obtained from it and to affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
Too crazy.
It is not numbered in the text.
We've got four billion miles to go.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are connected to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital grants that will be mobilized by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
"From the moment we created revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then go up to 4 billion," he explained.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will not be allocated until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised $4 billion belongs to the still absent subscribers, runs the risk of triggering a somewhat disturbing parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Revenge Hackers and Influential Scouts
The case of WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a regression-controlled future.
But let's follow the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (any nation) consists solely of press cuts.
"Extraordinary revelations" by Americans about Berlusconi's way of sex life are announcing what everyone has been reading in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi's own), and despite the fact that Gaddafi's caricature profile has long been a pro-Cabrete for a long time.
The rule that secret documents should consist only of messages already known is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Butlers) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to look for new information (not even know where to look for messages about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, lazy (or limited-minded) head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be an editor in the Libération newspapers) who considers only what he himself admits to be true.
The high-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the state resort was the same that Newsweek published a week earlier.
Why, then, was there so much confusion about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War and since the heads of state can call or fly the transformative planes to a common dinner, they have lost their diplomatic function in a small recession, and they have lost their diplomatic function since the end of the Second World War.
Any viewer watching movies about the investigation very well knows that it is only out of hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public obliterates the obligation of hypocrisy and sheds a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not negligible, to the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "executors".
But let's get to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, it was possible to perceive all power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, the citizen became a complete victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate how it works now, that even the “graves” with the most secret information of the powerful cannot withstand the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker – elected as a citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets be maintained?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret of Wiki is a contentless secret (and the contentless secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel would be a lifeless secret to him; indeed, a secret without content, because it is revealed by Hill.
WikiLeaks did not make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of spared power be so significant?
It is clear that in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be equivalent to its publication on a poster glued on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies it is useless to hope that it can be kept secret messages over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with some of his colleagues.
How will it be possible to keep private and sensitive messages secret in the future?
I know that for the moment my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government agents who discreetly transport themselves to fulfill formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry with them only those messages that they know to memorize or rather hide in secret.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-closed drawers: overall, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a wired telegraph (telephone).
Video cassettes (analogous) allowed movie lovers to shoot the movie step by step, move it forward and backward and uncover all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digital) only allow to jump on chapters, that is, on macros.
By high-speed trains we will reach from Rome to Milan in three hours, while for the journey by plane and transport that includes we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication techniques to return to the cars drawn by horses.
One last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what lay in the secrecy of the embassy.
Now it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep the promises of fast-start financing (fast-start or early-start financing) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks have been revealed
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion for three years and France pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU has drawn a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their true value: advanced countries and civil society would like all advanced countries and civil society to do them the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, leading it on the right track to deliver on its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion pledge in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we will find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is realised without detriment to the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus in what is meant by "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has remained and it adds 150 million to the three-year fast start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment dates or with dates at the level of public development assistance.
France, on the other hand, considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for Development d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of aid granted by France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease) and must comply with its commitment to finance "new and additional" projects.
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, believe that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equal to 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for some investments that are profitable (often they are projects related to emission reductions, based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro coin, which we get as a p-value, as a p-value, a p-value, a p-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value, a-value-value--value-value------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But France can only give such a justification: it "remains" its 420 million euro commitment, of which 91.5% makes a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that makes use of the loan on such a scale.
Germany has requested 46% from this, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are complying with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfill their promise, France gives only 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful cheetah piece!
To sum up, in its "fast start" financing, France operates with a double sheikh: on the one hand, with the development of stocks in time, and on the other, with a real financial burden.
Despite spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, he is able to convince that he is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why should Member States continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and in the negotiations, because development is not progressing?
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to a series of climate debates.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its obligations and fairness and fairness towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions about investments in long-term financing (another key chapter currently being discussed): we will not avoid the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are accounted for.
France should change its stance to become as progressive with these deposits as with the rest.
So everyone is putting their hopes into the new Environment Minister, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizetta, who is coming to Cancun next week.
The shocking announcement of France’s fast-start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
A warning regarding pesticides that children will eat.
A 10-year-old child will one day eat 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex- Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the processed problematic", bought the one-bed meal between the one-bed meal and the one-bed meal in the one-bed meal and the one-bed meal in the four-bed meal.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as sugars, have been analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and more.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are among the carcinogenic substances, possible or probable, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could be disinfected by the institutes as well as by the PEs, which could act as a stimulus for the pituitary gland.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we see well that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is contagious,” she said.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk themselves contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple, imported from Brazil, listed in a study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, steaks made of ground meat, tuna in a can, and even beans and chewing gum were smeared with pesticides and other chemicals.
Analysis of the water from the tap revealed the presence of nitrogens and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was "the richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave did not evade the analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," the study concludes.
The Environmental Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed "in the face of an urgent situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the growth of civilisational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the state of the presence of 365 different pesticide residues identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
