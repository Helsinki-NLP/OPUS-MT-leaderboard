Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they "will be compared to Muppets"
The Members of the National Assembly of Wales are shocked by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of different political parties are concerned that the new name is happening ridiculously.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP is “riding on Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid party said the group as a whole was “satisfied” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was “open” to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently in the process of drafting legislation to carry out the name change, said: 'It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who make the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs proposed the Commission, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when debating the legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote whether they want to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an effort to resolve an intriguing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country would claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have difficulty
“The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
Today there is neither a café, nor a church to explore.”
He said it was understandable that cafes were gone.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly walk around.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the Church’s assets will last less than the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that will not help in the remaining refuges nearby.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by His Excellency John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Honour Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beacon.
Honourable David Johnson, the son of Honourable Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin’s, called the beard proudly ‘the bells of the poor’.
The expert who played the bait in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a treasure of culture’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bead ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bead of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin’s are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church’s ecclesiastical leaders, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of ecclesiastical leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese “would like to recalculate the costs” to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in the hiring of the architects.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Man Who Dived to Cancer in California
On Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old shark attacked a lobster boy in California who was injured.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had slept with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy scream for help and, together with some others, paddle to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was calling because he had caught a cancer, but then he realized ‘that the boy was calling, ‘I’m bitten!
I have been bitten!”
His key leg was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beachwatch Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks before, but that it had been concluded at the time that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured on the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s continues to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and establish beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 stores across the country. If they are still shopping full, they turn out to be a success in years.
The investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interiors once stood with other products.
Sainsbury’s wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also bringing its boutique makeup back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers are demanding more and more.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first is opened in Croydon, south London, the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and more and more often buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will look more and more like department stores, as the supermarket chain picks it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury’s has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food have increased as a result and the takeovers have generated more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of income from the pharmacy department in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the stores three years ago for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have completely changed the layout of our beauty department to make it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive surroundings and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "angry" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
Jones and Willoughby’s company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is outraged at Holly Willoughby for retiring at the last minute from their lucrative lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “angry” when Willoughby announced on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she was not spending enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand, through her new contracts (worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million).
The company is being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said: “Truth was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would insure its future in the long run, and deliver enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to resign.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is full of ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that leaving the presenter, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, due to large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now result in further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became Chairman of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S’ brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I’m A Celebrity program on British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones’s entourage said last night: “We have no comment on his business affairs.”
Hard language, and then there was love between us.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a remark he made that some people would find “unfit for a president” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told UN General Assembly leaders that North Korea sees no “similar response” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
The United States, meanwhile, is continuing its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the missile tests have ended, hostages have been freed, and the tangible surpluses of U.S. military have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach regarding his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people here,” Trump said as he approached the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for the launch of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it is clear that they are not seeking international help, which is difficult for us,” Ms Sumbung said.
Save the Children is building a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the foreign aid providers will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to shelter from tsunami, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
The fact that there was no tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though it was a warning of force, probably contributed to the death toll.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s wireless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is facing a lack of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the street, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool last Saturday for a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the moment his team was behind 1-0.
He tipped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He escaped the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and I dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea were at the break with 1-0, after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfield to Liverpool's playing half.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet on the midfield.
After that, he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool will play at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the Champions League group stage against Naples, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will take it on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of last Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which also caused waves of 6m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was shot dead
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, and her body showed injuries, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I want anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious or has requested to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact if they may have filmed anything via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential to our investigation.'
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, “What a bad thing!”
At 2 p.m. two police cars were inside the depot and a third was just outside.
Within the deposition, a number of agents were keeping an eye on the apartment building.
Anyone with information will be asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, citing log 247 of September 30.
Cromwell statue at British Parliament is the newest victim of the 'rewriting history' reel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on removing statues would lead to the targeting of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many believe still needs to be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is the right idea is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.
Chinese farmer kills homicidal pig
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, only known by his surname 'Yuan', was found dead at a stable in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, his artery had been pierced and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to feed pigs at a pig barn on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and it turned out that a door to a neighboring pig barn was open.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the pork chop.
A forensic investigation found that the 250 kg pig killed the farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeded and smeared,” said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu’, according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
On footage from surveillance cameras, Yuan arrived on the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
According to reports, Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have already been cases of pigs that attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring the man seriously.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
When a Oregon farmer was eaten up by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger aggression.
“They’re just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't care to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has already reached the cooler waters off the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. local time, and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which moves eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday like a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northwards, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, devastation and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, because the tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is strongly recommended to walk into the desert when a tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can kill ravines in wild rivers, and storms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rains to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of rain of 1.5 cm, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday night until Monday morning, after which the rains will be more widespread on Monday end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, temperatures in the U.S. can fluctuate sharply as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a nice example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to start hot, with temperatures fluctuating anywhere around 30<0xC2><0xB0>C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chances are high by mid-October at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on one of six television networks Thursday the incriminating testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an attack that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasts interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, to investigate the indictment for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh berated her and tried to remove her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a false testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday probably watched.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
For comparison: that’s about like for a play-off of a football game or for the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, which endorses Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office made a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down while being convicted, live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here for you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
Someone shouted, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters broadcast everything live when the Judicial Commission had to vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate hours later.
But Flake said he would only vote with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee next week, something that the Democrats of the minority insist.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘political game’ around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who had criticised her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson highlighted his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect taxes on each other was “absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooter: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later stated that he had known that he had shot Wayde as a result.
His bail is set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The bodyguard of the East Baton Rouge municipality on Friday published an interim report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for his “engagement and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “captured” and “in shock” by Waydes.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano splashes as on Mexico City
The shaft that is splashed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several times wrinkles and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ashes appeared on motorways in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit the Richter scale of central Mexico.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of Catalonia’s independence vote that divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were stopped by riot police, shelled the agents with eggs and powder paint, causing dark clouds of dust to emerge in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, riots broke out with the police, and the officers pulled their fists up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups chanted, “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions continue to escalate in the independence-minded region, a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters overwhelmingly expressed their desire to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people who are against separation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the polling station in the region, resulting in violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Friday night on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was nipt, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. After all, many of their most well-known leaders are absent from the referendum, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old monteur who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are getting higher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional detention since the end of last year, announced that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidacy for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was robbed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly stolen from a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and delivered Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he is manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win an outing during the Premiership this season. They have to record the Sunday against leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston remains undefeated, the team has already won six games in a row in his division, and coach Holt has not lost a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team had been able to make an advantage long before the first goal, after all, their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal, then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's header, shot the ball above the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers had been in possession of the ball for a long time, but the home team's defense was unmistakable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly hadn't had much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a lead from his colleagues from Livingston.
They continued to reach the penalty area of Livingston, but each time they were beaten, a penalty kick was denied twice, one after Halkett's attack on striker Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Phenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but above all Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on top of their toes throughout the match.
However, the Rangers could not break through.
Although they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed to score the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan is welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They are not even talking about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police resorted to security reasons when they invited the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car crash
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 p.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an escape crime accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were in the process of identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are rerouted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Cypriots Injured in Order Disruption
Six cypriots have been injured in a traffic jam in a heavily guarded men's prison, according to the prison's office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30am local time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialised Tornado cipiers have been deployed to resolve the situation, involving eight prisoners in one ward.
The cipiers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may need to stay behind bars longer.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison in the hospital had been treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to prison for a serious order disruption in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potential positive impacts on drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which carries flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday and it will rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely receive 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently undergoing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa's trajectory reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rains can fall in parts of Mexico, which carries a significant flood risk.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then take place on Tuesday evening through Arizona and southern Utah.
“The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening sudden flooding and devastation in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at around 4 a.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something of what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has suffered under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment process, Kavanaugh was constantly “suffering among the community, the anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before Congress and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people” saw Kavanaugh’s “beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage” that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I don’t participate, but actually I do participate,” he said.
“That’s why I come up for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “provide resistance and hinder us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll is rising
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, sweeping many of the ground as giant waves crashed on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters high hit land at the time of the eclipse. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach, they didn’t run away immediately and became the victim of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Natural Disaster Relief Agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he touched everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the Office for Natural Disaster Relief show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been destroyed and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town continued to be shaken by shocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The communication with Donggala is completely flat, we have no information at all,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying a tsunami had hit Palu, although staff said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building panicked at people on the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and buildings and cars are being swept away.
Reuters was not able to verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport is reopened for relief purposes only and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely arrived in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office seek shelter in tents of deck sail, but passed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult task of launching the emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with a high level of expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would find the lives of their loved ones, as in the miracles that people like to hear in terrible natural disasters like this one.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, aid workers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread across the paragliding community and that in the hours that followed, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey tick appeared instead of two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying cash machine in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver had just emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, the press release said, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about the identity of the perpetrators, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been briefly called Ye and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist’s name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
I switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the couple sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians. The country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, during which time leftist student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said young people often join criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
U.S. to double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this on the basis of the announcements about A.I. coming from different departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be the No. 1 in terms of AI innovations.
“Doubling the A.I. research budget would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chance that the next major accomplishment for A.I. will take place in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player of American Othello, and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China is not getting our best academics in, the companies are doing that,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years recruited the best forces from universities to work on A.I.
Lee said U.S. A.I. efforts would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Anyone who holds a doctorate in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees from academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and academic partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it would invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, U.S. legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been in the brink for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country’s name in the ‘Republic of North Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragged on for decades and would no longer be Greece’s application for Macedonian membership and EU membership.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor implies that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the accession of Macedonia to the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of such institutions as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia collapsed.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required for the name change.
The National Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent at the time, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during a referendum on the country’s name change that would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide much-needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the overwhelming majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said a “yes” as a result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made shortcuts with the defense of Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It looked like a whistle of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine top first got the ball played on the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his feet," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player taped the ball just before he was too far.
City will take it on Tuesday at 12.55 a.m. against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Germany's Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn’t make it easy for the Rockies to reach the playoffs
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoffs, there wasn’t much reason to force a new start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-offs. They currently face one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have secured at least one wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory over the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to put everything into work to secure their first division title.
“Although there’s nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’d come across this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to set Scherzer up as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the pitch field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is his normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed thrower stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, as he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but actually I do take part. That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do for it, you see the community, the acquiescence.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “provide resistance and hinder us.”
“And we’ve seen that for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “boss and common and false and lying.”
He named the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud outcry from the public.
“Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the newest in a whole series of Labour MPs who get that we are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a ‘better, softer’ policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I did, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position I would never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak for a public, whatever I say, there are shell parties on social media calling for me to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, which is jeopardising the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a Labour member.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing every day with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that severe shell parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every ‘motif of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised to keep myself engaged, not just to announce my opinion and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But that's why I didn't go into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy stances and my points of contention with the current leadership.
To those who propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves toward a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and that is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, or to refrain from acting in accordance with what I have been doing in accordance with political opportunities, will not stop me from doing so.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on his way to the top
Two late attempts may have skewed the end result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr is right to triumph in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances of winning the home team, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
“We’ve had it difficult so far during our games and we’re still undefeated, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: ‘Honor Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than us.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to an advantage over Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors' game) Melrose was able to make the numbers speak and Jason tryin Baggot was able to break it.
Climo gave Ayr an extra lead with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solory just before the rest, so it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match remained silent for a long time for a serious injury from Ruairidh Knott, who was carried off on a brancard, and once the match had restarted, Ayr was able to continue running a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then Ayr's leader Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and Melrose again counted off the extra man when no conversion followed Bruce Colvine's attempt at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson made a touch-down to the penalty-line-out behind the upcoming Ayr maul.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the catering industry, apparently he has been appointed director of a restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the “flowering restaurant business” in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s landlocked hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in a tuigage-covered marine office in La Paz.
A blue flag wafts at public buildings.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Throughout Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the coastline that the country had to abandon Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict is still alive, as is the desire to relive the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which is due to fall on October 1st after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the outcome with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the Court’s ruling on large screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of pitiful talks, is required to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, much is at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to recognise the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling only six months after the final appeal indicates that the case was “uncomplicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation has perhaps even worsened over the past four years.
“The case surrounding access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ war-torn rhetoric has all the good will that Chile might have yet to fully undermine, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point in time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
The two countries have not had an ambassador to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political crook.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Is Only Possible If It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington can’t trust it.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart the stuck nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a “utopia” that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will one day get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would abandon an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, for sale in your area soon
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to be thought out of Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations the catwalk on.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feathery wide rim, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons filled with gems, a wizard’s hat and even a pineapple, but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sewn, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than like haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The gigantic hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-meter-wide rim that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that popped up on social media everywhere also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathing suit that carried the bag.
The reddish-orange raffia bag, lined with raffy fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer. Since the designer made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have excellent service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with again a series of excellent exam results, and in addition individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for continuing and higher education, the career they choose and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired subjects exceptionally within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach out to him.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can deduce that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the barriers to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more vacancies requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that stands above the 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at present that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as ‘international communication skills.’
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James’ first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It has yet to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any games before the season to prepare for me,” he said.
Trump's election rally period in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of election rallies
It will be Trump’s first of five planned rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he likes, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the nomination of the candidate he elects for the Supreme Court vacancy has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted on in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week’s hearings for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who were extra-charged now accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallyes in the coming week were intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so important to his program that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesperson who did not want to be named told Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes might be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of chances is a fully invented sport concept, but a true player really believes in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who is currently getting the best opportunities?
“They had a six-point lead at first, and now that’s only four more, so we find that the luck is on our side right now,” Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four points, while there are still twelve at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points out of the four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he sets a good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial putt with which match four became a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His well with which she won the match at 15 was followed by a similar cry, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but wonderful European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that didn't play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to win a European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short cuts with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a lag for the Spaniard and the Swedes that they no longer came across.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you with your delay.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
The European team has played well so far and has made a nice lead over the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to go to the fight, something some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The bewitched duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, giving them four points ahead of Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the morning four-balls, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up with its lag.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, are the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After Woods and Patrick Reed entered the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who slid himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the morning four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world, with 2&1.
Yet it did not run from a lean roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 from Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to score a four-point lag at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has had enough to match, as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will “under no circumstances” disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are leading to increasing distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site for nuclear tests, and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and new technology.
"We do not see a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will not disarm unilaterally.”
Although Ri reiterated the familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea as it took further steps, it noted that he did not a priori reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had previously said.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work on the 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula', while Trump pledged no guarantees for the flea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only strengthen our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the U.S. leader did at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the other party on this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of Korea would be an impasse.
Yet Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the U.S. mainland would be targeted after ‘Mr Evil President’ Trump was a ‘missile man’ on a suicide no.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea denuclearized.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had no timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and decisively until we have achieved full, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea considered him to make “gangstar demands.”
North Korea pledged this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took “similar measures”.
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night long and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor noted that students at the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. To the best of his knowledge, this is unique in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I hearing this now, in my final year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which will be organized for the first time this year, will explain to students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a range of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, the students see an image of a dorm room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants get to hear how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know what the consequences of choosing cigarettes have on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in one night’s study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
Ensuring enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler set up the course, after all, he had been teaching at the professor last year when he was studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they get to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm to get up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult for you to sleep in.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings Gerrard's men down
The Rangers saw their match again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team had hoped for a first win in a tie since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, barely Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games. His team is now on top of the Premier's eight points away from La Hearts.
Menga scored on seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as frontier judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object at him by the visitors’ supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, passing Ayr and going to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained at the same eleven for Livingston, who managed to score a point for the Hearts last week. He would have been upset about the way his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have owned most of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They had to score already after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached leader Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow shot at the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos at least felt he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of a game, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice at the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former goalkeeper at the Ibrox, was able to easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
The Livingston Opener in the 34th minute may not be in the prolongation of the overall game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers hadn’t washed up against Jacobs’s deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-blooded and chose Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard caused a break with the changeover Coulibaly/Ryan Kent, which had almost immediate consequences when the wingman Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racete away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to step long balls.
Holt's team had been able to increase his lead in the final phase of the match, but McGregor held up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
The Rangers' striker Glenn Middleton again asked for a penalty kick at the end of the match after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other side again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can well TELL... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the geiger counter.
The guitar player has since not been thought out of science, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: ‘It’s a cigarette counter that’s used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “It’s really banging now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
With the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can ‘see' the protein HER2, which is often present in all types of cancer, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and bowel cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to tackle cancer cells was already found to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West pulls off pro-Trump tyre and wears a MAGA cap after appearing in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he had hoped
Kanye West was broadcast on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After he had brought his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the lyrics Make America Great Again, he set off a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He’s a racist!’
“If I was worried about racism, I had long since left America,” he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with the alleged assault Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's tirade was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to stab the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had taken backstage under fire for his cap.
“I was backstage.
They said, “Don’t go on the stage with that cap.”
They've tricked me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, ‘Do you want to see how apathetic he looks?’ He said that he would wear her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to be better?
Give me some love."
From the audience, at least twice a beeping call came and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine heard from one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.'
West was too guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU THE MASS TROTSEER.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just herself, and that’s beautiful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports an ideology that harms and explodes my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he is, he says, “the being that is formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name; he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also carried the name Snoop Lion and the late musical Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was shot dead in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast police court on Monday.
The indictment will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington brings out toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor picks up on the stereotype of the macho bully and says that young boys often think when they see such roles on the screen that they need to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt “something went wrong” and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of <0x23>MeToo.
Kit, who is recently married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
“This is a really important question for me personally right now: where did it go wrong with our masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men when they grew up, causing us to face this problem now?”
Kit thinks that television might even be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to its very masculine characters.
He said, “What is born and what is learned?”
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
“There’s clearly something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones if the series ends next summer because he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will be in a revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that way I've kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Compared to the same period last year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of the conservative values of land, according to studies, an estimated 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in the sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and traces them to ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters has filed allegations that one of her staff members has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislature’s Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the accusations are spread by “extreme-right” tweets and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data was posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained information from a Waters employee, the Hill said.
"This unjustified accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly came under criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“You can tell from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He must not become rebellious.
He must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Heavy, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are known,” she said, “and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff members.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - Weak Spying Parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British twist, we now traditionally look for references to Brexit, and that indeed turns out to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a slack spy in the lead, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English.
Is this airy self-satisfying about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with spooky eyes and flexible facial stretches manages to send everything in the hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a common comic character that was conceived for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a shred of that guy who contributed one note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV spots (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain mess behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and ticks the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson may well show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor rather gets weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems to be meant for children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy disastrous pace is less original and focused on me than the unwritten jokes of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all the active secret agents of the United Kingdom known, to the great blackmail of the agent in office, a sadly small role of Kevin Eldon.
That’s the drop that makes the bucket run over from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as politics. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds her of Teresa May, but the script doesn’t offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she must employ a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the English spy lessons remind me of School of Rock.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former sad helper Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, and his wife is the captain of a submarine, a messy and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of clever doll fun: dressed as waitresses, they set a watchful French restaurant on fire, they kick herrie aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English unleash pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the people’s interior.
For the latter, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and uneasy the scene is, she does something reminiscent of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not imagine a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies the party is considering a plan where Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party would consider a radical plan that would allow Brits to work four days a week but get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party would want bosses of companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to make the country’s balance sheet slip in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek has already been approved by the Federation of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not take place from one point to another, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits within the party’s quest to strike the balance in the economy more to the benefit of the workers and also fits within the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
At the moment, however, it is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “A four-day work week is not a political proposition of the party and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour’s conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless drivers” and “profits” at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not get the full value of their share back, as a Labour government could apply “reductions” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which will give 10 percent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast Sunday at 60 Minutes, Correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this happened, after the indictment came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be wall-mounted.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the charge should contain dynamite," he said.
“As for Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who was named by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event with a very impressive line-up of stars and an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time ever, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Concertgoers who wanted to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call, or in any other meaningful way.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 more years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a convenient way to convince people to call for action or is this just another form of ‘clickivism’, giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million ‘actions’ of supporters have been registered, which were aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to world leaders taking action and making policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that must change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected through sponsorships.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important statements of intent are those of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and performers from the UK with the goal of ‘helping children realize their full potential’. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help receive malnutrition in the country after they had received Global Citizens from two more than 4.
“With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and global citizens like you, we can take a step back in history from the social injustice that is malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the UK government was asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website of the Global Citizen asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied, “It will be a long and difficult road, where sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for a ‘blockade’ to impede Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington could "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming to market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that capability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that claims to be the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia with Iran’s approach and noted that they do not differ significantly.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a ‘small art’, with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump of Berlin has made Moscow the “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is being sent only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'seriously thinks about' taking part in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she was "seriously considering" taking part in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering taking part in the election.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and that includes a woman in the top position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider making myself elected as president.”
Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said he is "bringing this country in the wrong direction".
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is bringing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this.”
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters feel she should not be elected in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion poll by the Suffolk University's Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favour of her being elected.
The survey showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent ahead of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD from Track Palin during Donald Trump’s election meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he took office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
“By what my own son has to experience, what he is experiencing now that he is back, I understand for other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning,” she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military have given for the homeland."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a Wasilla police spokesman.
Washington, D.C. and 18 States Support Protests Against New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. on Friday filed a statement as “friend-of-the-court” to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who is battling this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people come who apply for asylum in the United States, as countries that are experiencing major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that made it possible for immigrants without documents on the run for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
“Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle,” the statement reads.
Lawyers continue to argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. damages the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and “provide the country with the necessary workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those fleeing their country due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in its June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her short-lived baby in an evacuation center in the desolate city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched in their overnight possessions for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
Several wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had climbed a broken back and shoulder, were stationed outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the possibility of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' With 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid attachment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge that is denied by China.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked, according to U.S. officials cited by Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasingly higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, who support Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “is now doubling the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is using the freedom of expression and a free press, a long- cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the center of Beijing you will find in vain divergent voices and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people have possible on the difficult economic trajectory, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article," as he did not say which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
Now that many important Republicans are scrambling around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will lead to a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this topic have gone up enormously and most Republicans have already made it known that they want to continue voting.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake’s attempt to plead at the last minute for an FBI investigation would be enough to satisfy the bad voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall as Republicans who have been under the control of the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further clarified her accusation of sexual intimidation against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there could be a setback if the Republicans pressed the nomination.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, the former party president of the Republican Party, told NBC News last week.
"It's not just about the vote on the committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes to court, but it's also about the way Republicans handled this and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, the Americans seem to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority opting for the latter.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony for sure or likely, and 35 percent believe Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had certainly or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s lead, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford said last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals during a party in the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the option to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that “world domination” is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
“We have to do this now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store contact lists, activity lists, an agenda, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to have conversations with Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will put all their business models on their heads at once.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission [of Inrupt] is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and carrier of the Victoria Cross from World Cup I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military is honoured in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never aware that he had the highest British military honor in part.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field fire and machine guns".
He later stormed on to the fire line and led the line forward before he ran only to a field shot and switched off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've been waking up all night to watch a staggered Bellator 206 and you won't be able to see the most important moment.
The San Jose sticker ticket listed 13 fights, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
“According to government regulations, no content is allowed to be displayed after 6:00 a.m., which is why we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked to broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," he said.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK also get a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the rematch, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of texts going back and forth and believe me, these weren’t all as friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally already did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘inferior’ because of his sexual orientation
Olympic cleaner Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to continuing education that “not everyone is what I am.”
In an interview with Lauren Laverne at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that parenting had contributed to making him less valuable in winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has been released for a few months due to illness.
Appearing as a shift on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" during his youth than others because it was "socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, “To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was ‘someone’, so that he wouldn’t disappoint people if they eventually found out about his disposition.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, “has completely surprised me.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "whole outlook" had changed.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t get it about my heart to say, you won’t be there to sit in the front row anymore, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had hit him hard on his way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he must regain his shape to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is at stake.
Because he was never even at the peak of his career known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs dazzling balls routinely penalizes.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches, start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say it hard otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on the back, hit his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I didn’t expect him to play only two games.
I expected more, but it's as it is and it's the way we think we had to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 games, lost 20 games and 7 equal games in his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain irresistible impact on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s grasped, he likes to have fun with people and he’s a great guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players liked to keep him going crazy from time to time last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
De Deen made his debut in the match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with as captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest margin possible: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now," Bjorn said, recalled here, after he had seen the 2018 light of Golf win by 5-3 on Friday and 10 for yesterday.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to work hard tomorrow.
Get started and execute the plan in the right way.
It is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s winning this trophy, and we have to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I’m focusing on the 12 players we can have, but we’re also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Glad about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never progress on things in this area.
Tomorrow there is another challenge.
Tomorrow the individual achievements come to the order, and that is a very different discipline again.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it’s okay, but when you’re alone, your abilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That’s the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the ‘Miracle of Medinah’.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the final day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to get started well, as in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve tailored our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we’re going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and employs Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battalion.
“I chose this group in this order because I think we’re so constantly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest German navy frigate should have been in service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships from the Cold War era, but it will take at least another year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rhineland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which a military spokesman quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve as a replacement for the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of air-defense and anti-ship missiles, and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
The ongoing delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The fateful F125 frigate has already caught the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would render the warship useless if it were to be deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship was suffering from a serious overweight, which would reduce performance and limit the Navy’s ability to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, twice the size of ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
This is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming especially important due to recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of Germany’s parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the navy “has a shortage of deployable ships”.
The official said the problem over time as a snowball has grown, because old ships were taken out of business but no replacement ships were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flesh Mosquitoes
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bats, the brown large-eared bats, and the water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NTS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's crests and what kind of thing it does.
Next, a map of the habitat and a report are produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at the NTS, hopes the results show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making meadows and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Flea mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning bolts can also pose a risk, just like flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Flea mosquitoes are not blind.
However, due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly inspect, inspect, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Thrave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much to know about bats and therefore the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before maintenance is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boy, potentially exterminating a full local population.
Flea mosquitoes are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species we simply don’t know yet how their populations are.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo's accusations of assault qualified as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of attacking an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were reported, called the reports "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by naming my name, but that's part of the trade.
I'm a happy man, and by and by good," added the footballer, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called “an inadmissible reporting of privacy allegations,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as read in the indictment filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a “good guy” for “99 percent,” but that he is sometimes left in the “one percent.”
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that it was mutually agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was "afraid of the consequences" and worried about the "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now says she wants to make the arrangement invalid because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and has left for Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' as automakers leave
The United Kingdom will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the minister of economic affairs.
He added it was "serious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stalled,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also voiced their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the event of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
Toyota's production line is based on the "just-in-time" principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be unrest at the borders that the industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be suspended in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was “exactly tailored to avoid those border checks.”
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and who is a representative for the Unite trade union at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein May Be Delayed Again, White House Says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia’s assistants and possible obstruction of the president’s legal process.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and to dismiss the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he “would rather not” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both said.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is not yet a date for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a reluctance of the "attention-raising" TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president does for him,” she said, without providing proof: “We’ve looked at the figures.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that often in recent weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with the president alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made an open-hearted and sometimes bizarre appearance to the gathered reporters.
Health Minister writes letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to EU staff working at the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to continue working at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already stated its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also tightened the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know that these must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and that bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a head injury in the 31-27 losing game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesseean.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
“He came to the sideline and fell into it more or less,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen directly on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a move from Illinois.
He was batted five times on Saturday before he left the field, resulting in a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a home in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new plans from the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in vacancies is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to earn <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and tell this on multi-dealers.
The increase in vacancies is levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, putting the extra income into government efforts to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current voids, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year in this way.
An estimated 13 percent of new construction in London is bought by people who do not live in the UK, which drives prices up and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically ‘spook cities’ due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a reduction in the vacancy to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore Britain’s “household shade.”
Corbyn has announced a series of striking housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to extensions “without negligence.”
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
“Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister to restore the ‘British Dream’, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of ever owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over their heads is already real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says his “ultimate ambition” is to ever become a manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from north-east England, which currently ranks third in League One, at three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and that was the end of the line,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a child, I saw my father and I often play in Hampden Park, and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that opportunity would only come if I were successful in managing a club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, previously he had denied advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently being measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross only spent three years as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching group.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled the moment he took over from Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did the best I could, I deserved pretty well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There are a lot of things you are confronted with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the subject, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m really there, I’m as good in my skin as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heatwave in the summer has raised revenues from British pubs that have struggled to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business advisory agency CGA, which has collected the figures, said: “During the sunshine and the fact that England participated in the World Championships longer than expected, July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs were still enjoying 2.8 percent more turnover with the restaurant.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales performed far better, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people only went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, beverage revenue was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food revenue was 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for turnover in the entertainment market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover of 4.8 percent year-on-year is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused operators and only time will learn if the more moderate temperatures of August can give it the much-needed breath."
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline from the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sectors, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 High School Students Reveals Growth in 'Fake Insta Pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘head account’ that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean ‘head account’ that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to "rape" her.
The study, which was conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are lured to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director at the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her election to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm happy to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help manage the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and now regularly commenting on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He tweeted: “Today, a month ago, I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terribly hard work, but I have now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support!"
Advertisement for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called “the quietest portable breast pump in the world,” Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has released an ironic, music video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to suffocating mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like, 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything about it' and 'In case you didn't notice, these are not onions, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pumping, pumping, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, pumping, milking the ladies'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has directly caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has triggered hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that it rewards the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they should be expected and born to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days of delivery,” the statement said.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked: “This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious."
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who bleed (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then have the feeling of being just 'cow'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who crawl sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly in a feeding bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they’re on charcoal.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between collapsing mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the collapsing and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in a entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has reached the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their own chance of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households must make their fingerprints and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated in a testimony to Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as a sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have a prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We are pursuing these people,” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, which require some of them to appear in court within one month of the start of detention, instead of within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, rather than in person, to plead their application for legal status before an immigration court.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the greater the likelihood of becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or flight attempts, according to shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even now that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-premier, said the foreign troops were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been devastated and driven out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and from a “possible illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for their return and he warned "some Western countries to spread irrational fears" that would leave most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a thing that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the rebels’ last major stronghold, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has deflected a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal has “clear deadlines” and said he hoped the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and clear the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what the conditions are for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many “liberal” viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a siege procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's 'The Rachel Maddow Show' is at the top of the ratings for cable shows with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the person behind the ABC drama ‘Designated Survivor’, a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of Trump experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear'.
I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is in part that he's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the Trump show's rotating role-sharing.
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you’re after.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He could not get off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Committee and the at stake the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember we did all those weird shows, not so long ago, and people said ‘this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money flows from outside in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania sees an influx of money, thanks to a reshuffling of a constituency that requires two sitting MPs to fight for the same seat.
The newly re-divided Pittsburgh district meets Democratic People’s Representative Conor Lamb, who has won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is set to face another sitting MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th district, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymanding') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a crackdown on campaign funding between the financial arm of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a sharp victory in a well-regarded special election for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for its support to China and refrained from doing so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners removed the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials set out a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward migrating to the United States in efforts to advance that.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government’s importance to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned without further ado to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without harsh messages about Washington’s penal measures.
A White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying the History
The next step may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-justice by Trump, for which heavy evidence has now become public.
Mueller is likely also going to focus his investigation on collaborating between Trump and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must hold himself accountable for that institute, just as he prepares to turn to the voters again, and maybe he should take responsibility for a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot of myths, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and the inexorable march of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested that talks with the president be recorded in secret and that he had speculated about the president’s suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will wait a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech jewish who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived it, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika is depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers will visit Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2–2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use those results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good elftal," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but looking at the whole game, an equal game is probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is another great European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points but it is going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the public is behind us, I am sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
“Last year has certainly been hard, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s a feel-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t make your wishes well known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arms: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or investing your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes when the insurance needs to be used.
Get a health care attorney so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do it yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine your elderly father or mother having a medical emergency and on their way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Record these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medications are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes along.”
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, stomach and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a “willing act.”
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been turned off, the official bodies have not yet received information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster took place.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a rainforest that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunami over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Control Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Atjeh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Regency in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, in which more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling in a report of domestic violence and offering resistance during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troops.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged arrests, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody in Mat-Su's house with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure knowing" when asked about this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, meaning he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now for the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have stabbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by a veteran group in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly held on to his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been switched off while the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake took place just outside the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack, in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who came to his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the statement of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, which has been filed in the Southern District.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the loading of 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in connection with a rocket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation" according to the prosecutors and they described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as "cruel, cruel and corrupt".
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Paganucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since a case was filed in the Southern District of New York demanding the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both corrected by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show resentment in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, even the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
“We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Sajpov’s defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to mobilize a "people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said the politicians should feel the "heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed to give him the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told participants at the march in Birmingham that the UK “would have been gone” if Mr. Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the heavily divided parties is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track while it is being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Participants insisted that she will continue and try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wants to throw ‘Checkers in the trash’.
He suggested that Farage should be rubbed off and should be held accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in the service, we would be out of it now," Bone said.
The MP for Wellingborough added here: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the trash bin."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone suggested that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: prime minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let the Chequers fall and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should “feel the heat” if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here together today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you get away with this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: “I want you to set fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we are once again an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this march with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the group was founded over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the House of Commons for Labour, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to 'Go Thinking Well' About Candidacy for President
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “think well about her candidacy for the presidency” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican delegate who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focal point of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A presenter asked her if she would be elected to the presidency.
Warren replied that "it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our faulty government and that includes a woman at the top."
LSU's Wayde Sims Arrested After Shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, a basketball player at LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and is dead from its consequences," Murphy J. Paul, the police commander, told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and is known to have been present at the scene of the crime, possessing a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incident and is being held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowded tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari rider to release space on the inside after a double move in the third bend.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long time leader of the race, because he stayed at his tyre choice and mikted on to a quick finish, so he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually, in the 44th round, he went to the pits, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and he let me by.
The team has done their best for places one and two," Hamilton said.
That was not a good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election rally on Saturday for insisting she was not the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter in which Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president had not spoken directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee, but rather he made it known that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unkind, and inaccurate'."
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful performance that takes place in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and common and unkind and untrue," he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document-- 'oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
- Well, wait even.
We leaked... No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the charges to Kavanaugh's address were mentioned was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to go with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked.”
But the president turned out not to believe her denial, and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power, with all necessary means.
You see the community, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control," the president would have said according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have cleared Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along, before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up for a delay on Friday night to then beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the first break with a lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard brought them back to an equal footing with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match, late in the second period. He secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies as he ensures hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people on board could board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then ready on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands, and told the country’s disaster control agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral service will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and stockpiles.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will encounter.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the present military: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one more man is missing after previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon one male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane was hit by water during the landing at the Chuuke Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot down over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes told him that he and some others managed to get through the water, which came to their aid, to wade to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seafarers working nearby at a yard had also helped rescue operations by taking people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane further sank in the about 30-meter deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that over the past 20 years, 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but that this has nothing to do with Air Niugini.
Analyst specifies the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a witness-expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone number to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she left her life.
Rowlett said he had received location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the witness bench on Saturday and told him he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he told him he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her from his life," Hale said.
The defense begins on Sunday with the lock arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin hearings later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hiphop trio wants to question the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip hop is alienated from the origin of political opinions and the mapping of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make 'conscious hip-hop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York babysitter sues a couple in court over ‘racist’ text
A New York-based babysitter is suing a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after she received an incorrectly sent text in which the mother had complained about 'again such a black man'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the trial "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEE again is black,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the 'uncomfortable' Plasco-Flaxman, Ms Maurice, was released when she realized her blunder, stating that her former babysitter, who was African-American, had done poor work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now, Maurice is challenging the couple in court to get a compensation of $350 a day for the 6 months she was hired to live with the family internally, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to feel like you’re just not doing that,” Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple disapproves of the claim that she is a racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, having insulted her, feared they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
I'm sorry."
Comparing the trial to “persecution,” Plasco said his wife expected a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to pursue someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to captivate the couple on social media, where they are outraged for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared the public wouldn’t have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly discovered letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we know now about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She said that her father, who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "bitterzoet."
About Paddington, who she describes as “a very prominent member of the family,” she told The Associated Press that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
“But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost seemed like a child’s performance; you’re proud of it while you’ve done nothing for it.
I think he was about to experience Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he chose the bear for success.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
“Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that they expected her not to get it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad's phone came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love your treasure so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly worked out and left her body.
She had been dead for some time before, and this process turned everything off further.
I could only sit there, knowing what was going on.
I could not mourn, cry or cry, for I was in the midst of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to be big.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to go through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women of color post messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide make strong efforts to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit up every room.
Still, he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had robbed himself of his life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t keep quiet, talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt gloomy or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely on the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids unpacked their presents, he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to deal with it: “It will tear the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we can really get together what he is asking for; an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create some more unity again," Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was going to 'disagree' against me.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to set up an investigation?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans do the wrong thing, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and so got to know his wife Ashley, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Vice President Mike Pence the opportunity to cast the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of overrunners 'decreased' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean overrunners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang did not respond in public.
The vast majority of North Korean survivors will eventually be offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can easily cross the border than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often extorts them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, where the main focus was on the stable negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they largely agreed to work on the Korean peninsula’s nuclear disarmament.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without belief in the actions of the United States, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no first step in unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him “large and coordinated character murder,” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to set up an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say that; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or the FBI, then he's not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he currently serves," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would go on to speak out against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, after all, Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh bypassed questions about the review of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to stand cheering when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just tirade of months and years of arousing anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry if we get angry,” Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "I've been tremendously helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who told me that she was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, where she was always going to cry when she got angry. She said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because,
I'm angry.'
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partially allowed as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best kept memories from a previous job, in a male-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was so angry. An older woman, a guy business manager everyone was a little scared of, grabbed me in my ankle and dragged me into a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an outspoken affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat' or 'apen') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not stand up.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fundraising, and so she solemnly promised not to participate if she could not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
“Maybe they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she wouldn’t start a formal campaign anyway, she became so overwhelmed by feelings — of gratitude to the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of having sex in it — delegated it, and delegated it.
"They will have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
"They will have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She was crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could be beneficial for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the U.S. and China were overwhelming, and while the fight has not yet been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to long-term experts, befitting Beijing.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated every time in nature, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is likely not going to blink quickly.
To allow Washington to bend, requests must be accepted, but to bend publicly for the U.S. is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays it smart, China could positively support the trade war with the U.S. in the longer term, by decreasing mutual dependence on the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead to an economic free fall in either country is actually far more dangerous than spectators have acknowledged before,” said Abigail Grace, a senior researcher at the American Security.
Syria 'ready' to allow refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the conditions in his country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
There are an estimated six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had subsidized the insurgency.
Europe wins 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn scored the necessary number of 14.5 points to beat the US.
American team star Phil Mickelson, who was battling almost the entire tournament, made his long shot from the tee to the water at par 3, hole 16, admitting his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the European team's lowest scorer, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-ranked player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
“I’m not crying so fast, but today I can’t do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods, I followed that guy all the time when I was growing up," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American leader, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
Shortly this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We were opposed.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
