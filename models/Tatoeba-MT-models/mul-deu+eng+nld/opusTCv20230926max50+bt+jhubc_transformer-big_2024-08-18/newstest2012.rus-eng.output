Parliament does not support the amendment that gives freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine in the course of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code rejected the attempt to repeal the article, according to which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was condemned.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on mitigation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was deemed unfavorable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the verdict is the political site of the regime; in the West, the process has also been suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and without him the war is over.
It’s time to determine the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the usual Sharia law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a country without crime, since the punishment for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and which we are unlikely to wish for.
Either way, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind, nor the best, and probably would not have suited, for example, the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic militants received help from the non-believers.
Their only excuse is that, in their opinion, NATO was not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each blow.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, we served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "crusaders".
Although without occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold almost invaluable?
They probably won't get it, and then the West will finally be able to defend civil rights without any interest.
Unless Sharia followers put an end to this.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are at the centre of the attention of investors.
A statistical storm struck over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have released data on GDP in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a stagnant state, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; now they have focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Eurozone Statistical Offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the initial 0.1%). France reported a slight decline, by 0.1% (the initial information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation. According to the Czech Statistical Bureau, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
The key events are:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a stagnant state compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany’s economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth compared to the previous quarter by 0.2%, which coincides with analysts’ forecasts.
Greece’s economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Profitability of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching the critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the yield of Czech one-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech team has been selected for the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won with an account of 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and beautiful goal Peter Yira<0xC4><0x8D>ek they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky enough to retain a significant advantage after the home match, and she will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the progress of the match and prepared a detailed report.
Hardly anything remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and heroic Iira<0xC4><0x8D>ek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the exit to the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovych and Vucinych became the most unsuccessful pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Peter Czech - one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
The game was very tense from the first minute.
Both teams had difficulty in making combinations; the game spent most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the part of the team of hosts in the first half. Long-range strikes over the line of defense were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a live shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
Thus, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, the prayers of students before entering the building followed a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a live shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In this way, they demonstrated their willingness to protect their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that it was all evidence that Iran had not abandoned an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, prayers of students before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant followed a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, the installation in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Diet of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who lead an unhealthy lifestyle.
We see once again the importance of the environment and patterns of behavior associated with a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is no coincidence.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports. This, however, concerns most of the families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of the children said that their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last academic year; it was attended by almost 900 elementary students throughout Bohemia.
The Obesity event was held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company V<0xC5><0xA1>eobecn<0xC3><0xA1> zvetotn<0xC3><0xAD> poji<0xC5><0xA1>tovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate athletic load are the main determining factors that cause a rapidly growing number of children who are suffering from either overweight or obese.
“For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five times a day, on a breakfast-percus-lunch-percus-dinner scheme, which is one of the indispensable conditions for proper nutrition,” said one of the study’s findings.
No lunches and sausages in the evening
Experts warn that even relative details such as the constant time of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has their own breakfast.
The worst discovery was that in every 10 families, people don’t have breakfast at all.
And yet, breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study found that fried foods are more often used in families with children who are obese.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet refreshments every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly engage in sports, this figure drops more than twice - to 15% - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to create their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
“The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of bitter, meaty and sweet dishes.
“Special anxiety is caused by the great popularity of sweetened soft drinks,” the study concludes.
As the main meal, the pasta defeated the bird with a small excess.
However, the children showed virtually no interest in bean, fish and vegetable dishes.
Aspiration for a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits, provided they are provided with the appropriate information.
"Many participants in the study's control group demonstrated a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out a questionnaire after the lecture Obesity is not an accident," the project said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet soft drinks - more children began to prefer them simply water.
In addition, as the main dish, the children more often noted the bird and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and baking.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on training for stylists, I sat down on the amount of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; tips on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all this works in real life.
Next - more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Elena, the director, (there is not a single man on the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short neck, another male figure without proper shapes, another one weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add missing volumes.
We were given tips on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, the possessors of more lush breasts and thighs and a narrow waist, and at the same time not to dress them too dauntingly.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and thighs is so large that you can not pick a skirt or pants, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will obviously not regret the funds invested, as perfectly sitting clothes are invaluable.
In a skirt sewn to order, you will feel much better than in the one that constantly goes out, rolled up, nude the waist, etc.
The holders of boys' figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with grooves, appliqué, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have an entire week to realize it all.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we've been given.
Each participant of the course had to come up with two outfits for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing and the type of figure.
I have to dress up Miranda Kerr, which you may know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I’m happy about myself because it’s so much easier to wear it than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently made a ton (please keep in mind that I’m exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print and process them using graphical programs.
Mudboard - so-called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphical component of the style.
A stylist not only dresses real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what the designer and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only on Sunday.
A stylist needs common knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in the field.
Stylist, Honza Suborny; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist knows how to use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, over jeans and shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without fastenings like a dress.
Another option is to roll the sleeves or raise the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
“Play with him,” he said.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice the most: "For your work you need to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start violating them,” Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we blur all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see completely different.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
From Ben, a photographer, I learned that a stylist should have more options for outfits than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a ten-page fashion review (equivalent to ten outfits) I must be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the object of clothing often looks and works in combination with others quite unlike in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when creating an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often the image and style is half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have a striking vocals, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and the way they look - secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us another (less) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity fattening/weighting, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for the stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick out the outfit.
Our job is mainly to communicate with the people we dress up with; so it’s important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to serve them and hold on to their opinions.
“If a manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can’t throw away all of her wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are horrible.”
“Find at least a few things that you can praise and advise what you can carry with you,” Mario says.
He also showed us that specifically a work bag should be accommodated.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things such as scissors, sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting certain items, such as handbags or hats for handkerchiefs), special clips for fastening the fabric on the back, in case of
In order to distract ourselves from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we have learned how to make the pads on the soles of the shoes correctly.
Even during filming in the studio, where the floor is smooth, soles can get damaged - not to mention filming on the street.
And here we go with the glue.
You should not touch shoes with scissors so as not to spoil them.
This requires a real mastery.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
Those skills didn’t come to my mind.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t as easy as you say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Review
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and negligent mistakes.
Ambitions have been met to some extent, but that doesn’t matter, as no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subheading "Pobeg", there was great hope.
It was expected to shift the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; the demo versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs away.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, a lot is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression spoils a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
In fact, this is not a mistake, but an inexplicable deception of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of the story, the main character of which, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has a few interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place along its own route, and individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
It doesn’t feel like the same thing is happening in the game all the time.
Despite the fact that the graphics are on the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is nice to look at some of the tracks.
However, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you get into a sandstorm, significantly reducing visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The individual races are quite well-ordered.
There are only a few varieties, but that’s enough.
For some time you are trying to outrun several opponents (essentially a normal race); then you are trying to improve time (a standard race with a second timer); or you are competing with one opponent.
Among other things, from time to time you run into a police force that makes your task even more complicated.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you should help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you would expect (just three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it’s good for the game because this property doesn’t get bored; considering all of the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more enjoyable.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you’re looking for a real-life imitation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although in the market you can find better options.
So far it's very good.
However, after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
From such a game you do not expect complex transformations and collisions, but if you have no idea before the collision with the object, how will your car behave, something is wrong.
Usually, when overtaking or passing the machine in a dense flow, you sometimes slightly touch another machine. And yet sometimes in a virtually similar situation your machine starts to roll madly.
Or it's broken in the air.
It’s not so important thanks to the restart system, but it’s enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you break or walk away from the track, the game takes you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five reboots are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the very beginning.
This is useful in case something doesn’t work, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes reboots are not enough, and you have to learn a separate section of the race.
An important drawback of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to go through in a certain way, otherwise you just won’t sign up.
In other cases, you encounter civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily drifting between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you are there, the cars are already positioned in such a way that you need to either circumvent them or slow down the speed.
It doesn’t matter when you’re next to them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Rivals also have other advantages.
During the game you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent beats you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand in front of you in spite of anything.
The fact is that when it goes in front of you, it worsens your review, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
Too bad, because despite the simple driving model, the game is fun and sometimes so saturated with events that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on around you.
It doesn’t matter what you don’t miss – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to track the refueling along the way, as it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars – for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain tracks.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; these are races on individual stages that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points common to the challenges and story modes.
There are many options available to get a higher level of driving: from machines to profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online feature Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here’s another drawback that’s hard to understand; it’s an example from the last race in a row.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (let’s assume that’s the case) where you’re racing on the rails in the dark (let’s assume that’s the case).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let’s assume that this is the case) when suddenly a subway train hits you in the back, turning your car into a punched chest.
For a few days, our editorial staff was discussing whether no one really thought for a second at the time of creating the game, or whether its creators really thought we were such fools.
The technical constituent of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from a videographer is mostly pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is unfortunate that at some critical moments, the quality of the recording, sometimes quite significantly, decreases.
This is especially true of events with a large number of participants, where a good record wouldn’t help you much either.
Sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
In order to please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack has ‘compositions from different styles’; but it’s unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is rather messy.
If the game had avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS over the past few years.
Either way, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it’s good fun, but be prepared for the fact that the shortcomings will blind you like the headlights of the airport.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenza:
The Czechs have a reputation of disgruntled and sceptical about the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon has caused significant discrepancies between individual organisations.”
“I didn’t expect such a brutal war.”
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players will get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vicenov began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adhered to her motto “Clear and Open about Europe” in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simply and understandably that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the CU would be jealous.
In addition, Vitsenov praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse that couldn’t perform any role; I must say everyone was amazed at how well he did his role.”
“He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven countries at the same time, communicate with them perfectly and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU needs to develop.”
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security issues in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?"; that is, as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or China.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vitsenova continued to focus on the programme, which is key for the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She named the Czech Presidency a successful one last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon, inflicting considerable damage on the Czech Republic.
Currently, the Czech Republic’s representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will receive less; all of these issues are in the forthcoming programme.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: “About Europe, in a comprehensible language.”
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How citizens can understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses.”
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organisations.
A fast-paced Europe is our future
The ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered Euro-sceptics; as well as people who point out the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
It wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organisations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what about the assembly, again the Visegrad group?' and he's not happy about it.'
In the future, the Union of Vicenza expects mainly new strict rules for the fiscal policy of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, she considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
“We have a Schengen area and we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that countries that want to unite, while those that don’t, can stay on the sidelines.”
“The number of such institutions will grow; it will truly be a two-speed Europe,” Vicenza said.
In this regard, she underlined the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all issues relating to the whole of the EU should be discussed by all the participating countries, not just those in the Eurozone.
History of the brand:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses IMB’s strategy, the closest one is likely to be “long-lasting.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company’s longevity was laid down by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson the Elder.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people want to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
What’s more, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, it has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years we hope to achieve even more,” said Samuel J. Palmizano, the current head of the company, on the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s Watson approached the issue of caring for employees as well as Batya in the Czech Republic – IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniform and a complex system of bonuses for.
The same is true of IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found a brilliant application for talented people. It was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it an excellent choice.
Agree with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
In the last few years, IBM has organized online brainstorming meetings, during which many future innovations emerge.
Not surprisingly, there are a lot of ideas – about half a million people work in the company.
An Organization with a Good Reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
“From the very beginning, from the point of view of the concept, IBM was an organization rather than a technology company,” Professor of Business at Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM, Rosabet Moss Canter, told the Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Joe Colony of Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going into the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company – developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services – from servers to nanotechnologies.
It owns the largest number of patents among all U.S. technology companies, and its five employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (first place - at Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward.
Not all of its products came to the taste of buyers and fit in the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays the foundation on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it’s giving up on them.
This makes it different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s core revenue comes from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with a capital of twice as little, it was the strongest company-manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion. At the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
So far, IBM does not seem to have caused any harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s share price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company’s net earnings have steadily increased.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM's History: From Cheese Knife to Space Flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computing, Tabulation, Recording Corporation" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally it was called the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the legendary "table clock", i.e. clocks that record the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the board of trustees of the company.
Flint hired a rival company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The CEO then put the founder of IBM in the shadows – Watson’s ideas remain the foundation of an inviolable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started producing and selling various business equipment – from cheese knives and butchers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and a large-scale expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the chair of the director was taken by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control space flights — to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 — human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers – the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time buying the consulting division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and services with high value added.
In the last three years, IBM has achieved great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make reasonable use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned, and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the field of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Headquarters in Central and Eastern Europe are located in Prague, where a world-class research group on speech recognition is also working.
Retirement of your Infidel Husband:
Iveta, leave the fool alone, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richter (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has set clear rules for her future life.
“Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore,” Rihtarzhova explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova donated Bartoshova’s blood to her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Iveta to leave Rjican after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He has publicly admitted that he loves her.
After a while Darina gave up, pretending to have reconciled with her husband’s novel; and now she has finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richard and Bartoshov ever parted ways, his wife would not accept him with extended arms.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out.”
"However, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom something connects me," Richtarzhova said, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual occasions.
So far, Joseph has nothing against the fact that his wife rejected him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our alliance is still functioning; I am responsible for repairing, gardening, home and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly well, but we don’t share the bed anymore,” the director told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rihtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes or who she has a friend with.
“I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I bear full responsibility,” Joseph said.
Worst Women’s Habits: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men to name some of the typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you recognize yourself in the following lines describing several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Is your second half complaining that you’re constantly shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one item every week?
Do you like to shop at large sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who among you will refuse to walk through the clothing stores in search of the ideally sitting clothes and modeling it (preferably in different color variants) in the exemplary ones?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside for you...
Perpetual Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah? Yeah.
Then you belong to a group of women who are impaired in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop monitoring yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of partners about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaning, floor washing, dust sweeping, bath cleaning - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for coming up on a clean tile in dirty shoes; children for the dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in the living room that was so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this “deviation,” try to realize that falling into the extreme is not good; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not come first.
An innocuous desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as the whole family.
Aspiration to Command
"Throw your underwear into the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find it very tedious.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps, if men understood this, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Spletni
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, and why.
From time to time, each of us may break up a quarrel.
Let’s be honest, that’s the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women’s workforce, pose a greater danger to their environment.
Resultant transfers of Jagra and Vorachek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey striker Yaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Carolina's ice. He again became the most effective Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Girou used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best player of the match.
Two successful transfers of the match also belonged to the same team playing with Jagro Yakubu Vorachek.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Zira.
"I told him before the game that he was going to hit the hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," Jagr explained, after whose actions Jiru scored the goal at the first opportunity that the Flyers gave.
A little later the second goal of the team also had a "Czech footprint".
The closing Harrickeins Vorachek captured the shawbaby and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the rounds.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a number of advantages, but at the start of the second half the Flyers led again.
Especially Zhiru.
After Jagra's successful delivery, he scored a third goal; his stroke was subsequently converted into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said, praising his centre-back.
“I never thought I would play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career.
“That makes me happy.”
“I want to support him.”
“All these years in the NHL my teammates tried to help me, and now it’s my turn,” added Jagr.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Rut and Dwyer's penalty, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the shovel, I accelerated, and Reid moved to the far end."
"I was aiming at him and I'm glad it worked," Voracek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal Czech team Yaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to injury to the upper body.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadians lost their two-point lead and lost 2–3 after a penalty series.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanets was unable to score during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was saddened by a large number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with only five defenders.
“The situation is bad.”
“We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“However, we can’t do anything about it, we just have to accept it,” said Jacques Martin.
“Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn’t resist.”
“We needed to simplify the game, move the washer out of our zone.”
“What was our weak side,” added defender P.K. Subban.
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onjaj Pavelets helped Winnipeg beat Tampa Bay 5:2.
Jets goals, which interrupted a five-match series of defeats, were hit by five different players.
The dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourism agencies were able to operate in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies at the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists went on holiday to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter was required from that country; otherwise individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to either stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A currency permit was required for travel to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain cash (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit remains to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus undergone a real revolution.
While until 1989 vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we are no longer aware of, is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia at the moment, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries of Western Europe was abolished. This led to a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not be satisfied with the trips to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring your own food (canned food, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech krona. After decades, our tourists can finally freely buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines. Compared to the past, airfares have now become incredibly cheap thanks to the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed countries of the world, except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. High demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been taking Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will go to twelve exotic destinations.
At present, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, which symbolizes our post-revolution development, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the requirement to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Our country has thus forever joined the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than CZK 15,000 per person during their vacation abroad, including their destination expenses.
The general assembly must elect the president, the threat of the duck returns
For about five months, Czech football had no president. There is a risk that the successor of Ivan Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held in Nimburk in the city of Nimburk.
There is still no consensus as to what election rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Ind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paclik want to lead Czech football.
Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek left his post in June. Leaving, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, the Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek era once again plunged football into a split between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
It became clear on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly came quickly to the National House in Prague, Smihov, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general meeting - only legal representatives or officials who had been empowered.
This point has since been partially resolved thanks to the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which a representation based on the powers conferred is not possible.
Controversy over the election rules, however, continues.
The Executive Board was also not very helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
The views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is this: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the pat?
"The dispute is whether to follow the established standards or find another model," says one of the vice presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who has received much support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is claimed that Moravia agrees on a compromise - to consider the winner of the election of the candidate with the most out of the total number of votes in both houses.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the overall percentage ratio, the winner must win at least two thirds of the vote.
"Nevertheless, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two chambers", Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to existing norms.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paclik agrees with his opinion, although according to estimates of the election rules determined by the charter, Pelt is more fit than other candidates.
“I would like the elections to be as constitutional as possible.”
“I want to avoid all sorts of representational stupidity, as at the previous general meeting,” says owner Victoria Plzen, who is for the first time a candidate; and in his remarks he mainly contradicted Pelte.
Pelta is optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburg; he also hopes that in the future the candidates will cooperate constructively.
“All the emotional fermentation will calm down after today’s expected departure of the national team in the European Championship.”
"Football will once again be on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonets. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management, both at professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I'm hoping for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
“It’s not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to intentionally adapt the rules.”
“This could lead to another collapse of the General Assembly.”
"I hope that common sense will win," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be delivered, among others, by the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction. They sought an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of the transfer.
After all, the ministerial meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like the opposing parties as part of the country’s strongest sports association to come to an agreement.
There are many things on the map: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclick enters the presidential struggle because he doesn’t see a suitable candidate
If before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of football players Plze<0xC5><0x88> Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paclik would have seen a strong candidate who would have met all his demands to the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have even claimed a high position.
“If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself.”
"But such a man has not yet been found," Patslik <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
The motive of Paclick to enter the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Indrzhih Reichl is to try to prevent Pelte, the supposed favorite of the elections, from entering the administration of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that in the event of a victory, he will remain president until 2013, when another general meeting is planned.
In the future he would like this post to be occupied by an experienced top manager, not too much related to football life.
“I’ve talked to a lot of people that I could have thought of.”
“It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don’t even want to have a relationship with Czech football.
“I would like to change that view,” he said.
Currently, the main discrepancy between Pazlik and Pelta is related to the latter’s relationship with Roman Berber, president of the regional football association in Plzen. Berber is a man of contradictory reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist.
Pazlik, therefore, considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and the football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football," Paclick said.
He points to the fact that several years ago the name of Pelta was recorded while listening to the phones during the corruption investigation; Pelta managed to escape the sentence.
“I don’t know what prestige Peltty’s victory would bring to football.”
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," Pazlik said. He now does not mention his previous statement that he "will sell the club Plzen if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclick wins on Thursday, he could imagine collaborating with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclick supported in front of the September general assembly, which ended the fiasco.
“He [Pelta] would be the first to whom I would address.”
'He's very capable.'
“I can introduce him to the team.”
"But he can't run the association."
“I also don’t shy away from what I don’t understand,” said Pazlik, who drew a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of the Judicial Brigade led by Ludek Matsela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims he's risking running the association.
He draws on his experience of managing private companies; since last summer he has managed the Plzen team, which with his help celebrated his first league triumph in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its changes for the better.”
“To limit the influence of some groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals council, which leads to disgusting situations,” Pazlik said. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krezhetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money for sport from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key points that the new president must address.”
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with the Plzen club to be a burden, although he claims that the president of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, while Reichl is associated with the Prague Dukla.
“This is not the ideal option.”
"And yet I don't see any point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares of the Plzen club to someone else, as I'm going to be back there in six months," Paclick said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will allow to avoid Elected Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for new rules of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R in order to avoid disputes about the rules of the election in the future.
Until the negotiations in Nimburg on Thursday, the official of Yablonets remains optimistic and believes that attention from the election fight will significantly distract today’s expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelt promised that if he wins, he will focus on both the representation and the receipt of funds.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time now for someone to head the association,” says the man, mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association’s executive committee.
This gives him reason to assume that he’s experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by euphoria, which reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the June general meeting."
“If different modes of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
He referred to the rewrite of the key document of the civil association as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I am going to take personal responsibility if this attempt turns out to be unsuccessful."
“It’s a fundamental issue without which we can’t exist,” says Pelta.
In addition, he says he is not trying to stand out against the background of rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his cooperation with Indrezhe Reichl, whom he appreciates for his legal education; he is fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclick, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and has achieved some success."
“However, his attacks were rude, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign.”
"Even so, some of them are now doubting his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the statements he made in September.
He considers his main weapon of knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent the whole of football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian cases or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Immediately after that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee a sufficient amount of money for the whole of football,” the forty-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of head of football would not lead to the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual employees." It was his message to the insurance company, where the prolonged period of inter-government causes obvious nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that on Thursday delegates will come to Nimburg not in vain.
“If the only controversial question is how to hold the election in the third round, we can deal with it.”
“Football needs the trust it can get only by finally choosing its leader,” says Pelta, who two days before the key day of his career remains an optimist.
Reichl promises that under his leadership the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will begin to work actively
If the current vice president of the Czech Football Association becomes president at the meeting on Thursday, many people in the Association will be dissatisfied, according to reports.
Reichl promises that if he is chosen, the time of hard work will come.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to raise more money in football; and to continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gashek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national team, professional football and youth football events," he said.
"I don't want to say that I will do everything myself," Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to allocate the powers on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
“I’m carefully allocating the tasks so that in each of these segments football takes great steps forward.”
“It’s probably not going to be liked by many people because it’s going to mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement presumably made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it makes sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Nevertheless, many people have told me that I should not give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust that I can't give up," he said.
What’s more, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hashek.
“A lot of work has been done over those two years, and I don’t want to overwrite it all.”
“Processes have been started that can bring results in a few years, and I don’t want anyone else to stop them,” he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Ga<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something Mirek Pelt is unlikely to be competent in.”
“He’s surrounded by people who would play football so that it’s only available to the elect.”
“I can be blamed for a lot, but certainly not for subjectivity.”
“I’m trying to be objective.”
"I want to make football accessible to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
“While many people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue the fight in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While Plzen manager Tomash Paclick has entered the presidential struggle, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"Nevertheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," said Reichl, speaking of the Laws of the Laws of the Laws of the Laws of the Laws of the Laws of the Laws.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta has been “out of the process of returning credit to Czech football,” he considers another rival, Paclick, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he did a great job at Pilsen this year.”
“If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit," Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travellers can try out the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn’t do during her research trips for the past year and a half: without her swimsuit.
Laying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubs, waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored pools in the Art Nouveau style.
She was in a hurry to add every liked pool to her notebook – with important details about the building’s construction and history.
The architectural historian Meder has examined more than 200 swimming pools - and has now collected impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden (The Joys of Bathing), which included everything from public pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in Black and Leicester.
Her "travel to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" has led her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited baths in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, says Meder, but in the water it’s different.
The only drawback is that swimmers should settle for the blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the seductive smell of pine forests or listen to the joyous chirking of birds in the park.
“I once wondered why swimming pools should always be so horrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture.
Splashing in the pool and exquisite oils in the sauna - a healing factor in the baths is so significant, because, in the opinion of Meder, all the feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have a surface of water."
“The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building.”
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and tramplings.
The 190-page illustrated edition of The Joy of Bathing contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oasis – and makes you want to jump into the water.
Watercollector Meder discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in the karst cave (the cave bath in Myshkolts-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water, in a building built in the form of a bottle of silhouettes (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdö in Yasberene), as well as a bottle of silhouettes (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdö in Jasbergene).
From many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a breathtaking view. You can see the whole of Zurich from the swimming pool on the roof or look at the snow-covered Arlberg from the open swimming pool in St. Anton. And in the pair there is
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld. The aquatic council in Actal looks like a UFO, just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open sinks rises from it, which seem quite small against the background of the Ethal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The pool collector, Meder, did not meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray. The name baths of Arpada in Bekeshchab smell so much of oil that you may find it difficult to believe that you are in a health source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the filament, which sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a healing experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, at one point was disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Luga<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she found that the territory was sealed.
The baths, designed by the architect Dushan Yurkovic in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked at the visible types of windows of a red-white-yellow Art Nouveau-style building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald – the Thermal Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The swimming pools have already gone through three stages of construction. You will discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements of the post-construction period in 1844, but also the Mauritanian hall in the style of Alhambra, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder – and not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement - so masterfully combining such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Diving in a thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary activity.
Speculation of Agricultural Products (Agricultural Products)
The Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural commodities.
Christian Thieves
Will the Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural commodities?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann gave the task force a task to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The Executive Director is planning to make changes in January.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis from the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that wagering on global commodity exchanges raises prices — and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The campaign of defenders of consumer interests is directed directly against the head of Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are trading as well.
Initially, bets on goods were designed as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have given up the rules of supply and demand – and benefit at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism. He promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "is worth risking the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
The trade in goods may be reduced or stopped altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode was delighted with the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "Bets on rising food prices are a striking example of how thoughtless banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the main lobbyist of the bank, Ackermann has a certain obligation, according to Bode.
“Douche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s about the hungry people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank.”
Akkermann’s quick response is surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not be transferred to the Supervisory Board as planned.
The abolition of the disputed speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also practically does not have to worry about expenses - with the consequences will have to deal with his successor.
One in two people would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people participated.
No more than eleven per cent believe that investments that place a bet on the price of food are acceptable to the Deutsche Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade. According to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits, which ultimately lead to speculative goods.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Vinsovsky
An architectural history with ups and downs and a happy ending. The Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was deserted and abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, bold that expressed faith in technical progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its lightweight evaporative steel and glass construction.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, it became famous all over the world in 1973 for its legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister – the cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna’s South Station, converted and opened as a Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 – and is often referred to as the “House of the 20th Century” for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls on which works of art could be hung, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until the modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition is getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has restored the pavilion, which has been called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is the Belvedere Museum department, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in every sense a joyous event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arko, a graduate of the Faculty of History of Arts with a brilliant career as a figure-maker in youth, who worked at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Contemporary in Salzburg.
The new museum was to house a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict control & a limited budget
Krishanitz was at that time the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession by Joseph Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna, and the pavilion was for him an "exclusively important place" where he attended the "nearly any" exhibitions.
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and converted.
The problems that arose during the last restructuring were much more serious. The building was a "energy absorber", says Krishanitz.
Window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, fiberglass reinforced safe glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safe glass.
The steel transmissions of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, the lit light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building, but still the elegant Pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The movie theater is the same as it was before.
All this under strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum management,” says Krishanitz, pointing to uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remained flexible and lightweight, despite the limitations, problems and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough - a typical story "drop in the city".
Such an architecture is “always not in its place” and nevertheless wants to “stimulate real awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, because when planning the city unexpected luck happened. The completely reconstructed "quarter of the main station" with offices and residential real estate is growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may take place. The house of the 21st century can be complemented by the second building of the Chrysanthemum - the collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Temporary Exhibition Hall of Berlin and, reportedly, is negotiating with the city on its location.
Deutsche Bahn plans multi-million-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan of Deutsche Bahn, the Bild newspaper reports that by 2015, investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned.
Investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of self-employed and engaged employees involved in cleaning snow from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clean the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned about the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at a time of deterioration of the weather conditions.
Many of the new regional trains of the year were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays with the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axles of the ICE trains much more often over the years after one of the ICE trains broke the axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank to pay many millions of pounds of fine in the United States
New troubles followed the unrest around Josef Ackermann, the CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank threatens a fine in the United States of many millions of pounds sterling.
Like Deutsche Bank, there were few problems in the homeland, the past of the industrial giant in the United States has now pushed it. Deutsche Bank with headquarters in Frankfurt will pay 145 million bucks per socre of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million worth of time to calm the disputes that arose after the bank collapsed.
The problem has arisen around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA), a regulator of the financial market, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The cost of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
"We are pleased that we have resolved this problem without bringing the parties to court," said a representative of the Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not acknowledge its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the operative response of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that are poured out from billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are backed by internal loans.
This resolved the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble burst in the real estate market in the United States in 2007.
The U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life on the brink of a financial crisis in September 2008.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still battling the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
Behind the biggest wave of claims is the Federal Agency for the Financing of Housing Construction (FHFA).
It accuses 18 of the largest international banks of having acquired $200 billion in collateral agreements from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Deutsche Bank is also facing a threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements totaling $14.2 billion, concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the Frankfurt-based bank to take responsibility for “significant losses” but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and reported its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett Invests $10 Billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth a total of more than ten billion dollars.
To date, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his view on investments in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment was regarded as a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now been awarded the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with US business channel CNBC Buffett said that since March, he has acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, which managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a considerable amount of time, IBM has focused on such high-yield IT services as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which has now been more than 100 years, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
To date, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He said he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in mechanical engineering.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old bought a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the world’s most expensive companies on the basis of clever investments.
However, his way of life remained modest.
It has become a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible money-making instinct earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
IBM’s stock price rose by one percent before markets opened after Buffett’s investment announcement.
The “Blue Giant,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the world’s most expensive high-tech companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The Inevitable Danger
After the discovery of the “Cells in Zwickau” the Turkish media began to doubt the power of law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of a “blood ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have become a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany this news has brought to life long-forgotten fears. There have been no such right-wing attacks on Turks since the fires in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
“The revival of the bloody ideology?” was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret intelligence officer, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be involved in a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly, recalling victims of racial hatred with a silent picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians, the Turkish municipality of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour agreement.
The cooperation between the two countries has been presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The lighting in some Turkish media was like a bluff. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss the occasion to conduct this parallel.
"Starts to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He notes that people were killed, who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raids were strongly criticized in German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities hadn’t thought about monitoring suspects in right-wing extremist circles before.
Some authors have come up with a rather sharp rhetoric: "If they continue to act just as rudely, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves armed."
“This will be the best self-defense.”
“The peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network will be opened and on the legality of the punishment,” Selen writes.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
The photograph of the burnt ruins in Zolingen was deeply captured in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans – that mistrust and indifference can spill into real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past.
The Turkish press in that period mainly condemned the failures of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kol refused to visit the survivors in Meln.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the Zolingen fires, but his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany.
It is as if he determined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media once again showed how deepened since then the distrust of many German Turks in the current German state.
He has clearly shown what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Most of Europe’s leading risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been constantly fighting one or the other crisis ever since.
Now the German must get him back on track.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he'd get that role.
In July, after his effective resignation from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he will begin work on a no less effective post – Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was clearly enthusiastic, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its re-acquired strength and made several friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
UBS has been able to change for the better.
“I look forward to the opportunity to work with Kaspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel.”
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take up his post?
Weber is due to consult the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will hold the post of chairman of the council already in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that he had long deserved the title of “largest banking scandal in Europe.”
UBS, on the one hand, is very big – until recently it managed the world’s largest assets – and on the other hand, it hasn’t come out of scandals for years.
It seems that a proud Swiss bank won’t save anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a good reputation.
The bank combined the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time clever asset manager with ambitious goals and aspirations to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed $1.6 billion, thus managing more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
and as an investment bank entered the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, who has long taught at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Banking, explains: “I have always given my students UBS as a sample of a good bank.”
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, executive director Peter Wuffley – who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker – unexpectedly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank’s investment unit tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write down billions.
Believe it or not, but UBS has announced a 13 billion Swiss franc capital increase to counter the crisis.
The bank has indeed managed to find investors – but investors, many of whom would have politely refused services until recently – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that even its name has not been disclosed.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospell - the second-level salary chairman of the board of directors in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.
A disaster occurred in October 2008. Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS faced a threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become the bank’s co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the establishment of huge banks in a small country.
After all, UBS’s final balance sheet in 2007 was five times more than the entire Swiss production (see chart).
“We won’t be able to save UBS a second time,” said bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was willing to hand over data to wealthy customers who may have been tax-free with the help of the bank.
UBS has also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS, therefore, more or less acknowledged that it was a tool of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for rich customers – the veil of secrecy.
Since then, the Swiss banking secrecy has not been the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer’s money has started.
Over the past few months, the bank has lost confidence in both main areas of its activity – in investment due to unsuccessful speculation and in asset management as a result of helping and encouraging tax evasion.
And everything calmed down and it began to seem that UBS managed to break the situation as this disaster happened with an affaire-trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear - the risk management in the investment department is not yet working.
“The incident with Aboboli has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk control tool.”
For a long time, caution has made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside of the Alpine Republic or not yet.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a refined taste in chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, - only a little more.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The bank’s head office is located in Zurich on the Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find jewelry companies like Tiffany's here.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years – from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Barre.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas. Next to the emblem of the bank there is a large indicator "Safe".
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss notion of banking – or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn’t want to see his name in the newspaper – like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big, particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
In my opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, then they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungles of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” Lucas Hessig wrote in his book Crack UBS.
Politicians have approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly in the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which at the time of the merger was too big for a small Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but graduated bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the omnipotent wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffly, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospell, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wolffly and Ospell were the dream team,” said bank analyst Hans Geiger.
“Wolfly, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Ospell with his inner instinct, who has gone all the way up from an intern to a bank.”
But Ospell eventually settled on Wolffly.
And Wolffly could have made a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember meetings of board members where Wolffly always repeated the same slogan – to smear Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the “tournament table” to which the successes of the banks were brought.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of this journey.
UBS was the largest player in the trading of currency and government securities.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot. According to the parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has had flaws in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. substandard securities.
It evolved into a large mechanism that combined U.S. mortgage-based securities and sold them onwards – continuing to take risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS did not stop.
“UBS bought it until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have become a children's game with chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
In front of anyone who heads this huge bank, there is an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Geiger, a banking analyst, already has an idea – to give up investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that the investment activity needs to be significantly squeezed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss banker was only seen as a temporary decision when the bank suddenly split up with its predecessor Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to show character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, leads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to bring the investment bank back to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Weber.
He has only publicly said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
The next year.
Fears of recession in Europe pull down U.S. stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of U.S. investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not have much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis could be overcome in the womb.
The overall relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems are back to the forefront, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12,078 with a drop of 0.6 percent.
The market barometer during trading fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in the eurozone’s 17 countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of growth.
The Eurostat statistical service reported that in September, the company produced two percent less than in the previous month.
"We're not on the island. We depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to shake the recession quickly and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears. In an interview with CNBC, he said it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European public bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a ten-year-old principle into the garbage bin and invested in the U.S. high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars has raised the price of shares of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The shares closed, almost unchanged, at the level of $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The stock price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all of its remaining stake in China’s Construction Bank into cash, earning $6.6 billion.
The bank is mainly planning to maintain its share of net sales profits in order to comply with more stringent regulations.

The stock price rose by 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 series aircraft for a total cost of $18 billion.

Invented robberies fill cities
Grapes are considered problematic birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to drive out of cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Vorons have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise, in many settlements are becoming more and more.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposium dedicated to crocodiles, in the city of Ler in East Frisia, experts argued that it is no longer possible to expel players from cities.
Experts from all over Germany have discussed possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Conservationists claimed that the root of the problem in cities was migration of particularly protected gametes, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional residential areas.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting out of traditional trees for nesting have complicated the life of birds.
The burglars are under protection.
In the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the north-western part of Yverdon, Dipholce, Achim under Bremen and Lera there are large colonies with more than 600 parent couples.
The ambiguous project of shooting ravens in Le<0xC3><0xA8>re caused disapproval of newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics have described catching birds in traps and hitting them with sticks as special cruelty.
"Ordinary movement and intimidation don't give anything," said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Leir.
Collapsing a water jet nest or tree bark often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are dispersed, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas.”
Intimidation is possible only in the form of an exception near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them. Get rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from the surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kellner.
The combination of deterring birds from areas in need of protection and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Informative stands instead of benzopil" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational funerary route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of very thoughtful gamers.
The project is already attracting tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion on the noise complaints made by birds. "Noise conveys a lot of information. They have to tell each other a lot."
The mind and mind of these birds have entered the legends. The jackals often not only use the tools to capture the looking piece, but also make the tools themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested a measure of the bird's mind on four scales.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on the plate to get a moth larva.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone needed to hit the plate.
In another experiment, the prudent gamblers had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers placed a small vedero with a pencil larva in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get their prey with a snail.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used hooks to grab the wand behind the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have dealt with this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012 <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks to win at the last minute were not long maintained.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the last places in the Euro 2012 championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfecting their fifth Euro exit after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of play-offs against Montenegro's outsider after a clean win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the rest of the goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional player Zvezdan Misimovich and captain Emir Spachic reduced the difference by two points thanks to an effective penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulich received the second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already kicked Bosnia out of the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal made an excellent start at the Lisbon Estadio da Lus.
Ronaldo took an early start, taking a free kick at the gate from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-distance skills, with a 25-meter mark increasing the score to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half hour, got their first chance thanks to the attacking Edin Jeko.
A former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball with his head to the bottom of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Ira<0xC4><0x8D>ek scoring for Czech Republic
Then in the center of attention was Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergoulding.
Following the attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player simulated, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing with his hand after the foil Fabius Quantran - Misimovitch implemented it.
After the break, the European vice-champions in 2004 secured the score with four more goals.
Peter Iiracek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are sent to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled at the team of coach Mikhail Bilek and the legionnaires of the Bundesliga, Mihael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could be catastrophic.
The goalkeeper Peter Chech in the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented the potential goalkeeper Tomash Sivok.
The best chances for Montenegro were when there was a duet of Stefan Yovetich and Deyan Damyanovich on the field.
In the 40th minute, Damyanovych struck from the edge of the penalty area and nearly scored the goal of Chech.
After the bar broke, she saved the already battered Czech world-class goalkeeper after forward FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after a 0:3 loss in Istanbul, the Turks were not able to play better than a 0:0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now virtually no doubt that the coach of the team Gus Hiddink will now liberate his place on the team's bench, which reached third place in 2002, the Croatians for the fourth time are in the final round of the European Championship.
The Turks managed to start almost perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir stadium.
Seljuk Inana's long shot in the seventh minute hit the pole, and the attacker Kazym Kazym failed to hit the ball in the net.
After that, Croatia woke up and increasingly captured control of the game.
After the break the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
The legions of the Bundesliga Daniel Prani<0xC4><0x8D> (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x87> of the Wolfsburg team, who gave up Ivan Peri<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87> from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first Euro exit after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - who had already looked confident in their place after winning 4-0 in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal by Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the guest team compared the account in the 57th minute.
Ireland had a good pace from the start, but only in the 23rd minute did Robbie Keen of Los Angeles make the first clean goal kick.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed not to let him take Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing goalkeeper Paul Londack's defense, Ward was in the right place and, dropping the ball through the line, changed the account by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China over the next few years.
The company, which is part of the Dax listing, said on Thursday that it intends to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more opportunities for research and development and employ thousands of people,” said Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s executive directors, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The state must grow from 2,500 to 4,500.
The global market leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this country, experiencing an economic boom, there are about 4,000 SAP customers from more than 176,000 worldwide.
China’s growth forecast is an important component of the company’s 2015 strategy, which is included in the Dax listing.
SAP plans to increase turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the company from Valdorff earned about 12.5 billion euros.
The business of a software provider with 55,000 employees around the world looks better than ever before.
SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on informatization in China.”
Mass Murder - A Human Dimension <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A tense and very good new book by Peter Englund, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal Story of the First World War, begins with a long list of actors from which the heart dies.
Here’s a tip to read on: Carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund tells you, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at the moments when, like one of these men and women, you will get off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's written right now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "work on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are hardly any ambassadors, skilled journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat equipment.
It’s not so much a book about what it was, it’s a book about what it looked like, it’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences and state of mind.”
The book "Beauty and Sorrow" was a joint experience of 20 years of war of more or less remarkable men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanical scientists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and servants.
Some of these people are going to be heroes.
Someone gets into captivity, loses an arm or leg, goes crazy, or dies.
Their lives are sparkling here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some will be extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the notion that the First World War was only a serious burial war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee oli; one of them encounters Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the cece fly.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling like smokeless dust.
When a canon is heard nearby, and you are a woman and you are at home with children, will you stay on the spot or run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Almost no one understands what is happening and why it is necessary to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and sorrow" traces the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Navy.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories of their lives may be terrifying or exciting, but they are alive to the highest degree thanks to Mr. Englund’s collected little moments and details.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, Erzaz is everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, unreal rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about turkey food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice boiled in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shell; shoes covered with wood."
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some of the stories tell about honor and courage.
One American notices in himself a craving for cruelty and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey squirrel, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and a cigarette squirrel."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice and not be upset.
“When a person settles for the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen to the public,” he writes.
But on the contrary, it's awfully similar to the "convicted man who's secretly hanged."
Other remarks concern the old Europe, which is collapsing, and the new types of fear.
“Conflict has become increasingly an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war of factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the new century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched suit that fits the incision sitting at the writing table.”
People act in an unforeseen way: low-level acts are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who tried to subtract venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in hopes of getting to the hospital,” he writes.
"The desperate ones rubbed him in the eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated with the Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is flexible, but uncomplicated, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's "The Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich-Maria Remark's "On the Western Front Without Change" rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unpainted pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he's out of the book reaching up to a page with a list of characters, taking it out of your hands and burning it with a splash.
After the previous mistake - a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some in protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because there should be fewer people in Zukotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, the rest of whom were initially told that they were going to the exercises.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the event, his presence underscored how much importance the Department of Police gave to operations.
There could be no mention of repetition of such episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of liquefied gas against protesters, which contradicted the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation to free the protesters of Zukotti Park began.
The authorities were preparing to watch the occupations unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were carried out on the island of Randels with a calculation on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called trainings in the event of riots - counter-terrorism measures for the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with regard to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", - said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was mentioned only as "training".
“The few cops I know and who were called to the case didn’t say they were being sent to Zukotti Park,” the man said, speaking anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who sneered inside before the deadline, hearing about these plans.
The operation on Tuesday was attended by employees of various police units, including district forces - police teams, which were usually used to control the criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night the right time for the attack.
“It was the right thing to do when there are fewer people in the park,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with headlights and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The headlights and pre-recorded announcements from the speakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue windmills, many protesters simply picked up their belongings and left.
Police said the tents did not touch until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to get inside in case the park needed arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the police department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been allowed to see how the police work, and that the police have treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with TV cameras on Church Street, along the park's western border, could take the picture.
When police went west through a chest of personal belongings of protesters, including bags, plastic blankets and plastic bags, full of clothes, the Sanitary Department’s teams followed her, collecting what was thrown.
Some of the protesters, who refused to leave, were taken outside, photographs of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police came in, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp shook hands together.
And two people clinging to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
In order to cut the castles, rescue workers were called.
No arrests in the park were made until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people had been arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for “violation of public order and resistance during detention,” he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department’s search police, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operation," Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Siddhartha Street, in case they needed to get inside.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw how from these positions the police expanded the perimeter even further beyond the borders of Zukotti Park.
At one point, the observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, expelling people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, eyewitnesses said, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The trade union of the staff of the schools will submit to the city for dismissal
The union, which represents hundreds of school staff who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of disproportionate influence on schools where the poor learn.
The trial is probably the last remedy available to the trade union of the District Council 37, which is trying to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the coordinator for working with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their jobs in the office of the staff on October 7, as a result of what the leaders of the trade union called a political reaction.
City officials categorically rejected the charge.
At the City Council hearings last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the council members parroted him, telling him that there was nowhere in the budget to indicate that the school's assistant staff would be fired.
Representatives of the 37 district council reported that they had approached the notice of the claims, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit to the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education will be identified as defendants and eight temporary employees will be listed as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as will most of the assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint, which was available to the New York Times, the union focused on a number of layoffs in schools in the city’s poorer areas to support the claims that more people are not being treated unfairly and that poor schools are being treated unfairly.
He points out that while there were no redundancies in Staten Island and there were few in the Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school assistants lost their places in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in District 9 and District 8.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at a free 36 high school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for the failures in the home.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The trade union also claims that the school directors could have been misled by the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of the coordinators in working with the parents.
The notice used the word “overpayment”, although “overpayment” is more often referred to when a teacher from the school’s payment notice moves to the list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators working with their parents have been fired," the lawsuit reads, "and not just transferred."
Mission completed, Congress ready for agreement on Libya <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona), and Joseph I. Liberman (Nezamyn).
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of their support for their democratic aspirations by both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no other discussion of Libya has been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties quarreled with each other and the White House over the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
This left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purge – when Congress is angered enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually kick the ground out of her foot.
Then the events overcame the indecisiveness of the Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is admired by the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces for the support of their non-combatants and their coalition partners who have participated in the war.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or dismantle legislators, such as the June Bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
A spokesman for Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the House of Representatives’ Capitol this week is to vote in favour of a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House member Bob Goodlett (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of that convocation.
Other legislators have not yet been able to bring their amendments to the plenary session, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat amendment is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been brought up in this convocation.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments on a balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “Federal spending control”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors – mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes – the opportunity to boast that they have “drawn out” such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and House Speaker Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guaranteed, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another amendment banning the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states object to them.
As much as the members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th congressional convocation, 77 such amendments were proposed by lawmakers, while in the 110th, 66 were made.
This pace is sharpening compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment, the 27th, was passed in 1992, but it was actually introduced in Congress in 1789.
"Besieged, but not defeated," Gifffords said in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after the gunman shot at her in a public event in Tuscany, a member of the House of Representatives Gabrielle Gifffords (the Democratic Party, Arizona) reportedly went out of the shower on Monday night, the shower appeared on the federal channel, the shower, the soap opera.
Having appeared on the "20/20" ABC News with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had a hard time formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult way to recover from an injury by a bullet that smashed the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill on the debt limit.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifffords smiled, laughed and sang – and called her recovery “difficult.”
Asked how Sawyer felt, 41-year-old Gifffords replied, “Very good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special "20/20", which was shown on the eve of the release of the new couple's book "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope."
The special issue told about the recovery of the Giffords after the January 8 shooting.
On a video shot by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Kick your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word: "What."
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word - "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video, shown by the BBC, demonstrates that music played a central role in the recovery of Gifffords: we see the congressman sing along with the doctors “Girls just want to have fun” Cindy Looper and Tom Petty’s “Free Fall.”
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she doesn’t remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he read an article in the Giffords newspaper about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed then.
Suspected assailant Jerd Lee Lafner is held in a Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
“A lot of people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, “I’m defeated.”
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just beaten up.
And you'll go through this, you'll recover and come back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more pity than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
According to the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines built around it.
The audience in the smoking hall applauded him standing.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraising campaign.
The senior military officer at the concert, who was also the then chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really a respect, it was a pity.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American audience.
The soldiers are being praised for their victims.
But praise has its price, the military says.
The audience increasingly behaves as if it is feeling sorry for people in shape.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us like the unfortunate.”
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who don’t want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the recent years of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
As a result, most conversations about grief take place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons had returned from fighting in the Marine Corps, retired colonel Mark Kanshen warned them that non-military people would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they crushed the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is a “mask of a cruel evil veteran,” said Kanshn, who was fighting in Iraq and returning to a high-ranking government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers had carefully asked if he could withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the campaign.
Kanshen recalls how he told his sons, “When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect.”
The inconvenience experienced by the military comes in part from American indifference to wars.
Victories on the battlefield are rarely given praise from a country that is little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as it was perfectly normal in World War II,” said retired lieutenant-general David Bernow, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of the military.
The troops are estimated by the number of marches they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of losses.
The Army Faces Increasing Pressure from Supporters to Combat Rape
This week’s historic hearings will decide whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army on charges of non-violent rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be in line with the next.
Elizabeth Lyman, a 25-year-old first-class rowwoman and 11 weeks pregnant, was reportedly raped by her co-worker at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a male co-worker carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman said.
But the native of Texas dismissed her concerns.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts back then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, stabbed and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be eagerly awaiting the court’s decision at the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether or not the trial will go to the court against him.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by attorney Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men who all claim not to have been prosecuted after having been raped or threatened with sexual coercion.
Burke says she was targeting senior army officials because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence?
Burke also says that about 400 other victims have been contacted since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - it will open up a lot of cases if necessary to maintain pressure.
The defense team from the Department of Defense under the leadership of federal prosecutor Neil McBride has taken steps to end the case.
The court documents Newsweek received reveal a defense strategy—mainly that former or current soldiers can’t make claims by the army for the damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court ruling by the Ferres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents said.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the battle, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women ' s military teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacts with local women in the combat zone.
The result: in the period between the two wars, 150 female soldiers died - two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s also time for the military to become modern, Berke said.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a woman-hating atmosphere.
Separately, the non-profit association of American veterans of war in Vietnam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, at the center of which diagnoses "personality changes" that are put to the victims of violence in order to remove them from the service of the right-wing organizations - a common phenomenon, according to such activists, A.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Office of Veterans Affairs, accusing him of discriminatory practices to consider pension applications from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures have been brought to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported, according to the Sexual Violence Prevention and Combating Service of the Ministry of Trafficking.
But, as we know, the attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of litigation cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases were brought to court - twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The defendants in Burke's case call the attacks on them only the first in a series of other injuries.
In the Lyman case, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape 11 times the fiancée of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the assailant - from a cut in her hand - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing during which she was asked if she had had sex with a friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman said.
"I thought I was giving birth now - I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I came out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial for me.'"
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her colleagues on the lawsuit is a complex issue, says John Terry, a law professor at the University of Washington’s George Washington Law School.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been criticizing the Ferres Doctrine all my life.
The army has been lagging behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents that it imposes on responsibility.
He adds: “Chances are largely against them ... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when decent people are willing to fight.
If the hearing isn't in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens sooner.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was an ordinary guy who outlined his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to committing a mass murder in Norway in July, which killed 77 people, appeared at his first open court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone on the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that it was easy to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism at the UK’s DEMOS Research Centre.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to highlight the necessary demographic with scientific accuracy — that marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pushed them into advertising, but instead of showing them a new group or dietary product, the ad offered the user a survey that included questions about their own level of education, attitudes to violence and violence.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even leaving the office.
“This is a completely new way of doing research,” says Bartlett.
Some results are not as striking: online right-wing supporters are mostly young men, dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor.”
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world – from health issues to social trends that are expressed in Laika, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three records a day, Facebook’s “super-actual information” is causing a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles titled the site by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people who can’t be approached on the street with a notepad.
“In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party and they would never accept you,” Bartlett said.
"Facebook excludes all of this - you address them directly."
Others say that with the help of this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Meghan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as their dormitory mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunken statuses too often.
“You can’t solve the problem without identifying it,” said Dimitri Hristakis, co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We found a way to identify children from the risk group that would otherwise not have been detected.”
Facebook is also constantly extracting various kinds of data about its users.
The data processing group of the site processed statistics on the status of relations and St. Valentine's Day, the appearance of the voters in the middle of the term in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using their data, which is a collection of information that is made widely available to them only, - the champions of cyber freedom.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrubble with a friend thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined norms for conducting offline research, online data is available to the public.
“I don’t think many users have at least thought about what the researcher can look at their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about the study he conducted in 2006 using the publicly available student pages on Facebook.
“As far as they could imagine, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the object of the study is extremely honest.
It is not possible to know on Facebook how much information in the profile and on the user’s page is true.
“What you say on Facebook, and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things,” says Selvin.
That’s why, despite years of work in technology research, Selvin thinks that notebooks and pens are still the best research tools out there that can be used.
“Nothing can replace getting out into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still going offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Breivik will appear in court for the first time
Anders Bering Breivik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance and Knights Templar of Norway," he told 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I confess to the actions, but I do not confess to the guilt."
Judge Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech with him, to speak to relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would take all visits and correspondence under strict control for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he was kept under lock.
Everyone came to find the answers to their questions.
“I thought it looked cold and inhuman,” one of the survivors told the Norwegian channel NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but personally it got a little easier after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue collar, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange idea that he was part of the big "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
"I would like him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of one of the victims.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Lost Interview Showed in Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can count as the biggest discovery in a recently rediscovered interview, which they recalled in advance of previews in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also an avid organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business executives suffered from the "difficultness of the hardest to think of a great product".
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the TV series Triumph of the nerds about the emergence of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs on a uniquely lengthy conversation.
It’s been about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he’s already been working at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of mass Internet development.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview were missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which comes out at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unaccustomed to present his technological philosophy and business strategy here.
And unbelievably thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers – reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be precise.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems to be irritated by Kringley’s questions, prompting him to move faster on to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In a pre-Pixar film, the iPods and iPhones The Lost Interview is something more prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about the posthumous assessments of Jobs’ work, but there’s something hurtful and inspiring about Jobs, which we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
“Throughout the whole time in business, I kept asking, ‘Why are you doing this?’ And the answers you always get are, ‘Oh, that’s just how it’s done.’
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline the reporting at Apple.
Disrupted by the way of recording expenses, often beginning with "standard expenses" that were taken from the ceiling and then adapted with "clarification", he created an automated structure that ensured that they would be able to track business expenses to the smallest extent.
A joke about the father:
Jobs talks in detail about the “blue box” he mastered with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and call long distances for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but Jobs’ euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He recounts how he and Wozniak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We covered the globe half a dozen times, and you yelled at the vending machine, and it penetrated a minute later into the neighboring vending machine,” Jobs said with a smile.
“We were young, and all we’ve learned is that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
“The two of us knew a little bit, but we could master a little thing that could control a big thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could ever come up without it.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail one famous exit, which he and Vozniak practically copied, calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, the two were smiling just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and Bill Hullett's cold calling):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hullett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at Hullett Pacard.
“It made a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the very first desktop computer.”
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to drive at HP as a teenager and scrolled around that car and wrote programs for her.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several places the interview Jobs talks about inventing new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of assembly boards, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on the loan, he had to think about both assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced while developing a computer mouse:
“I remember the angry quarrels... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was soaked in my throat, and I came out, and I found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About the big companies that lose energy:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs predicted exactly how many industry leaders would be mistaken in the vision of the situation and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copy or printer, and what?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who ultimately come to the management of companies, and the people who make the product are pushed from the decision-making platform.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is driven out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products – the required skill.
That’s what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be a Microsoft 90x...
They were defeated by victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of skillful work ... when you unfold a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises you need to go to – some things you won’t be able to make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You need to keep in mind 5,000 ideas - these concepts, - connecting them all together...
Ultimately, it all comes down to taste – it all comes down to trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later – trying to bring it into what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with health law opponents as the court examines the case
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether it would listen to President Obama’s health law rollout, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, paid tribute to the court’s dinner, sponsored by a law firm that will be a law firm.
The case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition’s submissions for consideration.
One of the issues on the agenda was a petition supported by 26 states challenging the rapid health care review passed by Congress last year, a bill that unified conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the 5 1/2-hour spin-off debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle in the presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time a court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the health care law should be repealed will most likely be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual lunch, a long-standing group that consistently advocates conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the court's hearing.
He was present, among others, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
Honorary guests for lunch, Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not inconsistent with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest or a mention in the program of such an event.”
However, the apparent closeness of Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as well as to the company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning violation of ethics and indifference to the Code contradicts statements by some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
“The judges drank and had dinner at an official fundraising event with lawyers whose cases are now being considered in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for the event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to the critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups such as the Federalist Society in the cases.
Thomas's wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue with respect to Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal objections against the law were filed at the first instance court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refrain from hearing the case because she was too involved in defending the law at the time to be impartial now.
Kagan did not show that she was going to do that.
Boeing Receives Record Order of 18 Billion for Aircraft
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777s and may order another 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal - more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer, and the price tag for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold lived on future orders for aircraft.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial jets - 50 two-way Boeing 777s.
An incredible order was received from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price tag up to $26 billion, Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which can boast a significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price tag for six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neil Diora said.
“The quality of these specific buyers is quite high.”
Many of the Middle East’s airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for airplanes, but also the increase in fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, since this is one of their biggest expenses items, is not so destructive because the country makes money at high prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order of aircraft when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have a natural defense,” he said.
The order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the broad-haul aircraft market and helps prevent Airbus SAS from attempting to gain dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing’s victory at the air show came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axial load after buyers demanded to increase the load capacity and range of the flight.
Boeing Co’s shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's Sister Has Apparently Lost in Michigan Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers helped the opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Calderon’s sister, Felipe Calderon, did not appear to have run for governor of Michigan during the tough state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the place of governor of the western state is named Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
“Intervention of organized crime throughout the election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday’s vote.
“They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the elections... They took the ballot boxes, put obstacles... and made people vote for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing for a comeback, and the victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly outperformed Calderon, who led the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND, led by her brother, refused to recognize Valejo as the winner.
Silvano Auréoles, a candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DPR, which now holds the governor’s chair, came third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denied contact with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Michigan, drug cartels, specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines, have long dominated.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues to this day.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however terrible the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n may look, victory will give the party’s driving momentum.
The man who should represent IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very exciting in the front door next year."
ABR Convinces Asia to Help Save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has forced India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from Europe’s debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ABR’s Manila office, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to speed up the currency bloc’s recovery with either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries looked at Europe’s difficulties “unbiased,” and said that Asia’s side-by-side financial assistance with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
“It’s all about us.”
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
“So if China and India can help, it has to be done.”
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowings have grown menacingly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The ongoing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could bring the world economy back into recession, and led to calls from leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nog predicted that any Asian aid would be made through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation – such as buying EU financial aid bonds, a means to ensure financial stability in Europe – is providing enormous strength to Asian partners in negotiations.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said India will “do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a reduction in foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy,” he said.
“We have great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a possible option, it’s an obligatory condition, because where we’ll find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that for emerging economies like India, there is no point in helping the rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warsaw, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be very difficult politically to help Europe for the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will learn that the Greeks retire at age 50 and go to the holidays to the sea, and it will not be well received,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly-organized, loss-making enterprises such as geese.
Mr. Nog said that the eurozone crisis is threatening “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
ABR’s forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “reducing risks” due to a threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to draw up “extraordinary plans” to protect themselves from the decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon’s Scary Warnings About Potential Reductions in Defense Expenses
Defense Minister Leon Panetta slammed the situation on Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but now fears that additional $600 billion or more could be inevitable if Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona and Republican Lindsay Graham of South Carolina.
He said Congress's inability to accept a budget deal and the resulting so-called sequester initiate a general reduction of 23% and the cessation of many new projects.
"Such a sharp reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfeasible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and will cause serious damage to other attempts to modernize," Panetta wrote in a letter to senators.
“We will also have to forcibly fire many of our staff, and since the cut will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire staff to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to our military readiness.”
The cuts will ultimately affect the military units, Panetta said.
"Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the Sequestrian, military achievements will seriously suffer from a serious breakdown in the main budgets," Panetta warned.
“Contract staff will be reduced, which will end with the cancellation of the contracts and the supervision contract that supports the troops.”
“State personnel will be reduced, which will lead to late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted.”
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequence of the sequestration in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We stand firm against these draconian actions,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday evening, when they released a letter to the Panetta.
“It’s not the way we can live, and it’s not the way we have to impose it.”
“Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether the letter from the Panetta or the senators’ latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise, or will intensify calls for the Pentagon’s release from cuts, we’ll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about the possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon’s leadership after many years of conducting budget scrutiny in Congress and the White House and realizing that he is facing a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense drew a shattered picture of what could follow — troops with a shell, but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free squadron."
“It’s the wing of the plane without enough pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in her introductory remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from an unsustainable fighting spirit, poor preparedness, and unable to fight potential enemies.”
“In essence, it encourages aggression.”
In the appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he expressed new details about how the cuts “generated significant operational risks: slowing down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters” in the mines; the operations are not in the mines; the operations are in the mines; seriously limit our ability to be the first time in the mines.
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 fighter jet, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone battleship, and a new ground-based combat vehicle, which the Army and the Navy will need.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it’s a vital next step in improving and countering potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A fleeting look at the latest headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous deceptions and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential nominee Herman Kane is busy contesting accusations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania has been charged with misrepresentation as they allegedly hid that a retired football coach raped the boys, according to the report.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested when he told U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroys careers and shakes countries.
New York Congressman and Internet-exhibitionist Anthony Weiner has posed himself as a fool, denying his findings, which was quickly refuted by undeniable evidence.
Former Presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with financial fraud during a campaign related to the secrecy of extramarital ties.
And again, none of those who lived at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, smuggled into a lie about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky during his second term in office.
The history of fraud on exams in school and college is a common thing.
There have been instances where teachers gave students answers to the tests so that they themselves had a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Teachers who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In one day, as studies show, you can lie 10 to 200 times.
Now it is assumed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times during the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Identifying a lie or discovering a lie is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, similar to, say, charades, where it is necessary to call "Catch!", the detection of lies is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected by physologists for the last six decades of researches and projects in prestigious universities, all-embracing.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been dispelled.
The liars are staring into the eyes.
They don’t always stop, sneeze, blush, or blush.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to spot and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can come to the truth by observing the structure of claims, mimicry, structure of questions, and temporal characteristics.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries in an extensive and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lies, and it's clear that detecting lies is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps to refocus or manage knowledge in our complex world.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel unforced, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women — about others — usually to protect someone’s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but the lie they tell most often).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty about deceiving you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, look at the normal behavior of your object.
This is called “determination of the original state”.
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Observe the pose, laughter, and vocal characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly tapping his legs in a normal state, then you will not be making unfair accusations when you see the tapping of his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as proof of deception.
Scammers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean toward the exit, change their position in a certain way, or demonstrate "relaxation after interview" - this exaggerated sigh of relief and laughter.
Investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation signal to simply look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson has turned himself in and used the past, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, which has led to her searches across the country.
Suffering people can also use distancement in speeches: “I haven’t had sexual relations with this woman ... Miss Levinsky” or repeat a complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are hardly catchable.
Someone can use the “qualification language” when answering a difficult question: “Well ... to be honest ... as far as I know ... as far as I know.”
This makes the response more emotional than factual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic tool to detect a lie, but you can master the skill of detecting a lie.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming a victim of skilled scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial plan for construction of oil pipeline needs to be revised after U.S. threat to postpone its approval
A few days later, after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering the trade unions, but reassuring them that it would reassure the environmental defenders -- a company that was not going to build.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still get approval.
The company voiced this decision at a press conference in the State Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, albeit on a different route.
This comes after the State Department said last week that it would postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Sand Hills of Nebraska and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground water reserve.
“This is a real step forward,” said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental examination ordered by the State Department is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision interfered with the policy.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision a call from the State Department, and expressed his support.
The 1,700-mile oil pipeline will run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It is expected to ship 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to oil refineries in Texas.
To do this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but likes trade unions that hope for about 20,000 jobs linked to the oil pipeline.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers opposed the plan are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Sand Hills area and the Ogalla aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the State Department on the impact on the environment has shown that the project will have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source of the report on the energy industry report has stated that the auditor of the Department has ordered the results.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another was whether the choice of the company that was hired to conduct the initial research was inappropriate, as it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle is sued for allegedly causing the child to feel nauseated by fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patty LaBell began swarming in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, intimidating their young daughter to such an extent that she was terrified.
The tirade of the actress "Lady Marmalade" scared 18-month-old Geneva Monk so much that she endured "personality change, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers," - says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on November 10 last year, when the working scene Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten educator Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Rosana Monk landed in the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
“Someone came up to me from behind and said, ‘You know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to pick her up,” she said.
LaBelle made an angry apology to a pregnant woman.
“She said aggressively, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter by the door,’” said Rosanna Monk.
“I said to her, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’”
She got angry and began to use gossip -- the word in C and the word in F, -- in elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva's had a hysteria.
“I told this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her companions had to hold her and push her into a waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The baby was crying so much that she was upset, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle a note apologizing, but did not receive a response.
Lawyer and representatives of LaBell are not responding to calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it will receive, for charity to children, who have cancer.
“The goal is to get Patty LaBella to be responsible for her actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially with regard to a kindergarten educator with an 18-month-old child on his hands.”
Climate change has slowed the economy.
During the first year of Mario Lopez's reign, unemployment and the illegal labor market rose, foreign funding declined and the economy weakened.
2011 is the year that will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as related to the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Waldes, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for the development of the economy, but, given the development of the foundations was unfavourable with the climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, growth was not.
The low temperatures of February not only led to losses of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the opportunities of growth of the state economy, causing a reduction in economic activity in total by 3.6 per cent in the second half of the year, mainly due to a historic fall of 31.
According to the report on the areas affected by the frost provided by the Council of Mexico for Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in their entirety, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were affected in part.
The decline in the economic activity of the labour force has caused a decrease in the labour force of the labour force by the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the State of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the labour force of the force of the labour force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force, by the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force, by the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force, until of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force, until of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force, until of
Reduction of liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the course of the year has been shaken by many factors, for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, by the actions taken in the states.
“What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market in order to limit resources imposed by the law, which was passed in Congress, to prevent them from laundering money,” he said.
Stopped Immigration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States was limited, first of all because of the difficulties with entry, and secondly - because, once it has gone into work - it has gone out of work, they are already faced with a lot of difficulties in finding work, so the group
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa’s labor market is getting worse if we take into account the large number of violations that predominate in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and malpractice, another reminder of work in the state is low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos until September, much lower than the country average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of PII
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest flow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the PII of the state in the period of 14 years was in the period of $630.697.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly came to companies in the service sector.
Debt
Against the background of the economic downturn, the state government in July during the state congress requested approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities in a number of countries, and a number of countries have not been able to revive the economy, at the local level was approved.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdes demonstrates a lack of government capabilities.
Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of coordination of the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work a lot to get back the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of all of us and, first of all, we will be able to achieve a good and synchronized work of our new government.”
Deceleration of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as the early frosts this year have halted the state’s economy and its effectiveness and growth have been limited.
“The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including the frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which does not become fast enough to create economic dynamics, which allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services at the end of the year.”
Revision of direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better direct the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is a lot more to do,” he said.
He is sentenced to eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days' income - such a sentence was handed down to a citizen of Navolato for storing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office said that convicted drug dealer Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandwal, convicted of a crime against health, in this case the storage of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling Cipriano Valdes Street, in front of Post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the wheel of a white car pickup truck, in which he carried a black bag in a box in the car, and on the passenger seat - a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the extract was handed over to the Second District Court, and the accused continues to be incarcerated at the Criminal Justice Center.
You need to make contributions to the work
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of being unfinished or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while the work programmes had so far been developed, they were in jeopardy, as the State Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state had to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so there was still a possible delay in their completion.
“They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven’t given us a penny since the beginning of July when they were supposed to give us a share,” he said, “so we don’t delay, we started work and they’re very advanced, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Agillar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the term the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million states, the amount that was not provided in that case.
“This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn’t have the financial opportunities to participate, and the programs continued to develop, and this year, in order to access these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state has left behind,” he explained.
While the State authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that the interest on them came as quickly as possible.
“They have to bring in almost 12 million, and even if the year is over, they didn’t give us a penny.”
The court approves the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals to digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has made in recent years.
The Supreme Court has rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which carries the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as it has not received the eight votes needed for its cancellation.
A minority of the four ministers, including the President of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, believed that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his powers by issuing a decree detailing the actions to transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to make a decision on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in the law of the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislation.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to figures.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without engaging in discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive power could not determine the general rules of measures to be prepared for by the state administration.
“I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” he recalled that the planning of state policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is related to the federal executive power, which has a constitutional mandate, the government.
Replacing analog signals to digital signals is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, leading to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
A postponement of the transition, he said, would mean a postponement of the benefits of transformation into a digital form, which includes meeting social needs, which have not only a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political issues and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, “require the work of the whole system, formed on the principle of state economic governance, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution unites into the state executive power.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and did so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of narrowly specialized technical institutions.
From this, it cannot be concluded that the government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the powers of Congress, ensures compliance in the administrative sphere with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacan analyzes the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data transmitted to the PPV, the difference between the first and second places in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, amounting to 879 of the total of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is real, as regards the process of the elections this year in Michoacan, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PRV) the difference between the total number of votes in the first and second place in the general election is 7, the total number of votes in the second place in the governor's election is 27.
In light of this, the president of the General Council of the Institute of Elections of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the Electoral Corps approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal.
As it should be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, since the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in the law.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJC) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim made by the local legislature, and called "invalid and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state on constitutional reform "substantial" or "unentitled."
In an interview on the possibility of "voting by voice" Maria de los Angeles Llanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles, the General Council of the IVM will be able to present a partial or complete counting of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more electoral rolls may be made provided that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no voting record and counting of documents in the roll or it is not in the Chair; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the total count of votes in all polling stations may take place when there is a sign that there is a difference between the presumed candidate-winner of the elections in question and those who have received the second place in the polls and who have received the second place in the polls, less than or equal to one percent, at the beginning of the polls.
A general count of votes will also be made if at the end of the usual count it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one percent, provided that the percentages are equal to or equal to the percentage that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken the measure.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the ICTY, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 per cent, not even counting 129 votes out of the total number in the 923 protocols.
His Last Will.
Its dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; on Monday, an interrogation and a serene mass were held.
According to the family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was to dilute his powder in the mountains of Sapaliname.
After accepting condolences along with the other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Coauila aboard the Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people visited the ceremony in Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the dust of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where his family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m. he attended the Santilo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team that was a member of Felipe Basio during his high school education.
“His wish was to return to Saltillo, and for his powder to be scattered in the Sapaliname mountains, he always told his family and friends,” said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot’s sister.
In her opinion, the lieutenant-colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to enter the College of Aviation in Sapopane, Halisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that he had his head turned even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for his cousin’s graduation ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: driving an airplane.
He is taken on the last path.
The shots from the guns were fired at the Ulysses in Tessos in honor of the lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by the governor Jorge Torres Lopez, the people of the village and the government of the state, the Mexican army and the troops, from the Sixth Military Zone, Mexico itself.
Basio Cortes was killed recently when the helicopter he operated crashed, along with the provincial government secretary, José Francisco Blake Moroy, and six others, all of the department’s representatives.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortez (creamed), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martinez, to his maternal and other students, to the esplanade of his training school, where he was already waiting, including his family.
Three bodies found abandoned at the NL Caderet farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereita Chimenes, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was discovered on the 1.5-kilometer Cadereita Highway towards Santiago, at an altitude in the commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that in the village house, whose wall is painted in beige and brown, the gate was opened.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately gave notice to the relevant authorities.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Nearly one metre away was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them lay face down.
According to evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no shells on the scene.
On the fence of a village house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group to another, also in it and in the gates there are several holes from the bullets.
11 Caught in Cadet
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereita, and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to published information, initially on November 11, eight people were detained in the Los Alvero colony, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a phone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., military personnel made a patrol tour of the village of Staroe Rancho in Caderete, when he saw a car without a license plate with two men in the salon.
Stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 cartridges.
Later, following these statements, on November 13 at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped in the public land of La Pravda, which, upon seeing the military, was trying to escape.
He is accused of clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Cadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of an economic catastrophe.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of an economic catastrophe and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive body will take its positions.
Monty said he would present the president with the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
“The structure is now well outlined,” he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy struggled with the political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a package of hard-earned savings demanded by European leaders in order to restore confidence in Italy.
Under pressure from Monti to rush, volatile markets have set BTP Italy’s 10-year bond income at more than 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would actively support this government.”
We believe that this is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti’s chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, the party’s secretary for centrist law, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the governmental majority, consisting of technocrats formed by Monti.
Parliamentary support for
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to carry out reforms that will likely be unpopular reforms of hard-to-reach economy.
Any blockage or suspension of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
He'll finish his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy’s debt value has now reached a critical level against the backdrop of uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy with a debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial defenders.
Monty said his government would exist before the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread forecasts that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be composed only of technical experts, a testament to their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources said the parties’ mutual distrust and disagreements complicate an attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more game experience than Tikos.
Of the 22 players claimed in Spain, ten have already played in 50 international matches.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players claimed to have played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 players brought by both countries to a friendly today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world champions and Europe, the number one in the monthly FIFA ranking, have an entire list of Class A qualifying games, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have held 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez stadium.
Spanish footballers, playing in the League of All Stars and in the strong clubs of the Premier League of England, during this year were very active in the league and in local cup competitions, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
To this, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Fury in a difficult qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that leads the list in Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were recognized as the best last week of UEFA along with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 games and bomber Schalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Nearly approaching one hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres - with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Iniesta - with 62, Sesk Fabregas - with 61 and David Silva - with 53.
On the Costa Rica side next to Michael Umana, left side Junior Diaz with 48 games and bomber Brian Ruiz - with 45.
Furthermore, only five have crossed the border in 30 games: Keylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrandes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36, and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain with Gerardo Piccolo (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santa Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In the team with less than 30 exits on the field there is Roy Miller with 26 games, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn’t even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, Hordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Adder have not yet made their debut.
Spain's top player David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought in more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernandez and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet included the country on the tour in honor of a 20-year career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says that for them it is also a dream that has become a reality - to play in this country.
This was the statement of the bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America as part of a 20-year tour, and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Los Angeles team The X and the local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, a full decryption of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask about it because there is some loyalty to the band; the fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we took so much time to get here.
Some people, in anticipation of your concert, regard it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of stress to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We’ve had some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope that this has brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, and in terms of these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are great places to surf, that’s how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, one can say that you have done great shows with a lot of songs.
What were you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a wide variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore, I think, it makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour you celebrate 20 years of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could have ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we’ve been doing this for over 20 years makes it a dream.
We are delighted with our success and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Everything is going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the flowering of the grapefruit?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We are good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s healthy when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and it’s unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of a Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
“Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we’re happy to be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of the Seattle sound that turned out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, the four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many bands exist.
Firstly, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened, which give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be on the tour too long because it’s easy to get into this game by big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it did without deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we’re writing really good songs and it was great in the beginning.
We were a band for almost three years and didn’t release a single album until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of disappointment for me because it lasted so long, and most importantly, we are still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who have always had a lot of fun with us in the band, and when I hear a song or I see a picture, I think about it.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
Local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her for discovery?
Yes, the producers sent us a few videos, and it was a band that we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas has to offer live, and it must be very exciting.
Why are you constantly changing the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind are Gizer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the granite, despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a bit of a break from the word grunge.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of those that came along at the same time, and if it matters now, I think it's great because it's kind of cool when I'm making music.
At first your music was darker, and now it has become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It’s interesting because, I think, there are a few songs on the album that may seem lighter, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think when you grow up and you have had some trauma in your life and you have lost a family member or a friend, these events are starting to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Former President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized in a state hospital on Tuesday for an examination of the loss of muscle strength seen in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fuhimori, 72, who has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his tenure (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone surgery four times and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fuhimori will be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his opinion, Fuhimori should be a candidate for a pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want this because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, to which were added other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor said.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people by the forces of the army's destruction squad, which acted in secret during the first years of his rule.
Muhika is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties.
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Muhikoi and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the region’s political problems.
Muhika will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of the comprehensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the schedule.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “convenient for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations,” the South American leadership said on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking Calderon’s support for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the tax havens list at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked Uruguay’s protest and a recall for his ambassador’s consultations in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group created from the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in essence, an agreement with the South American country since January this year on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements in order to leave this “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, composed of countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax co-operation.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
Used plumbing will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Dude from Bowser’s evil feet, but he has never done so before in three dimensions: in “Super Mario 3D Land” he will fight for the girl’s love in stereoscopic technology.
The release, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is a hero who should tell us how stereoscopy without glasses will work," said Omar Alvarez, head of Spain's Nintendo press service, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform" because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
A spokesperson for Nintendo said that despite the existence in 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an “accessible” video game that allows you to enjoy fast and mobile gaming.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "easy" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go “in the second round” to the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real-time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "not be subject to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional Super Mario invasion also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which hasn't happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo tricks fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, the plumber with the axes needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the player will discover new moves, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "player" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo's extradition process had begun, so that he could answer in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
That concludes the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colum said his decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he had not "handed over" legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom has done shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts were exhausted in order to prosecute the former Head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court, Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of wasting Q120 million in the Department of Defense during the presidential term, which was a process prior to extradition, but the Department of Public Relations filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove’s social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social isolation have helped overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
To this, it is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the results of a ceremony held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born near the Velia Trinity in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, a lack of work, and drug problems or marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
A different political presentation during the elections showed the uniform nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Hordi Puchol, the ceremony was attended by the former consultant of the Socialist education, Ernest Maragal, and the former lieutenant of the mayor and current ecosocialist, member of the municipal council of Ricardo Goma.
He also appeared in Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Consultant, Josep Lewis Claris, and the CEO of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the universe of hope in people experiencing difficulties.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to it,” he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated.
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbours, at the decision of the court without the intervention of the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
“From now on, there will be bandwidth control here,” the manager said.
The squatters, who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest settled, assigned all of the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially cans from under alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a venue for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the club says the attackers of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the squot and, above all, by those who attended the soothing parties, the frequency and the intensities.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and it has been nine months since he "forgives" her the rent.
The city police have also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the municipal group PP, advisor Alberto Fernand Dias, last week called for "immediate evacuation of the building in order to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have emerged from neighbors and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that by the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months the squotters invaded all floors and almost every room and that in some of them there were burglaries.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the culture of the building.”
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building in New Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police took to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four of them were arrested immediately.
A park or a forest?
Architects Agree to Possibility of Competition After Disputes About Contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the rise of the now-defunct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital city of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SKB, in 1987 the park again took place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that are oriented not north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the wild cabanas as the Yogi bear.
That was the case until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions on many other gates in Colserola.
Under the gate is understood the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate in the field.
The question is one: a colserola? a park or a mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people get to know each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline it becomes "necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefon Cerda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“We have to admit that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complex,” says the architect, for whom the headline “the Colserola Gate” contains a “word trap”: we should not think of them “as an entry into the park, but as a restriction of some areas where we have to act.”
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayon with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks arising due to the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the 80s experience, which ended on the Forum's site "with its swan song".
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
“The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step,” I mean the transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools because the current [as far as the General Capital Plan (GDP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble.”
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which "not to be missed by the ears", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to join this project "from the very beginning".
And moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is something that should be led by interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues), which should have been created by: "A.
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, because the rules of the competition lack a common type of Colserola: "16 cross-competitions have been announced," he says, "in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no long reading here, and no long reading to be done.
This means that, at least in his case, 16 contests will be held.
On the other hand, the project for a single gate can be programmed and defined with the architect's project for a neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council must ensure that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt must provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, a Red Casino representative pardoned the mayor's brother in the lawsuit against him on extortion charges.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after a legal representative of Red Casino apologized to him before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting extortion proceedings against Monterrey’s brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic fee to allow the authorities of Monterrey to allow a secret operation in the gambling hall.
After a public conviction, the Prosecutor General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2 he was arrested and jailed for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He remained in that location for 49 days, following the second travel ban order after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderet for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with an average degree of inmate isolation because he was threatened with death.
Authorities allowed him to continue his stay at a municipal prison in San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigations, the evidence of Jonah’s guilt, such as the imposition of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of bookmakers, is quite obvious.
On Monday, Red Casino’s legal representative, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge Jose Luis Pesina to ask for pardons for the region’s mayor’s brother so he could be released in the next hours.
During the hearing, the prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gomez whether he compensated for the damages and which of the gambling house’s partners is granting pardons, although the lawyer tried not to pronounce the name.
On the basis of record 197/2011, legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and thereafter no claims can be made regarding the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation for damages and punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 3:50 p.m., it was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
The court clerk, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Perez Hacome talks about the details of the disaster, where Interior Minister Francisco Blake died, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained from the accident, during which the Minister of the Interior Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the yard of the yard of the yard of the apocalypse hit directly on the ground, in full condition.
During a press conference, Dionysio Perez Hacome, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements, which appear to show that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters where the device lost its flushing."
He also reported that the ship was designed for 19 people, respectively, it complied with the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of the impact do not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the ship, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which satisfies the corresponding requirements for the transportation of passengers.
The earth in this place has a deflection of seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the secretary said, the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that during the crash, the presidential helicopter was operated at cruise speed and that it happened on a soft rising ground.
“This information reinforces the hypothesis of a conventional summer maneuver at the time of the impact,” he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Perez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew should have visibility during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed to the border area between the city of Mexico and the state of Mexico, where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to cloudy conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower altitude and greater visibility in the Kuernavak Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording from the aircraft's radar coincide, probably before the impact, there was no loss of control or change of direction of flight.
Dispersion of debris on a small area:
The information still available indicates that the impact has hit the front and sidelines.
The scattering of the debris suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground in terms of structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster area there is still undetected evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there may have been multiple contacts with the earth.
During work on site, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the land has a deflection from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful research on a larger area than the outlined area near the site of the disaster, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in terms of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Search Program for the Obesity Gene
Social Protection Leads Study to Find the Gene of Obesity in Children and Young People; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, which has been dubbed the “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescenthood” protocol, which will give a count of signs associated with obesity.
In his statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in the field of Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Medical Center Miguel Cruz Lopez explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers was assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. children will be tested.
He stressed that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Quautemoca (west Mexico), and since October 8, the events are held at the sports center in Nesaualcoyote (east Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (North Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, and the main goal is to bring together 3,000 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with parental permission and under their supervision to fill out individual dietary questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), measurement of blood pressure and levels of glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are related to childhood) will be carried out.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects health care professionals’ concerns about an alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there was growth in just 6 years: in boys, 77 percent were obese, in girls, 47 percent were overweight, and in the case of overweight, there was also significant growth,” MSSI said.
He said that the rationale for finding markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that on average Mexicans are 65 percent descendants of American Indians, 30 percent descendants of Europeans, and five percent descendants of Africans, and this condition affected genes that are linked to diabetes and obesity.
He explained that basically, the consequence of obesity genetics is the inability of the body to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that a direct benefit for participants is a comprehensive assessment of children that can identify if they have any degree of excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with complete confidentiality, the doctors pass it on in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that need to be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main reasons that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, having the most of the day at home in front of the TV, and the use of transportation in small groups.
This is also due to the high calorie intake, that is, the increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamal, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic predisposition, analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM will be able to avoid cracks
Rafael Errera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality, environmentally and temperature-resistant.
If the signals sent by the roadside were given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 wells for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Errera Naher, researcher of the UNAM chemicals department, and adds that if the process
In his lecture Technological view of the pits, read in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, is developing polymer-modified bitumen for the production of mixtures with temperatures so close to the bitumen, but with the best comparison.
Errera Nacher said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are high molecular masses called asphalts, and others of which are low molecular masses called maltenes, which together give the road covering its characteristic.
The viscous behavior of a bitumen is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains its almost solid state, while at very low temperatures it retains its solid state.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but changes throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineering expert.
The chimfac scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which consists of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the topmost layers is bitumen, composed of small stones dropped into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is submerged in bitumen.
When driving vehicles and exerting efforts, it helps the forces to distribute very well on the road cover.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt coating, he added, the last layer is placed, which is called the wear layer, which is made of a small stone, actually sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the transport wheels, it must have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road covering that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires the appropriate thickness, and it is necessary to take into account the material from which it is made.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of the asphalt.
When the soil is raw, water penetrates into the coating and it is difficult to get out of it, this causes softening of all layers of the coating and, therefore, the formation of pits.
With the formation of pits, he said, the first layer of wear is worn and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur immediately, this process should be paid attention to when the first signs of the current repair programs.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be associated with the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met to prevent the frequent occurrence of holes.
Rafael Errera said that there is still a lot to be learned about bitumen and to do, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help to fix holes with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valais lack to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valerie has been awarded the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, the only thing left to do is to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be pleased that she was on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and ribbon, proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the result of Al-Hayyyah (89), Al-Hayyyah (89), Al-Hayyyah (89), Al-Hayyyah (89), Al-Hayyyah (89), Al-Hayyyah (89), Al-Hayyyyah (89), Al-Hayyyyah (89), Al-Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
A question that many are asking right now:
What wasn't enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the speeches demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was chosen by the Corona Corona Queen Police or the Corona Corona Corona Corona and the Corona Corona Corona Corona, the most beautiful face by the version of the Vogue, the titles
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to answer convincingly the question “What book characterizes you and why?” asked by Martin Murilla Gomes from the literary society Let’s read.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood – Little Prince – is quite a deep book.
Today I am reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this moment I am reading the book of Irina Nemirovsky, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called “The Fire of Blood”.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term “culturation” and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the quoted books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "the universe is wise, what should happen."
And all of you, please, read at least a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses outlined, Valerie was burned out of favouritism.
The reporter from Bogota suggested that, because she was preferred, she was met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (culinary competition of Osterya, a spectator's vote as a result of a no-frills vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Mother).
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit on Hilton Beach and during her two appearances at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic demonstrated.
Ariel Ossorio, a reporter for RCN's Like Home, said the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that the candidate who wins more awards during the contest doesn't become queen."
In addition, the representative of Valé has recently avoided communicating with the press and this was incorrect.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valé has failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Dotti said they were looking for a woman committed to their country’s social needs.
“One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we need to look not only at the appearance, but also focus on the public consciousness before they take part in the contest, they should already be involved in the projects,” she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative of Valé was guilty of defects in the buttocks and fibrosis, which was seen on her abdomen, but this is controversial, as the jury especially noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsive work.
Queen Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orosco, a consultant, said Melina did not have the best body she could have had, “but the problems of fibrosis on her stomach, which were not very noticeable to me, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Ojos of Cromos believes that the mistake of the representative of Vale de Cauca was that she had undergone surgery.
"Operations are good, but Valerie does not know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the brutal prediction came true last night, saying it was the guy Raymond gave to Melinha as compensation for losing the pleasure of winning the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact is that today Melina begins the year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions indicated directly by the organizers of the National Contest.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens, who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A criminal from Cali entered history as a person who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI criminal Cali entered history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC chief Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working for CTI, this week, it was the turn to "deploy" Elizaro Gonzalez, a Puerto-Texas man who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzales worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to go through the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valais and after completing the corresponding courses he became a specialist in the field of forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and palms.
In the week of Elizar’s operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take off his clothes for no more than three days.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Caucasus to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of the prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research group at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints aren't lying.
Using magnifying glass, ink, blade and flashlight, Elizar compared the body’s fingerprints with those that were in the photos.
His eyes were not opened: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSC.
Searching for fingerprints
For a specialist in the field of dictilloscopy of the Sijin unit from Cali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizaro Gonzalez at a press conference on the operation against Kano, is particularly significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactilloscopy is a rigorous science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the detection of crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, dictilloscopy specialists take part in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
When arrested, many criminals have fake IDs or do not have documents.
We take their prints and look for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the event of the theft he had to carry a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief was holding hands to master a safe full of jewels and money.
“It’s hard to work with the walls because they’re not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and establish the identity of the perpetrator who took part in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles from under a liquor around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a suspected relative could have committed the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A specialist in dictilloscopy from CTI explained that in places where there are fingerprints, a chemical or physical reagent is applied.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
After that, fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered in the registry.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch, leaves footprints.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angry people challenge the authorities of New York <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Hundreds of protesters smashed the camp in front of Zukkotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court’s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park nearby.
On Tuesday, members of the "Captain Wall Street" movement called on the authorities of New York when they tried to re-infiltrate, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another park of the Great Ya.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to break up the camp on the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the rush, capturing a park in the north of the city, where a long distance was held.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to break camp on the square, we will break camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle for the return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," - said one of the representatives of the movement "Ul-Zah.
Bree explained that the response of "angry people" to the evacuation of the tent town, which was personally ordered by the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg, came to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings left the demon debauchery and issued a ruling prohibiting the violent debauchery.
In addition, the "angry people" began to capture a new park, located at the junction of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Tholland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey.
At least an hour they could occupy the place, but then the police arrived and began to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not name the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization says several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for the members of the movement, trying to act as an intermediary in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zukotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning’s rush of protesters.
Some of the protesters who went there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time and even gave those copies to police guards guarding the square, which led to "some small-scale bizarre clashes," said Bray, who said some of them were not.
The court ruling prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the "Capture Wall Street" movement and forcing them to enforce "the laws that were issued after the start of the capture, or prohibiting demonstrators from re-accessing the park with shops and other property."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court ruling, the city suspended the opening of public space and the protesters were informed about it, but local laws do not allow them to reopen tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and a decision was made because the protesters "violating the law".
Bloomberg said he had ordered the area to be cleaned as it became "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses were threatened" and "neighbors were threatened".
The evacuation, which took place this morning, was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is deeply interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” a spokesperson for the movement said, condemning the mayor for “disrespect for freedom of speech.”
Those responsible for the Wall Street Captures also indicated that they intend to organize “great actions” on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to recall the last two months of the protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on Russell Peters's Christmas TV show on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "The Great Repair", a rescuer in "The Rescuers of Malibu", Banny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become a TV host in a special Christmas Eve.
The private CTV channel announced today that Anderson, along with the crowner (ballad performer) Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the television program "Christmas of Russell Peters" on December 1, as a very special Maria.
CTV today presented footage of the television show, in which Anderson, also known for a popular online home porn video, where she appears along with her then-husband, Jos<0xC3><0xBA>s, from the drummer of the band "Mötley Crüe", appeared.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian descent, who recently acted as the lead on Charlie Shin’s My Cruel Torpedo of Truth tour, appears as Joseph.
In tribute to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show CTV features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires to Argentine model Luisiana Lopilato and who also knows the twist in the scandals.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a “sucky” during one of his concerts in New York
Japan Resurrected After the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that has led to the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster suffered by the Land of the Rising Sun since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, material losses amounted to $300,000 million - a blow that, despite the severe world situation, seems to be taking place.
After three consecutive quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Registered in the second quarter, - for the Japanese the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The resurgence may be partly due to the resurgence of the purchase of machinery for the recovery of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% drop in capital expenditure, which was seen from January to March, the first drop after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen—or restructure—infrastructure, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure has increased by 1% due to the increase in the cost of cars, travel and rest.
Leymo yen
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the yen — the Japanese currency — became one of the “refugees” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the eurozone debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that pushes the company like a stone.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed the yen for its lows from July to September.
While markets continue to besiege the EU’s peripheral countries, the government of Esihiko Noda is not reducing vigilance.
We need to be aware of the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said economic policy minister Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of the participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts breakthroughs in the global economy, has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average, which is at 100 points, after it collapsed by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives the ground for doubt
Papadimos said the correction would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign a written commitment.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty emanating from parks, Greece continues to wander through the labyrinth that leads to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of Ella’s new transitional government is being imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister Lukas Papadimos warned yesterday that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed upon when he was appointed may not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the conservative party "New Democracy" will not be Antonis Samras.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions made at the October 26 summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debates, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase the employment of the population, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras’ message does not clarify any doubts about his position: “We are ready to help the transitional government, but we promise nothing.”
The Conservative leader took a step further in his sentiments regarding the EU and the IMF, the organizations that must freeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the treaty requirements.
But the European Commission, still feeling irritated by the effect of the Papandreou referendum in the style of all or nothing, yesterday reiterated that its demands are unequivocal: it will not be able to restart the impasse and helpless if the new government and the leaders of the main parties of Greece "does not agree".
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeo Altafai said the Troika inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of $8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet marked.
In the Greek club there are enough threads for a while longer.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized Spain's "main" place in relation to this type of finance
“Spain has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance.”
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades the country has become the second largest donor in terms of cooperation tools, the “essence” of which, she said, is that it is “a tool for people’s social progress, justice and hope for the best future.”
The Queen inaugurated yesterday’s Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the belief that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “absolutely necessary” to achieve the goals of the millennium in order to achieve the people’s goals set by the United Nations by 2015.
Spain is “still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all “responsibility”, says Don Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that have arisen during the summit of the best of these people, which will be possible for the best of the people, will “ensure the creation of new opportunities”.
There are “a lot of achievements” and “a lot of difficulties that we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to “two main goals”.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and one hundred million of these households will emerge from the poverty they are plunged into.
The impetus to the creation of the microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "has gone on a path started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as "an act of justice and recognition".
And she described the instrument's father as "a striking idealist in the universal cause of poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on the spot.
This experience took place a year later at the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings, such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen a continual development everywhere in the world," said Her Majesty, whose connection to this project has been brought to bear.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded the speech, inviting those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Trinidad and Tobago’s foreign minister, Himenes, said solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it was a “permanent commitment”.
Mr. Himenes concluded that microcredit is a “serious and solid course aimed at eradication of poverty” and that now “more than ever” governments in developed countries should work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to the people "to whom all the doors are closed", and the mayor of Valladolid, who is the patron saint of the two "Francisco Javier de la Riva, welcomed everyone.
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday in Leipzig was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but it was created in the autumn itself, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the government’s policy is far from being as strict as it should be today with respect to Greece and, perhaps, tomorrow with respect to Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, presented for discussion by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The ovations, which lasted a few minutes, which earned their speeches by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, Europhile and finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This may mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible to strengthen the European Union’s control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage “to give Europe a face”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals for the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
The soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each member of the European Union on the board of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Desiring to calm the situation in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Cole, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of “small” European countries or countries that are in a difficult situation.
Although in the draft resolution on Europe an entire paragraph is devoted to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing by.
Recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud with hospital sheets? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government began attacking the hospital sheets.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefits Fund and address the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against social welfare fraud.
And to help this attack, which arose out of a desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing re-election campaign, the majority wants to focus on hospital sheets.
First of all, with a view to saving the budget, the Government intends to impose on employees of private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of benefits begins.
Obviously, without the employer’s special consent, a sick worker will lose his salary for four days, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose on public servants one day without payment of the sickness benefit (public servants still did not have to wait for the payment of the benefit, as opposed to the three-day wait for work).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority also raises the issue of fraud again, with regard to the abuse of the issuance of hospital records.
Control will be tougher and additionally, if you are caught, you will have to return all payments you have illegally received,” Xavier Bertran told RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to actual abuses of hospital records.
They have been under constant control since 2002 and have been subjected to political attacks that bear fruit.
People in France are no more ill than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s look at the numbers in the first place.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, the daily compensatory costs in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 thousand million, accounting for 5% of the total health care costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were related to statutory leave and accidents in production and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 thousand million.
And, therefore, they accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenses.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic average, which hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they didn’t take a day out of the hospital.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, claims that in 2010, 37% of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days of one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
If you compare these figures to the figures of European neighbors, you can see that French workers are no more likely to take a hospital than workers in any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of unemployment in France (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, and 16-18% in the United Kingdom.
The level of fraud associated with hospital sheets is very low compared to the "grey" employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The toughening of the law after 2002 led to a systematic inspection of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of the 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term findings were “unjustified” or too long, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which is equivalent to 132,000.
In total, 169,000 cases were “unfounded” for the several million workers who received hospital sheets.
Figures that show very few cases in comparison, for example, with the figures of "grey" employment.
According to UMP MP Dominic Tian, the author of the report on the issue in June, they amount to 9 to 15 thousand million euros of under-received budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and, therefore, is infinitely small.
Papadimos: Greece should follow a new settlement plan <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
“Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said on Monday in parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to carry out the task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment,” the prime minister said in a statement, opening a debate on a vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the “primary task” of the new government, as the country’s presence in the Eurozone is “on the map,” he added.
Papadimos, respectively, forecasts a reduction of the country’s budget deficit “to about 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the measures of the new government
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt and combating waste, but also his disapproval of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olli Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finances, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million without written guarantees from all parties that it was not a matter of fact that they supported the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied.
Legalization of euthanasia and suicide with extraterrestrial assistance, says committee of experts
Canadians are denied death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
As far as palliative medicine is concerned, the Committee argues that the government, health institutes and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, regardless of cancer cases.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to resolve suicide with extraterrestrial assistance and euthanasia when that choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code with respect to euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid.
Now, according to experts, who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization involves abuse in the application, that is, that is, the decision that can be made by people or euthanasia or suicide not by external assistance.
On the contrary, confirmed during the teleconference by Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, the majority of such cases were in those countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not be a signal that the lives of older people or people with disabilities have less value.
As for people who have assisted in suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less unambiguous, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legally lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the late-life refusal of medical care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and physicians to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it is not used to curb physical pain, such as euthanasia, and subject to the same restrictions.
Remarks by other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Pierre Deshan, a specialist in health legislation, described the position of experts who signed the report as “extreme” because, among other things, it does not restrict the use of euthanasia to fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 can ask for help in committing suicide, says Meter Deshan, who discussed the report's summary yesterday.
Meter Desham also stressed that the authors of the report appear to place personality independence above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that “there are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expresses "categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges, in particular, the report’s findings concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Give Up Power
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is becoming more and more isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was heightened by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns a “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership of the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria's neighbours Turkey and Jordan voted for Assad's resignation.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to surrender power in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar had a dear interest in his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” the king of Jordan, the country’s neighbour to Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, were unsuccessful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, pointing to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh course.
The United States, for its part, welcomes the “expansion of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh course towards repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime’s armed forces were killed in the Dera region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reports.
Two other residents were killed in the shooting and a heavy machine gun fired at Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem said that the country is approaching the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the League of Arab States’ decision to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
“Syria will not be broken,” he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail.
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and demands that 500 members of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, journalists and military observers be brought to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alen Juppe also voiced support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he said fell into “paranoia.”
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for exiting the crisis, adopted on 2 November and providing, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where fighting is taking place, and the release of the arrested demons.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the decision of the League of Arab States “incorrect” yesterday, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to exit the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time for markets and victims from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and execute a program that will require “victims” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s reign.
The former European Commissioner took part in a discussion with political parties yesterday before today’s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, made up of technocrats who are not members of parliament.
Monti spoke about the importance of a program that involves many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Finni said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy needs time to prepare the government and the program,” he said, adding that he was confident that markets would be patient and understandable.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns resurfaced, particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians.”
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to House Speaker Ghanfranko Finni, the new government will get a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti assured that, once he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important figure in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Ren said: “Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.”
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not implement the planned budget for 2013, despite the stringent austerity plan adopted in recent months, has called for, in particular, new stringent measures.
Italian “boss boss” Emma Marchegalya, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth can’t meet the deficit parameters.”
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence in everyday life by the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "change of the era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", "professor", symbolizing the "challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", words.
The longevity of his team is unknown.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as by April 2012 Italy will have to make payments on government debts of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 million.
Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a U.S. agency specialized in the field of nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the UN agency to establish the identity of the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "starting in the 1960s, in the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds".
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to create a company that produces "nanomadas" in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company led him to contact with the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions "clear signs that Iran's development of the nuclear detonator system "contributed to the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well, but who also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology in the wars."
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI’s statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is an increase of 49%, compared with an increase of 13% in violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4% in the number of attacks against Jews and a total increase of 14%.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After the fall in 2009, the concern is that the number of these crimes is rising again, Human Rights First said, “the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant,” the organization added in an official statement.
“Human Rights First has long underlined that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights,” said Paul Leghandr, a leader of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to cope with these crimes, he adds, believing that this could be done by improving police reports of hate crimes.”
"Crimes on the basis of hate" in federal law are the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, nationality, and in our day sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, what makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new “activity” tab and another “name” allow you to more easily and directly track the activity of other “twitters”, Internet users whose messages (“twitters”) you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This allows you to see if they publish messages, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before being widely used across the network on Monday, AFP’s spokeswoman Caroline Penner said.
Twitter, which for a long time was known as intuitively rather incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to repost someone else’s obsession, <0x23>followfriday to recommend to follow other users more closely), will not be more closely followed by Google.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, obsessive, and very much like Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better follow certain elements of my Twitter feed, wrote <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria-Hungary
Implementation of the "golden rule" of the budget
The leadership of the large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budget “golden rule” into the constitution in order to reduce the Awtroyen’s budget deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of the resignation.
The Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faimann personally announced the decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian public debt being 74.6%, which is much higher than the upper threshold of the rate of Isfahan or Isfahan at 60%, as set by the Maastricht Treaty, than by the foreign state.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by just one point, from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay interest on three thousand million euros more each year, according to the argument of Vice Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Thus, Austria complies with the requirement of the Eurozone Summit on 26 October in Brussels; the Heads of State and Government have called for reductions in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decision, adopted by the Austrian government, resembles the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and since 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the land, like the communes, should represent the balance.
The goal is to make public debt fall below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
Threat of new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Esihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities will conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the value of the yen continues to rise.
We intervene, as we did last time, considering the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to the historical mark that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which set a new strength record since 1945.
But since then the yen has grown steadily, adapted by purchases of investors who perceive it as a “refugee” in these troubled times of the world’s economic downturn and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the latest intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the revenue volume of Japanese firms from abroad when converting to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to recover" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Mr. Noda stressed, who fears that this growth of the yen will kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The third-largest economic power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic indicators.”
Finance Minister Djinn Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy managing director of Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” and made it clear that no further mitigation should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand euros), raising to 55,000 thousand yen bouquets of rubles and financiers of yuan (519 thousand million euros), the ceiling of sums.
Eurozone
Wages are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of a debt crisis is undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in volatile countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European exchanges went into this Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10am CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at the level of 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
Due to the new difficulties in repaying loans to eurozone countries in a difficult situation, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Concerned investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7% under the burden of new doubts by market participants about Europe’s ability to withstand the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has augmented its view of Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsusige Akino, manager of the fund at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone hits a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party’s congress on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, in particular, an opportunity for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above 6%.
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level that raises serious concerns.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the stock exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which is under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "primary task" of his government.
Spain has been hit by markets in the run-up to the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The gap between interest rates on the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Expecting growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to the increased consumption of households.
Insee, however, revisited the decline in the second quarter, with a 0.1% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings are becoming a reason to reflect on the share and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options have been studied.
France must build its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now that we have 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to compensate for the growing shortage of fossil fuels in order to continue the production of electricity constantly, not forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat the climate imbalance - a theme that has disappeared from the ecological.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That’s why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case for Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its kit, resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on the Three Mile Island.
Although the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, aggravated by the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the rise of carbon dioxide emissions in connection with construction.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European champion in the construction of turbines, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas because of the intermittent wind; as a result of which the emissions of carbon dioxide and the price of electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than in the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy, the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they don’t object to this kind of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole host of specialized in international trade small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear energy, it would have to donate a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer will order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if it is planned to shut down its manufacturer?
In order to solve the equation of energy, it must be admitted that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security body that carries out uncompromising and transparent control of existing energy centers such as Flamenville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented power that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, represents a project that allows to resist such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy experts who want to build the reactor, stopping its construction in Flamenville will be a great gift to competitors Areva and EDF, clearing them the way to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and lawful to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in the dispute, which is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various sides - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services, the subordinated to the policy of figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "human rights state".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation of May 23) said that France "does not need foreign talents, stoneworkers and waiters."
But it is very rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The left and the right agree in this regard.
On the right hand side was given by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 stated that "900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left - Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from around the world."
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of the country by the Polish horde of plumbers was felt by both the left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on the French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limited himself to banalities, saying that “cooperation will solve our immigration problem.”
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As we are reminded by economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron in a recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, ed., University of Princeton, pp. 352.
Limiting immigration leads to weakening growth and reducing employment.
Fears of immigrants’ influence are based on the notion that they are capable of replacing local workers, especially low-skilled ones, provoking wage cuts.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than they are replacing the local labor force by performing jobs for which there is a shortage of local labor force.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most qualified ones are in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive Influence on Salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity existing between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Perry calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this is regardless of the fact that the diversity introduced by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among the US Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo – all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profits to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring in the state budget a net profit (income minus expenses) of an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, was going to get stuck in the missing growth points with his "tooths".
The aforementioned teeth, which were used to deter immigrants, gave the exact opposite effect.
Europe Invented Democracy, It Remains to Mean European Democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but at the same time fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the twentieth century it survived the tragedy of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to finally prevail over its enemies, it was enough to arrange a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the Younger, it is known that it comes from the surface of thought.
Although universal suffrage is a mandatory condition for democracy, it is not a sufficient condition and may even become an “instrument of repression,” as once-republican philosopher Etienne Vastro said.
No, democracy requires much more – public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, and justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first and foremost it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the true and false Greek referendum will have a double revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, in the opinion of many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will win nothing by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as necessary and in a chaotic order.
“Cart Blanche” for an absolute European monarch or a jump with tied feet into the abyss of nationalism – what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous implementation of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is unknown how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis – the crisis of Europe.
Europe as a whole is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgently necessary to restore the management of the European project to national sovereignty.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of everyone’s debt, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Exiting the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delors are all now demanding a European economic government.
Let it go.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has come into being ugly, is another madness and a new dullness.
We have to start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” the republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We need to build a Europe that is economically united.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real people’s European sovereignty.
In order to create Europe, let’s create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more.
The world chip-card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpent, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6,000 million units.
The most important sector of contactless technologies, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases, simply by holding a card over the reading device.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: there are 400,000 contactless Visa cards in circulation.
But big stores are growing at a faster pace.
This year, Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes.
To move to a higher speed, it is necessary for banks to supply their customers with equipment.
“The two major organisations in France have pledged to systematically distribute contact-free bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gerard Nebois, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to perform such transactions.
“They were postponed.
"But they're really going to have to disintegrate next year."
“We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
Banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment to be conducted from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone devices will be equipped with checks for approximately 200 customers and employees, which will provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch a market offering that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Expands from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
The long-awaited links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that the Algerians are now convinced of this.
"The way these two organizations use and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating," he said, without giving details.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January revealed two liaisons.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Lecourt and Vensan Delori were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
Here's the terror.
The analysis of the calls pointed to several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who has lived for a long time in Maidigur, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we definitely need to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortars and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abu Dhabi to pay attention to the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people of no interest.
Fast Succeed
Founded in Maydigur in 2002 at a mosque, a school and an imam-fundamentalist, Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which means “Western education is a sin” – preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict adherence to the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It is mainly aimed at the church, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed special activity by carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalized and will go beyond its northern ridges.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first attack of a murderer on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international objective.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now of concern to all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Allen Juppe warned about the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world as Republican presidential candidates see it <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
With regard to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Caine and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential nominees, voters would believe it.
For several days Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been crowding out loud but lacking details of the foreign policy statement, which has traditionally been a stronghold of Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of getting out of the “Old Good Party,” threatened to complain to the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive issue for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries into its industry.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, a former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate who understands complex foreign policy, has failed to overcome a position that flows from emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stands at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions could not stop its nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also pledged to intensify military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to the partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the nominee's rankings, demonstrated a disheartening ignorance of the case.
He recently called for China’s military threat to be countered because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and is seeking military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
To resort to the torture of suspects in terrorism banned by Obama in 2009, also recommend Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy foreign policy figure.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to reduce his tone in the fight against terror.
They are rightly insisting on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of “shoulders” from Iraq, his traps in Libya, which brought him the reputation of a weak politician.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population considers a positive balance of national security under Obama, who liquidated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that bind in the sand.
And, asserting that America needs to be economically rebuilt in order to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Stream, a new gateway to the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is expected to supply the equivalent of gas to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between an orchestral performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte have together turned a symbolic valve controlling the influx of Russian gas into Western Europe.
Under the new gas pipeline, an additional 27,500 million cubic meters of gas will enter Western Europe each year via the first 1,224 km long pipeline that connects the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total supply of 55 thousand million cubic meters of gas equivalent to all of France’s consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding the passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is striving for greater security of its supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already on the way.
“This pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it’s a new artery that organically connects us,” Fion said, opening the pipeline, demonstrating how important large gas contracts are both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom’s leaders, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields that remained since World War II.
“One hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesperson for North Stream.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel towers, without cracks along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers gave up on it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian state company would settle on its shores forever.
“In the event of an accident, we will shut down the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
So, in the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to the designers who designed seams designed to run only once every 100,000 years.
Control of the condition of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot, which pulls the ship, for external observation, as well as an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by the flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to work for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of the gas is carried out only by its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The others are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture, called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are located in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gasprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas is actually being transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez’s investment will be around 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay for their expenses, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The pipeline runs from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to the sandy coast, planted by coniferous trees.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the output terminal of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by the Italian company fifteen years ago, will return the taste to the letter.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent behind the letter at the light of the candle.
The Moleskine block is easily rectangular black cover, rubberized, yellowish-white pages, as if desired over time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to launch design notebooks for sale.
Maria Sebregondi, the company’s then-consultant, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The block is inspired by the old production technique, molasses - lacquered cotton fabric, used, for example, to cover the stones.
It is claimed that this type of notebook is highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought the old and forgotten thing into line with today’s taste, which was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the managing brand at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We went a long way from producing the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer, because the notebook attracts businessmen, students and freelancers alike.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centres of small towns and has been able to gain widespread fame.
“We followed the spirit of time and this new need for e-mail, despite the emergence of e-mail,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized an exhibition "Environmental Path", where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard drawing on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
Success that gave rise to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which put a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week of employment of disabled people begins today.
Despite the public charities policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is still twice as high as the average, 19% versus 9% for the general population.
Disheartening?
“No,” said Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for people with disabilities.
“In 15 years, we will make significant progress.”
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2, but 3 times higher.”
“But there is still a lot of work ahead.”
It must be said that there is still a lot to be done about disability barriers in employment.
Among them, 37% are older than 50 years old (17% on average).
They are more likely to have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree, and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and that are the essence of the problem,” says Christian Grapene, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association on behalf of Cité showed that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “presented themselves consistent people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally impaired.”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6% of disabled workers, set out in the law adopted in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 represent 2.6 per cent.
“Today we are about 3%,” says Pierre Blan, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxable" organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>606 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>480 million).
“The 2005 law, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on the company,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects the increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers versus 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday night (20.45 p.m.), Eden Azar and George Lakens did not hide the pleasure they had gained from this friendly.
We won’t go so far as to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the Stade de France arena, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his attacker's departure in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go further," Lilli said.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, it is one thing, - he is justified.
“I’m in Lille all year round and I’m not in Belgium.”
“I have to earn points.”
Left in reserve, ahead of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
Not to mention, however, the concept of “pleasure”.
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and won campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them,” he said.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially the fact that on the other side are Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“Our roads have just crossed.”
“To be able to play against them is pure happiness.”
Lekens remembered the “pride” kindly.
"Pride" to play in a "holiday match".
"Pride" also claims as a "neighbor" that France has "returned to a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Nice.
"Laran Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly in a blue-guided plane to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll make sure of that in future matches. Including this against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself.
Portugal’s Paulo Bento is starting his match against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost a sense of reality.
“By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paula Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and in Ukraine.
There is no doubt in his mind that the team, which he has been in charge of since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played, and Bosnia to be defeated.
With 0-0 on Friday in Hell Zenica it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, she was unable to achieve the promised goal that would calm her down.
“It’s a good result, which, however, carries a certain risk.”
But in his home, at his brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be held in front of an audience that should be thrilled, even though the match will be very tense," he told the optimist, but thoughtful B.
"We are looking forward to a very tense match, but we are confident that we can win," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of getting to Euro 2012,” said the successor of Carlos Keiros.
No one on Friday in a match against Bosnia demands a victory from the Portuguese.
No one could have arranged for the Bosnians.
“It’s a good result, but there’s some risk,” Bent said.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical merits and players that have a lot of individual merits," he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosniaks from the very beginning, "not give them time to think".
It’s a good idea if it’s realistic this time around.
