Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
On the Mass that he held, the Saints for liberation and healing draw the crowds.
He was a few years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the franchising, others are experiencing it.
On the Mass of St. Vitko on liberation and healing, the crowds are downloading
One day, the parents of a 7-month-old child, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart, came to him.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprising doctors said: “Operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents were crying out for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The extraordinary spiritual activities of the Creator began to be experienced already as a teenager.
In dreams, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
“I was awakened at night and forced to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment,” he recalls.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
“My body has started to change.
I lost my human traits and began to take on the appearance of an animal,” he says.
The invisible force lifted him up, he could not extract a voice from himself.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God gave him a saviour.
“Detached in the waters of the river symbolizing Holy Baptism, I was released and returned to the human form,” he says.
He didn’t tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a vocation in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit
Many people who are counting on getting rid of the disease participate in the Mass on the healing performed by Father Witko.
The clergyman stresses, however, that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
This afternoon (September 26th) Kolpinga FRAC team deserved the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd row of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
Jaros<0xC5><0x82>awian in such a personal setup as they presented with the peanuts, have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
It was a great match with Dart Bogoria.
The team is still missing, called to the team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the composition of the spring celebration would reach the third in a row of triumphs in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet grown up to win with such tugs as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, or Mark Badowski.
The contestant from Hellada was the biggest star of the duo in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class of their own.
After three singles, Kolping FRAC led 2–1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel G<0xC3><0xB3>rak after an exciting, five-year fight – Pavl Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
There was still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han did not face Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
- Why?
According to the announcements of Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski, a program of free prophylactic tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Classification.
In the statement, the agency explained that the target group was incorrectly selected.
“These actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulty in accessing NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing the anxiety and discomfort associated with a false-positive examination.”
The decision of the resort is not understood by the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are being examined, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is about leading to a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.
All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that the runners are saying, ‘Let’s not study, because there will be longer queues at the doctor’s office, and if such specialists advise the government, I’m not surprised that there is health care in that state,” he said.
Palestine Says to Israel: “We’re Breaking All Agreements So Far”
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced Thursday at the UN General Assembly session that he will break any agreements with Israel if the country's future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's promise of annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, as it will be, begins to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
"We will completely and completely abandon the whole plan," Abbas said in a statement.
“It is our duty to defend all of our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences will be – by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” the President of the Palestinian Authority said in a statement.
Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, has once again been given the task of forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the elections, he announced that if he wins, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements across the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then headed by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace treaties sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold general elections on Palestinian soil.
The last one took place in 2006.
“When I return to the country, I call for local elections in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and anyone who opposes them will have to be held accountable to God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech on the rights of Palestine, which he regarded as a permanent observer at the United Nations, the exercise of the powers of “full members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded the speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with full respect.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas’s speech, stating that the Palestinian leader “would rather focus in the UN on the Palestinian Authority’s efforts against Israel than to fight the calls for terrorism in the Autonomous Region under his command.”
However, Danon, as the agencies note, did not refer to the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.
Rescuers want defibrillators in neuralgic points of Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l
A history of border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
The Voivodeship Station of Emergency Preparedness in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l wants such devices to be located in the neuralgic points of the city.
For their attitude, the officials received congratulations from the Voivodeship Rescue Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek W<0xC3><0xB3>jcik are officials of the Sub-Carpathian Customs Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On August 28, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. The official of the Customs and Tax Service noticed a lying unconscious man in the pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the wife of the activist, was called on September 23 by a Communist Party secretary from her family village to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death, he did not reveal.
In Cao's mortuary, she saw the body of her husband massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in blood,” she said.
“They didn’t let me take my cell phone with me, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police have urged her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an “unfortunate accident.”
PLN 105 million for video game industry companies from the National Center for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the almost 30 projects that have been supported by the NCBR, there was the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows the user to send the data to the NCBR.
The objective of the sectoral program GameINN is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game manufacturers sector in the global market in 2023.
According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are a significant impetus for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” reads the statement.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
“Introduced by the government incentives for entrepreneurs who are investing in innovation, such as R&D grants, programs of excellence, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in the fields of innovation and cooperation with the Ministers of the Republic of Java”,
The head of the research centre points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted R&D costs amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in savings of more than PLN 300 million for companies benefiting from this reduction.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN," the vice-premier emphasizes.
The Director of NCBR, dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in the previous two funding tenders with a total value of more than PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the III competition and the variety of submissions show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly pleased that among the projects that have been launched – as in previous editions – there are projects on solutions that serve not only entertainment, but also industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to PLN 20 million, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific entities could apply.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of co-financing of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million of funding.
Detailed information about the results of the GameINN competition III can be found at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admits to stealing Kasper Dolberg watch
The event took place on 16 September.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice in late August, learned after training that his watch had disappeared from the wardrobe.
It’s not because it’s worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,000.
Angry Dane the next day did not show up at the classes, explaining his stomach problems.
From the beginning, it was a mystery.
The players in the wardrobe have private safes at their disposal, and the club grounds are monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he finally confessed to the theft Diaby-Fadiga.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Dane to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.
He arrived in Nice as a thirteen-year-old to make his debut in the first team three years later.
This season, he played in seven games.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as reported by the newspaper “L’Equipe” – the club is likely to resolve it with immediate effect.
For the time being, he has started a disciplinary action against his opponent.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that it is necessary to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of the bugs, you need to do it the right way.
This is especially important now that autumnal infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us wash them shorter!
It is enough warm water and ordinary soap – it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even rejuvenate them).
When washing, we rub not only the bottom and tops of the hand, but also: the tips of the fingers (connected or single) – rub them with colossal movements on the inside of the other hand, the space between the fingers (we rub your fingers with your fingers and your fingers on each other.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands) we should wipe your hands with a wet towel, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the hammer or the door with washed hands (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper towel.
Iran's President Says He Refuses to Talk to U.S. Donald Trump Refuses
Tehran has not taken talks with the U.S. side during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the Iranian side had asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the U.S. has proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and the ballistic missile construction program.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in an atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he did not agree to take these talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”
He said he met with U.S. diplomats because he had met with France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran will not take talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.
“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5<0x2B>1 format, no one is able to predict what the end result will be,” Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States, and European parties to the nuclear deal accused him of favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal “are a precondition that does not allow” the initiation of the dialogue.
“If we can withstand this precondition and if America can withstand sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation in the coming week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the request from the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course, I said "no!" tweeted the President of the United States.
Tension with the Atomic Agreement in the Background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to alleviate tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they were signatories to.
In exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran will abandon its nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector will be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, its other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.
So far, none of this has worked out.
Washington is using tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export raw materials, every 60 days it will limit its commitments resulting from the agreement.

The judge of the District Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hottie Emilia, who – according to her words and screens from WhatsApp – participated in the stalking against the judges, was restored to order by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no reason to support the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesperson at the NSA, initiated an explanatory proceeding against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not so far turned into a proceeding against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who spoke publicly about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in the heiter group, will return to the courthouse and will issue sentences on behalf of Polski Rzeczpos.
Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the Heather group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this other than the falsified screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.
Exactly the same is stated by the other judges associated with the "Cast": all are innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll bet on theirs.
Because the prosecutor’s office didn’t shake a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt’s phone, which she stopped in June in another case.
The police did not shake their finger to secure the devices of the people whom the persecutors indicated in the February report of Judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek.
There is no evidence – there is no case of Smydt, there is no case of “Kasty”.
There is also no case of NIK boss Mariana Banasia renting the house with suteners and concealing income.
The CBA checks his property statements.
And he'll check when he checks.
And the Commission of Business Ethics will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Commission of State Control has somehow gathered to make a curious decision to dismiss Banas’ alternates and appoint him as his lawyer, although the law of such a strange combination is inconsistent).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, I think, about how my wife comes home and stops her husband with her mistress in bed.
She's so stunned and devastated she can't say a word.
She is standing at the door naked, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, gets dressed and goes out.
And the husband's making the bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams, what is it?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?
Only the case of "Casty" or Banasia is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>winko in the final jump up
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after the mother’s break, the bronze medalist of the 2017 World Championships from London defeated 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
It was only in the third approach that it was able to achieve 1.94.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically,” Li<0xC4><0x87>winko admitted in front of the Eurosport camera.
The top scorers were American Vashti Cunningham and Belarusian Karyna Demidik, after 1.94.
The two players were the only ones who didn’t lose any weight.
The women's jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Cornel Morawiecki remains in hospital in severe condition
He got to the hospital, and the doctors described his condition as severe.
We must add that he is conscious and conscious.
“We think he’ll be able to win again.
We all pray that he will return to health,” said Kornel Morawiecki, an anonymous close friend, in an interview with reporters at Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the prime minister's father is running for the Senate.
“I’m kept alive by my closest family and politics,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to reporters at Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” reported that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw for research.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms, and I applied to the hospital.
Turns out I have jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the prime minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As told by Morawiecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, and I thank them so much.
Luckily, I don't have metastases.
I don't know if I'm going to undergo chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of doctors of specialists who are rather good thoughts.
For now, after this difficult operation, I have to go back to some state of usability.
I hope everything will be all right," Kornel Morawiecki said in January in a conversation with SE.
“If I was too late to undergo an investigation, it would be a tragic situation and I would say goodbye to this council,” he added.
Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w: 14-year-old missing

Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blond hair and brown eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, gray pants and shoes.

The power of the Olavian jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the racecourse at Oleandry Street in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, can be confusing for some.
The road to true power is far away, but this is what is called one of the types of horse competition...
The competition of jumping power consists in overcoming by riders and horses ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth to add that the long-standing and still undefeated world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the “Huaso” horse, is 247 cm.
No one jumped so high in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, of course, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm level is not one of the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS "In the saddle", were a demonstration part of the earlier "Riding Races", about which we write more in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons, who trained in riding in the Olavian JKS, participated in the competition.
Four competed on horseback, and four competed on big horses.
In the first group the best was Nikola Szoldra, reaching the crazy "Sprinter".
This small but dynamic rupture began with overcoming the obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with an upper beam 125 cm from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and it was only after three consecutive refusals that the jury of the competition was removed from further competition.
The second place in horse jumps was Amelia Pawlak, reaching "Famy", and the third Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> on "Harmiderze".
Ambitiously, the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on a small hill "Carmen".
Even greater emotions accompanied the start-up amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Threat-seeking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who reached the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the “Flight”.
Luckily, nothing bad happened to the Amazons or the horses, so they continued to take part in the competition.
Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz had a lot of problems with the introduction of the young winery "Wineta" into the park.
She needed either an assistant coach, or another horse for a pair, and a little crazy "Wineta" was behind her.
After counting the obstacles from the park, she also came down full of pride, so moments in the boxing and at the playground were dangerous. “Everything is under control!” reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little of the frightened spectators, especially the youngest.
Since the beginning of the competition for large horses, Marta Masalska was a great figure in the park, reaching the beautifully presented “whisky”.
This decent hammer, coupled with the experienced Amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase as the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result at the time of the races.
After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also counted the same height on the “Declaration”, Veronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz on the “Wine” and Anastasija Abramenko on the “Flight”.
To the decoration of the flop and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these athletes went out together, and in the end, together with the Amazons on the horses in the tact of the march of Radecki performed an effective round of honor, ending with it those interesting and exciting.

Max Kolonko cuts off from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW The Max Kolonko Patriotic Revolution is the name of the electoral committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonki’s <0x23>R Revolution political formation was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal, in particular, to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections Kolonko announced a cooperation with Mark Jakubiak, or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions came, and the KWW the Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself was not even able to collect enough signatures in the Pol<0xC4><0x99>b<0xC3><0xB3>r to put out enough signatures.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has terminated the cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
“I’ll expect the KWW to delete my name from my name.
I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the mentioned entity," he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether this is the end of the <0x23>R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on Independence Day, Mariusz Max Kolonko, a journalist living in the United States, announced the creation of a new political formation - <0x23>R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has been famous for hosting the YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to embrace the nation and rule for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said.
In the program of the parties there were, among other things, questions concerning the judiciary (should be elected in the general election), tax changes (comparation of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to the countries of the eastern flank of Poland, with special regard.
A few days after the announcement of the creation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile a message suggesting that <0x23>R will join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have come to fruition.
UBS: Gold near the equilibrium point
“The euro rate will remain around the PLN 4.35 threshold in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak economic climate in global markets,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“Expectations to maintain a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak for the stabilization of the gold notes on the current ceiling”, assesses the specialist in a conversation with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council does not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks mitigate policy.
“As much as the gold is properly valued – the euro notes should remain around the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months – the Polish bonds are so unattractive, he said.
Much more profitable profitability than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets,” said Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
“The global slowdown may still deepen, but there should not be a severe recession, and at the most, the decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.
“Investors should fail to demonstrate global actions that could be detrimental to the lack of prospects for a U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Europe should be the relatively weakest of the stock markets,” says a letter to investors from UBS Wealth Management CEO Mark Haefele.
“Actions from eurozone countries should behave worse than those from the U.S. because they are more susceptible in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowing down,” the document said.
According to Michael Bolliger, after a hossa in the bonds markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of the German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the fall in profitability.
In the longer term, however, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, by mitigating the monetary policy of banks.
The Fed’s biggest field of interest rate cuts is expected to lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency over the next few years.
The long-term point of equilibrium for euro notes is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed’s rate, which will result in a reduction in the disparities in the world’s monetary policy.
“In order to maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term, they may not allow the current account and budget deficits,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapon.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has reported the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition pieces, according to a confidential statement made in the RFN defence resort.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the media group Redaktionsnetz Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office of the Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weapon and 3,474 ammunition have been re-targeted so far.
Military equipment, which is still missing, includes six universal machine guns MG3, 11 automatic guns G3, four automatic guns G36, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, there is a shortage of 30 luf for the MG3 machine guns.
The situation was expressed by the vice-president of the Left party, Martin Renner.
As she told reporters of the RND, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “distorting.”
All the more so, as a result of the investigations carried out, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “financial balance sheet”.
She also criticised the fact that the report does not indicate whether there is a weapon found there during the investigation against the Bundeswehr lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a slur for a serious act of intimidating violence and threatening security.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on the leading German politicians from far-right and racist motives.
His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included then-minister of justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Greens and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally entered the possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosive charges.
Crying children on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
The carrier Japan Airlines has recently used a feature designed for people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the layout of the seats on the plane.
If a minor travels to the second year of age, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the possibility to choose a place far from that occupied by the child.
The BBC says the lines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.
The “Child Icon” will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the plane has been changed at the last minute.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
These are children, and we used to be them.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we will need a map of seating for mouth breathing, salivating or drinking,” wrote user G Sundar.
Another of the internet users noticed that he was once disturbed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me against screaming children during a 13-hour journey,” Ahmed said in a statement.
Majorca counts losses after Thomas Cook’s travel agency bankruptcy
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive in October for a holiday to Majorca as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.
As the representative of the autonomous government of Balearic Islands Marc Pons reported on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Neocker.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, as Pons argues, because Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses to the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on “entry into the Majorca market” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 employees are laid off at Thomas Cook’s Palm Office.
The rest of the people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many hotels in Majorca, property owners demanded that guests pay an extra fee for the night.
This situation was experienced by dozens of tourists from Poland, among others.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had suspended operations at least until the end of October due to the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook and his cooperating companies.
On Friday, the Diario de Ibiza newspaper reported that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which have collaborated with the Thomas Cook group, do not intend to close their facilities in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, a British bankrupt co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to cover losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most injured on this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is charging local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, about 5 million euros for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.
Women's FIFA rankings.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the top
The women’s national team of Poland is ranked 29th in the ranking published on Friday by the International Football Federation (FIFA).
At the same position, coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski's team was classified in the previous July ranking.
Weak squad matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders were the American women who recently defended the title of World Champions.
The second place in the ranking was held by Germany, and the third place was held by the Dutch.
Poles are preparing for ME qualifications.
They were scheduled to start their departure match with Czech Republic on September 3.
The day before the meeting it was – due to food poisoning of the opponents – exceeded by a year.
In this situation, the Poles will open their qualifications with a meeting with the Spaniards on 12 November in Lublin.
Previously, "Bia<0xC5><0x82>o-Red" will play two social matches – on 3 October on the departure with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
The Polish rivals are represented by Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from second place are promoted directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from second place will play in the barracks by the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
The men's national team of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog depressed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are scarce, and the coal ovens will be hovering this winter as if nothing were ever done,” reads the first page of today’s Rzeczpospolita.
“To date, 82 thousand applications for funding totalling PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The accepted applications are based on a total amount of more than PLN 915 million," says Rz, referring to data from the spokesman of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper notes, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the program.
The results of the rumored program are rated as "moderate".
The self-governors, cited by "Rz", are imbuing the failures of "Clean Air", among others, in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic filing, sending invoices by post, and possible excise verification of implementation.
This would improve the actions", says Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski, mayor of Lidzbarka Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm also note that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the proposed goal of exchanging 3 million smog boilers was achieved.
As “Rz” notes, although the budget of the program is 103 billion PLN for 10 years, or 10 billion PLN per year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and the Water Economy for this year, PLN 1.4 billion was reserved for the rapture", we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Now Price Negotiations
The U.S. Congress has agreed to sell to Poland 32 of the most modern F-35 aircraft.
“This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work,” B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price,” the Polish minister added.
Contract for the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department expressed its consent to their sale to Poland.
The statement stressed that the investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter jet.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics support and program and personnel training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a single-seat and single-engine fifth-generation multi-purpose fighter.
The aircraft is able to carry out missions of close support, bombing and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable to near-range radars.
The F-35 recently purchased Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering purchasing U.S. fighter jets.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
This is how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie Producer Launches Gender Neutral Dolls Series
In addition to Barbie with different skin colours, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the series "Creable World" wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys with girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different leather colours and with different clothing.
They also gave up emphasizing the characteristics of gender – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and a thin waist or – in the case of Ken – wide shoulders.
The company believes that children don’t like when their dolls have imposed gender norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will allow all children to feel free,” says Mattel.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in swimsuits and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes,” such as unnatural body proportions.
The Group has responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: Round or club Together can have dozens of members
Zandberg asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the lists of leftist groups (KW SLD from which the candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together start, starting with the common logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the result.
“I believe that the outcome of the Left will be very good because we feel that people have the hope that the Left is no longer only right, but also has the strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 members.
“This could mean that the club or the club together will have dozens of members.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
“I’m not going to guess and tell you how it will happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left Together will have a separate wheel, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles because we showed that by differing, we were able to agree on a common program.”
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint startup is SLD leader W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
Considering that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he said that “the goal of the political party is to represent its voters”.
Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
In the case of the Senate elections, he said he was thinking.
“The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further,” he said.
“I will tell you very honestly and clearly that if I were in District 44 of the Senate, I would take an electoral certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I wouldn’t try to cast a vote on Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (CO-PAP candidate),” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa has been opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of the huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by buses, cars and on foot in the Bopp district, where a new mosque, which can accommodate 30,000 believers, stood.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, belonging to the Sufi sect of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, handed over by the government.
The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("The Path to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, worshipped by followers as a saint.
The mosque is lined with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest of them is 78 meters.
The mosque in the center houses 15,000 believers, and the second one can be on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gold-plated dome, gigantic chandeliers and handmade decorations by the Moroccan workers.
Builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the gmash is still not comparable to the mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 believers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed from private donations.
In addition to the land, the government funded lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road works worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.5 million.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, but we ourselves
After eight league matches without a win, the Korona players will try to break in Friday’s meeting with Silesian extra-class vice-leader.
“Our problem is not Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw, but we ourselves, we have to work on what we are playing,” said coach Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a.
The Korona players last and so far the only victory in the league was in the first row, when they defeated 1:0 benjaminka Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa matches on the way out.
Later, they scored two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with Zad<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I’m optimistic that in the last few seconds of the cup game, the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to relegate.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle was not a result of the collapse, it was just a fall of anger, because they were so close," Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why the team will be sensitive to play in the side sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In Friday’s match in Corona, Ognjen Gnjatic will certainly not play a pause over the yellow cards, there will also be a shortage of injured Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
The building, however, is to register in the cup match of several players with the will of the game.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed like it won’t be, and now it is,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
Crown Defender Daniel Dzivniel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the path of eight league matches in a row without a victory, while in the extra-class everyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
“In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the pitch, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday.”
After nine queues, the five-point extra-Class Crown ranks 15th.
Silesia collected 12 more and placed in second place.
The Friday match in Kielce will start at 20.30.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
“42 percent of all tree species in Europe are endangered,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among other things, chestnuts and jam.
The IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was compiled by experts who, based on the research, concluded that 42% of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world) are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes of the Red Book is the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As far as typical European tree species are concerned, according to IUCN experts, 58 percent of species are at risk and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanization, over-intensive tree cutting, and further forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosquitoes and porpoises is also highly endangered.
“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual extinction of European plant species and create the danger of extinction in Europe of important and underappreciated varieties, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” said Luc Bass.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600<0x2B>
“Today PiS wants to buy back Poles, offering them for freedom distribution on a loan that will have to repay future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
In his opinion, “the whole policy of PiS is a pic.”
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away.”
In an interview with Jack Nizinkiewicz, Schetyna says she has an idea for defeating Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than the Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski party.
“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has opposed the values of modesty, humility, transparency,” Schetyna said.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the president of the Civic Platform also noted the basic assumptions of the electoral program of the KO.
“First of all, nothing will be collected, but it is necessary to indicate the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “depleting the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that in the KO program, among other things, there was a project that will give the least profitable Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners – also after several hundred.
The politician also noted that he did not want to compete for the distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he does not promise 600<0x2B>.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition to the distribution until the financial collapse of the country has finally occurred,” he said.
Schetyna also stated in an interview for Rz that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidava-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would abuse their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
“Peace walks before a fall.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski is a man of state like Banas is a crystal," he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether to apply for the platform’s chairmanship.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors of the Great
Six large condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic dumpster.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It’s a big loss to the environment because a condor needs to be 10-15 years old in order to become fertile and capable of breeding.
So we lose the protected species, the endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic baits and poisons puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
RZ: They want jewels for the president
Work has begun on awarding the Head of State a precious chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda’s office – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, it is a gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insygnium officially called the interwar jewel of the Republic.
The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
“Rz” says that soon such a chain could hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday on a proposal to undertake work on the reform of the law on orders and awards in order to restore it.
The newspaper says this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it passed by one vote.
This time, the work is instantaneous.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, acknowledging that they would reach the opinion of the President’s Office.
This one came in mid-September.
“I kindly inform that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in the petition in question,” the then Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera wrote.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The chancellery of the President answered us briefly: it is in favour of restoring it,” said committee chief Robert Mamatow of PiS, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection
The police action will be conducted at the intersection of al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski with al. Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski.
The actions of the uniforms are somewhat related to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to properly behave at the crossroads.
On Friday, September 27, policemen will begin preventive actions "Transient crossings" in Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w.
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering at the intersection without the possibility of exiting, not applying to light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and we really make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, vice-president of the city.
His words echoed at a press conference of the city hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars after intersections, which in effect creates corks.
At the time, the president appealed to travelers to make sense on the road and, among other things, to speed up moving on the lights or not writing SMS while driving.
The theme was somewhat taken over by the Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w policemen, who from today start the action “Transient crossings”.
What's going on?
The aim of the actions is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting the mobility at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
This is a frequent violation that contributes to the strengthening of obstacles in movement and the formation of clogs.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.
In addition, the uniform will pay attention to not being used for light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of driving, late movement of the signallers, free crossings and leaving too long distances between the vehicles.
At what crossroads will action be taken?
Among other things, on Lisa-Kuli from Jagiellonianska street; al. Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski street; Targowa from Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski street; <0xC5><0x9A>reniawit<0xC3><0xB3>w Square from D<0xC4><0x85>browski street or Hetman<0xC5><0x84>ska street from Warsaw street.
This type of action in the capital Podkarpacia will be held on the following Friday of October.
They inspected a company that disinfects waste from “Chajki”
“Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Municipality of Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski County and the Provincial Inspection of Building Control have on Friday inspected the facility in the municipality of Zielonka, where the waste from the wastewater treatment plant “Czajka” in Warsaw is disposed of.
Inspectors from the Volomian mayoralty carried out an inspection at a plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Commercial and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under the agreement with the capital wastewater treatment plant "Czajka" provides waste management services.
“Inspections of the installation were carried out, in addition, the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to the activity carried out by him,” Szyszko said.
He added that the sub-control report will be transmitted, among other things, to the Regional Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in “Dar-Trans” was carried out by the Wojevodzki Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw between December 29, 2015 and February 11, 2016.
It was then determined that the company did not carry out sampling, measurements and groundwater tests, and also did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage deposits from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka".
After the control of the WIOS, Dariusz Sobota was called to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
“DAR-TRANS” Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage treatment plants from the “Czajka” sewage treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal on the site, waste up to 60,000 tonnes per year are processed in the forests around Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sanitation Company reported on Thursday that at the end of November and December 2018, the STUDIO was shut down, which was related to the damage of one of the combustion plants.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidaw<0xC4><0x99>-B<0xC5><0x82><0xC5><0x84>ska.
“You have been given a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82><0xC5><0x84><0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
"Mr. President, for me these are very important words," the candidate of the Coalition of Citizens answered to the Prime Minister, the leader of the list of KO in Warsaw.
The former president emphasized that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now “only a fan on retirement”.
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa at his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk on Friday.
A short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa’s son, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
“You have done a difficult task,” Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems before Poland are known to all of us.
That is why there is great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible,” the former president said, addressing Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked you for your support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and know how important it is,” she said.
“Let’s show that you can make a different, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to the respect for others.
This is how you made your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said.
Kibic on retirement
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said in an interview with reporters that he is now “only a retired fan.”
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, (to that end) we will return.
The trinity of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And that's all we need to clean up, that's all we need to get back to normal, and I believe we'll do it this time.
Because if not, then the street criterion awaits us,” said Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa.
“That’s why it’s so important for Poles to go to the elections, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing," Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska added.
“The last chance that we will improve the state of things that is in Poland with a card,” the former president replied.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “The president said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no trinity of power, since the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and let everyone know that Poland will not move a step forward otherwise.
Slovenia – Poland 3-1 in the semi-final.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish netmen competed with the Slovenes in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The White-Reds lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has decided on key laws.
The Senate passed without amendments the law on the disclosure of the family assets of the most important civil servants and on the flights of the most important persons in the country.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the law on the property of families of state officials – without amendments – and 14 voted against, three abstaining.
Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments submitted during the Wednesday debate by Senator S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments had the law to “civilize” and to limit the scope of the information provided in the declaration on the estate situation of own children, children of the spouse, children assigned to cases where children remain in a joint household with a person obliged to.
The law on the transparency of the property of the families of the most important civil servants, the project of which was created in the office of the Prime Minister, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The provisions assume that, among others, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Chief Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons who are at the head of the joint informants of other state institutions, will be obliged to inform the persons and the persons who have the right to file a petition.
The Senate has also not proposed amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important people in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
55 senators voted for the bill, 12 opposed it, and four abstained from the vote.
According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight “made in official mission”.
The President’s flights will be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be the flight “acquired to carry out tasks directly related to the function performed”.
The law also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
According to the rules, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft – invited members, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational assistance; and journalists.
In accordance with the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not resolved within the specified time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm’s office or the Senate of the inability to organise such a flight.
A new representative from the sport
Waldemar Paluch appointed his representative in the field of physical culture, sports and tourism.
He became Artur <0xC5><0x9A>wi<0xC4><0x99>tek, long-time president of the University Club AZS PWSTE Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw, for the last 4 years the director of the Office of the Rector of the Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw University.
Bart<0xC5><0x82>omiej Pacek Artur <0xC5><0x9A>wi<0xC4><0x99>tek was recently heavily involved in the basketball reactivation project in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Artur <0xC5><0x9A>wiattek is not an anonymous figure in the sports environment of Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Graduate of the Academy of Physical Education in Bia<0xC5><0x82>a Podlaska since 2002 is an instructor at the State Higher School of Technical and Economics in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw, and has been president for 15 years.
After the first training in Paris, the Poles are waiting for the last rival
The Polish goalkeepers held their first training on Friday in Paris, where they will play in a match with a bronze medal on Saturday.
Vitala Heynen's path to the title was closed by Thursday's 1:3 defeat with the Slovenians in Ljubljana.
There was a lot of talk about their problems with the trip to this duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday afternoon they went with the Slovenian charter to Paris, and a few hours later they held training in the famous Berca hall.
According to reports of people present at the classes, the trainer of the world champions was under-nerved.
As the assistant of Heynen Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of the networking elements themselves.
“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We have been brutally brought to earth.
Without two sentences, we are disappointed.
We always thought we’d be back in this game.
We discussed this match with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point out ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than usual coping with situational balls.
In this respect, the Slovenes were much better than us," he analyzed.
According to him, “White-Red” did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the tournament’s co-hosts supported by a loud and numerous audience.
He admitted that the world champions could sleep a little on the smooth way to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group stage, we would have looked at that lesson more quickly and later on we would have played in the next phase of the tournament.
But it's just a bath," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday’s defeat of the Poles will turn into aggression in the match for bronze.
“I hope that we will show you our true face.
There's something to fight for.
The last time we won the medal was in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group stage they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: a severe punishment, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player has been given a 16-week ban on starting and a $25,000 fine – in a six-month suspension – for obnoxious words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour staff lose their patience for Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the crimes of the most unscrupulous professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks of breaks plus a heavy fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which the crippling athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working for a long time and has made his own tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for violating the rules of conduct on the court and next to him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, non-sports behavior, insulting the judge and the spectators, breaking two missiles during a losing game with Karen Chaczanov – all for that after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113,000.
At the 2019 US Open, he also did not play for long, but he managed to say publicly that ATP activists are “corrupt”, which hurt the authorities of the organization so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and a few weeks later handed down the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of the start-ups.
However, his words about corruption were forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
In the statement, however, tennis activists said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behavior over the past 12 months has in many cases raised serious reservations and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules that he repeatedly violated the rules of playing and the vulgarity of the person involved in the tournament.
However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment, ordering to meet in the next six months a number of conditions: in the tournaments ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios, he can not in any way violate these rules.
He also received a recommendation to seek “continuous support” from mental coaches during tournaments and also consult with people specializing in solving problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.
The first comment (on social media) by Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as in the Lavera Cup, his hip injury has exacerbated, so he had to give up the nearest starts in Beijing (September 30 – October 6) and Shanghai (October 6 – 13).
In ATP Kyrgios ranks 27th.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
A report published on Friday by the GUS on household budgets shows that as good or rather good their material situation was assessed by up to 44% of them.
The previous year this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of people working on their own account.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.
On the other hand, the households of renowners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a great influence on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst thing is known to parents alone raising offspring, of whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, and among homeless households it is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500<0x2B> programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by single-bred parents and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, especially from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households at the voivodship level.
The best assessments are formulated by the inhabitants of the Voivodeship of Opole, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are also Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Masovian (47.3%) and Western Pomeranian (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opole the regulatory income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average, and in Lubuskie 98%.
The inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesian (104 per cent) had the highest incomes.
On average in Poland, the statutory income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after the adjustment to the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of the previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While revenue growth slows down, it also slows spending growth.
These per capita amounted to PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, spending per person increased by 1.9%, and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its regulatory revenues, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

U.S.: Three suicides among crew members
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of the ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three of the sailors shot themselves last week.
Each incident took place on land when the USS George H. W. Bush crawled off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the involvement of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, deaths are not to be linked.
“We need everyone to be involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent the next suicide.
“I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions related to seeking help,” Sean Bailey, the ship’s captain, wrote on Facebook.
Nesio<0xC5><0x82>owski is critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszyck, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, every sentence was accepted.”
There was later criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activities of Rydzyk is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – has developed his media into the best yet in the life of the Polish pope,” he said.
The ex-Politician PO admitted: “There were a lot of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and for his politicism he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fid.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as did his successors,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski explained.
“Beyond this came this fatal issue of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, and actually their lack.
I thought a little bit ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We know about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these atrocities,” says Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski in an interview with a journalist.
According to the former PO policy, the Polish Church is an ally of the PiS.
“We must admit that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, the crosses were hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of the dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will come to pay salt,” Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski said.
“I hope that Pope Francis will chase J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type,” he said.

PZPN swarms for burglars in stadiums.
Grip disqualified
The start in the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk with small hair did not end tragically, when the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, was fired by fans from Wejherowa by the millimeters.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
Investigating the case, the PZPN committee imposed severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed in the nearest match to their own stadium.
They will also not be able to leave groups for league matches until December 31.
The burdas at Widzew <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> Stadium also sparked fans of Silesia Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Here, however, the judgment of the PZPN was milder, because Silesia had warned that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities in this matter.
Nevertheless, the services have allowed to throw the <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> fan sector with crabs, set fire to the chairs and forcing the host sector.
The match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water tank.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The ban also included the Ekstraklasy league matches, but there it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to replace the labelling across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKIA Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w
In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the reform of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the registration of the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, "Lion" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our voivodeship, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, more readable and easier.
The new guidelines are the result of the revision of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signs and road safety equipment.
“We should remember that the names of the villages in neighbouring countries often have Polish meanings as well.
Thanks to the change in law that we have prepared, they will finally appear on the road signs along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking will start from the sub-Carpathian section of the A4 motorway,” said Andrzej Adamczyk, Minister of Infrastructure.
In Podkarpacija, changes will be made on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of investment?
200,000 PLN
First of all, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled for November 1, 2019.
What does the realization of the idea look like?
It will run without replacing the boards, basically the stickers.
They will replace the existing names of the towns with new names written in Polish on the existing characters.
Both names will be written in a single line – first in Polish, then in the original, in naw<0xC4><0x99><0xC5><0x9B>ia.
This will be a great facility for those who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone fired a snail from a windmill
In the pond in Zameczny in Lower Silesia, residents noticed a slug with problems with wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set up a target with the animal – a screw from the windshield was found in his body.
“Information about the wounded bird was received from the villagers of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center in Nova Soli.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately apparent that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to hurt him or put him under any additional stress.
The lobster was caught and suspended to the veterinarian.
After the first photo of RTG, it was already known that someone had made a sniper shield from it.
There were fragments of screw in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation center, among others.
It's cold in the center
"Wounds were cleaned, antibiotics were given to the bird, access to water was provided, a safe place in the center where he will spend the entire winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
At the moment, he's not able to fly.
If he were to be released now, he would probably not survive the winter," Walasek adds.
The staff after undergoing the rehabilitation crutch intends to release him in the spring to the same pond.
The authorities of the municipality of <0xC5><0xBB>ukowice after receiving information about the cause of the animal’s poor state of health intend to inform the prosecutor’s office about the case.
The event took place in Zameczno
Gowin: “We must encourage Polish, retail trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the agreement Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin.
Gowin, during a conversation in Signals of the Day, stated that trade is controlled by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Given that it was very difficult to combat this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received “contrary from the EC”.
“We have voted in front of the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the upcoming elections and formulates a government, we will return to that issue,” he said.
At the same time, he noted that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e., small-scale trade”.
“On this one will need to consider whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax is an inadmissible public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act envisaged the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% of revenues between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% of revenues above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to apply from September 2016 onwards.
In September 2016, the European Commission initiated proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.
At the time, Brussels argued that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
It further stated that the data was put into effect in a way that was incompatible with the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until the end of its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May ruling by the EU Court of Justice paved the way for a re-imposition of the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission brought an appeal to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TSEU press services informed the PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and any discussion, will be initiated.
It takes a good few to a dozen months from the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“This procedure lasts an average of one year,” a PAP source told the Court in Luxembourg.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer a number of practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first time that the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating together his appearance in the world.
So it’s no wonder that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on that day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child’s outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In the shops you can find many machine kits, which do not provide the baby with adequate comfort.
What, then, should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion of choosing a dress for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, several weeks of babies were baptized, arranged in white sets and inserted into the same slugs or large slugs.
Today, children who enter the sacrament are often older: several months old, one year old, and even older.
It is not hard to guess that such a great comfort needs a little bit of a different dress for baptism.
Therefore, if your child will be 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, they will probably spend the celebration in a trolley or at the hands of their parents or baptized.
The best way out will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton dormitories or kits.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a daily outfit, it is enough to look for its sacred variants, for example, with a velvet or crown.
For the boy, it will be perfect for mosquito and skeleton prints.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have more imagination in clothing.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, velvet dress
Many parents of girls look sadly towards the richly decorated, velvety christening dresses in a set of coats, straps and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathing materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right outfit, you will better look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, bodice skirts, satin dresses, skirts, appliances and charming sets will make your daughter look gorgeous and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the parents of the boys, there was fashion for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester navy and trousers, rigid collars or cassettes often made young elegances louder demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they have been worn by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft sweatpants, and in addition the blouse decorated from the front in the pattern of the vest.
These machines look extremely sacred, and at the same time do not curl up the movements of the little one who knows the world.
Krystyna Pavlovic published a statement of property
Krystyna Pawlowicz filed a statement of assets at the end of the term.
It follows that the MP of PiS collected PLN 110,000 in savings.
Let’s remember that Pavlovic announced his resignation from politics.
At the end of his term, he has 110,000 PLN.
According to the statement made by the envoy, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4,7 thousand.
Paw<0xC5><0x82>owicz has an apartment with a value of PLN 570,000 and a little smaller, which he rents, charging PLN 880 per month.
The MP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, the property declaration was also published by Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
Vote on the break in the proceedings at the time of the Conference of the Conservative Party
British lawmakers voted against a three-day hiatus in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party’s annual programme conference, which was requested by the government.
There were 289 members, 306 against.
Typically, the House of Commons does not hold party conferences, so that Members do not have to resign either from their participation or from parliamentary meetings.
Opposition parties, however, felt that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before Britain’s planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the request of the government, 289 MPs spoke for a break, with 306 against.
Two opposition parties after the conventions
The absence of a pause can be seen as a political retaliation of the opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (the decision was deemed by the Supreme Court on Tuesday to be inconsistent with the law and illegal) and for his failure to rule on it.
Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson’s speech and the subsequent tumultuous debate.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time to get Brexit done.
We need to implement it in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come in order for us to deal with a deal on citizens’ priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit must be realised so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to begin in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday, October 2nd.
Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave in explaining such a lengthy suspension of parliament was the party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media wrote.
The President’s spokesman resolutely rejected these reports.
“It’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, referring to the “Jewish Insider”, write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with Jewish diaspora representatives at the RP consulate in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that “Polish people have expelled anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements made by its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, “Poland, Pole.”
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
That’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel is responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
According to the Spychalski portal, “he invented it.”
According to “JI” interlocutors during the meeting, there was also a dispute between Holocaust survivors, awarded the Commander-in-Chief of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland by Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Botech.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda’s words and say that it is Israeli Jews “like Israel Kac” who are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources on the portal Boteach, Mosberg's statement was to be interrupted.
Who is Bana<0xC5><0x9B> and what did he blame?
Rented by suteners, the house led the journalist to discover the negligence in the property statements of Marian Banas.
Let's sum up the next issue that shook the governing camp.
Journalists “Supervisjera” TVN revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, in recent years has not entered into the statement of ownership of a 400-metre building, which is located on the Podg<0xC3><0xB3>rza in Krakow.
What’s more, his landlord had to run a sex business in the aforementioned building (and therefore rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has been said to be a guarantee of repayment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel made reference to the irregularities in the program "Supervisor".
The journalist revealed that Banasia had rented the mansion from people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place for “erotic encounters.”
The clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> responded vaguely and mutely to the accusations.
Interestingly, the cottage rented by the Suteners led the journalist to discover the negligence in Banasia's property statements.
The house itself was described indistinctly in them, and the income from its rent was to be lowered.
“The assets of Mariana Banas and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast two houses, three apartments, savings [...]”, writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia house itself was already worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently in control of Mariana Banasia’s property claims for the years 2015-2019.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK until its completion. "I will join your marshal for free leave", he assured.
The opposition is asking for clarification.
“We do not hear that the CBA has extended its investigation or accelerated the investigation of Marian Banas’ estate claims.
That is why we are forced to expel the state authorities and to submit a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said MP for PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole were so appallingly low in renting his property, he would already have 10 checks, tax intentions and criminal-tax procedures,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new president of the Supreme Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a six-year term.
His candidacy was submitted by Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were adopted.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK from 1992-2005., he worked in this institution as a collaborator Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banas held the position of President of the Customs Service, and also Deputy Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he has again sat on the chair of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Tax Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0xA1> served as Finance Minister under the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a policeman's order will be punished
According to the newspaper, the negligence of an order of specific conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The policymakers want to make such a change.
The idea came to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million criminal cases are filed in Polish courts,” we read.
“Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition that the Independent Union of Police Officers writes to the members on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners are proposing a new version of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
“Whoever does not submit himself to the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, shall be subject to a penalty of arrest, a fine or a restriction of liberty.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of the same punishment for those who, without following orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of a professional activity,” the newspaper said.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said “Rzeczpospolita”, that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it could be used in the affairs of political demonstrations.
“In situations of libertarian demonstrations, it would be unfavorable and, instead of alleviating the situation, it would even exacerbate it,” he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that each month the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Bura is worried about Europe
J<0xC3><0xA1>chym Topol's writing is in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed in the same line with V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, the curse of the talent that he is trying to use was hanging over J<0xC3><0xA1>chym.
After eight years, he returned with a "sensitive man".
The heroes are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a along with their two sons, but they do not form a typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, they're traveling around Europe.
He's a Shakespearean lover and a thief, she's a one-eyed interpreter who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound of himself, and for the second time he stopped in the time of infancy.
But the heroes are not the most important in this story.
All of them are just the backdrop for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It is a world of infested provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and dissolved youth.
"The Sensitive Man" in places turns into an absurd theater.
The narrative imitates the didascals, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is Europe full of fears about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy
Although British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian branch Neckermann operates.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but the evenings will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Today, about 12,000 Belgians live abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is currently "fully operational" despite the announcement of a bankruptcy by the British company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then reassured that customers who bought out tours in it, will go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the world’s largest travel agencies, announced bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of the last chance conversations with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
Creditors demanded that, in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900m bailout plan agreed in August, the company earn an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200m as collateral for the winter period when travel agencies typically have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have increased for several years, resulting in a debt of <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

“I don’t think Slovenia played fantastically.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
Actions are intended to help fight the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city of Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
According to The Guardian, however, the city is struggling with significant problems.
In Görlitz, there are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a permanent loss of population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city’s population.
In 2013, it numbered 54,000 people.
In order to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.
Two-thirds of them were built by the inhabitants of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.
“When we applied, we thought the program was going to convince people to move to Görlitz,” one of the project participants said.
“Now we feel that it doesn’t matter whether we’re going to be here in four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant dwellings, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move on permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from the program participants.
The information collected from the interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to relocate, what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, who is responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas for attracting new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first of these was Detroit, which introduced a pay program promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in American Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma.
