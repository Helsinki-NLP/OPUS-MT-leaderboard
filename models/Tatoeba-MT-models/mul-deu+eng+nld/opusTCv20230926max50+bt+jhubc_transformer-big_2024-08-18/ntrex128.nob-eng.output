Welsh MPs don't want to appear as "muppets"
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour Party representative explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means "dusty", and pwp means "box".
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP's pronouncement is very close to the word "Muppet", which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the final right of determination as to which name they should be referred to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing general support for the renaming of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
Representatives are reportedly proposing other alternatives, but getting all parties to reach an agreement could lead to a headache for Parliamentary President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a bill for the name change over the next few weeks.
The legislation surrounding the reform will include other changes in how the National Assembly works, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the final right to vote on what they are to be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to “the Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to their territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country’s applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stilner – the crickets of Harlem are struggling
“The old men I spoke with have told me that before there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“None of the parts are there now.”
He said the bar's departure was understandable.
“People are socially interacting in different ways” today, he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling property will not last as long as the leaders think. “And sooner or later they are back at the beginning.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining resorts.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches will have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both wars were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin’s got a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem’s main shopping streets – for failing to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused major damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's son-in-law laid plans for reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly declared the carillon to be “the church bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complex interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are hired by the church’s lay leadership and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches - the leadership of the church, consisting of lay people - wrote to the diocese in July regarding its concern that the diocese would "try to impose costs" on the Council of Churches, despite the fact that the Council had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parish children complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured Thirteen-Year-Old in Hummer Dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was screaming out of enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but he eventually realized that the boy was shouting ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collarbone was torn up,” says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Bathing guard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its intake on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores across the country as part of a powerful intake in the UK’s 2.8 million beauty market, which is constantly growing while sales for clothing and household items are falling. If the attempt proves to be successful, the concept will be expanded to several stores.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's has said they will double the number of beauty products they offer to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also be better placed in notable brand areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its boutique makeup brand with mainly vegan products, as there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop is to test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales will eventually look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket picks up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration was discontinued after a dispute over the distribution of income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and design of the beauty shelves to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will then be ready to provide advice and help.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and the welcoming surroundings and convenient locations make us now a beauty pageant that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones Is ‘Frightened’ After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, who is the host of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their profitable lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-rimmed contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “rassing” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that television’s goldsmith admitted that her new deals – which are worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean she no longer has time to spare.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to leave Truly, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her vacation homes.
A source said: “Truthy was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to retire.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe the This Morning programme manager, who is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to story investment in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and costumes, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We don’t want to comment on his business affairs.”
“And then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider “little presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, even after declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “similar response” from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States, instead, still has sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an assembly of his voters.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his work to improve relations with Kim has yielded positive results, such as putting a stop to rocket tests, helping to release hostages and getting the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with the dignity of the president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rock an island and kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok residents had lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it’s quite challenging,” Sumbung said.
Save the Children is now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Crisis Management, said Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organisations will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering the constant earthquakes Indonesia is exposed to, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best of circumstances, it’s a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia’s downstream infrastructure a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which is due to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equaliser in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stanford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball climbed towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can be done, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it on.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker sent a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic came up with a quick turnover on the midfield.
He then fired a great breakthrough that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group game at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the Europa League in men's football in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia reaches 832
Death tolls following Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5-barrel that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from torn buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found dead at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would like to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact them – they may have information that is critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was a permanent resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway and the police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was aimless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents will now be informed that it will take several hours before they are allowed to enter again.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as an incident.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats, “It’s so terrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m. two police cars were behind the blockade, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the blockade and oversaw the apartment complex.
Persons with information are asked to send an instant message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, referring to “log 247” as of September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last monument to be dragged into the quarrel about "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
But the history team of the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Cricks publishing as "supposedly" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace was also going to be a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserves to be hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as Parliament’s defender of external pressure – in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-18th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and memorizing."
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only referred to by the surname “Yuan”, was found dead and covered in blood from a torn pulse vein near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had allegedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate to a nearby pig path was open.
He said there was a big mess inside the pig's mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and abused," the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, explained in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While police collected evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked inside to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan’s family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for death.
This is not the first time a pig has been reported to have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig weighing 300 kg until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive as usual, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious ... they don’t try to hurt anyone.
You just have to have enough respect.”
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves across the cooler ocean off the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rain on her journey through northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trench begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northwards toward the southwestern United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching trough will lead to widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
There are chances of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rains.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to turn into vast roaring rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to local wind gusts that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching thunderstorm will cause local heavy rainfall for parts of the coastline along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area’s first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue throughout Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics remain very hot.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of powerful temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are likely to have a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twentieth century from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, spread across six TV networks, saw Thursday’s gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's big surprise at the last second, when it emerged that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was likely seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average views for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
View counts were not immediately available to other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office spacers.
To give some perspective, this is the number of viewers that corresponds to the playoffs in the American Football Championship or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the network, with an average viewership of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the protagonist of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican’s office made a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, and on Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee meeting while protesters shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes lowered for several minutes while being peeled off, while the incident was broadcast directly on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling our country the truth?”
He was told that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, saying as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, as the court committee would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be extended to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate within next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after speaking with Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of ‘political game’ around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU to “play political games” with Britain’s future and undermine the nation’s interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called “Checkers” Brexit plan by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with intentional murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost their glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish prosecutor released a preliminary report on Friday stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and through the neck.
The Louisiana State Police's Task Force on the Recruitment of Refugees, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the locals are grateful for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU's sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area's police for his "hard work and pursuit of justice".
The Sims were 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in shock" after Wayne's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Disastres, Mexico’s public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a day.
The agency monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have detected increased activity from the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by rebel police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handguns also broke out later in the day, as police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independence protesters stood shouting “Never forget, never forgive,” face to face with Unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to local press.
Tensions remain high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority for de-election, but it was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by the majority who opposed the release.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets overnight to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s ability to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy about getting a vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties that support Catalan independence have had trouble keeping the pressure up this year, after many of their modestly known leaders have travelled in self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting trial on the sidelines of their role in arranging the people.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed in anticipation of a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Standing for election as a candidate in the European election is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armrest may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livinston surprised the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side now equals Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s side has still not won away in the Premier League this season and is set to play against the eight-point Hearts leaders next Sunday.
The Rangers will play their home game against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, for his part, has remained undefeated through six games in the division, with head coach Holt not yet losing a game after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for its lazy guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused innumerable problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick on after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The host let the Rangers play in front of them, well aware that they could make trouble for their guests at deathball.
And that’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a clear run, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage the Rangers had had the ball almost all the time, but the home team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a close scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide pass.
Crusades constantly entered the Livingston box and were constantly saved, while two penalties—once after Halket's protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once by hand—were ignored.
“Phenomenal” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have barely changed since they got to the top again, but Holt will have much of the honour for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration for me.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The final part of the game was a labyrinth – they only got into the home team’s half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
It was all just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There has been a split over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters came up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also protested, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy vault in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place just one month after a cyclist died in a drive-by where the driver escaped from the scene in Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday’s collision.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working on identifying the man and notifying the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus stops are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six police officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an incident at a men's high-security prison, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialised Tornado officers have been recruited to handle the incident, involving eight inmates and are limited to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind bars and beatings.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebel police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It is rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low pressure, but it is likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining force moves through desert areas in the southwest and carries flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainy season will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix has noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in the Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will likely get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of danger of flooding, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall will probably be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category,” according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first hits land on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind strength of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm intensity on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and cause great flood danger.
“Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with chances of rainfall of up to 25 cm,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected by Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening flooding and floating debris and fast in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4 a.m. on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who may have a mobile recording of the incident to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered from the pettyness and the mind” of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in front of a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the pettyness and mind” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his accusations during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and brave” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with impeccable custom in public service,” he told an assembly of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are aiming to “resist and prevent.”
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, an assistant to a Republican party leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves hovering at the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-metre-high waves hovered ashore around sunset, destroying everything in their way and dragging many into drowning death.
The tsunami hit the heels of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still carrying out activities on the beach, did not flee immediately and ended up being victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Crisis Management Agency (BNBP) told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it carried cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Crisis Management Act showed many broken buildings and shops, distorted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be the country's larger coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely cramped, completely without information" from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water pouring towards the beach, and with it rivers buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The military has started sending transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising to over 800.
It's awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached the center of Palu, where they have sought shelter under the tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major destruction along the way, according to Doseba Sinai.
“They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses,” he said.
It's awful.
As aid organizations began their grim preparations for delivering emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be let into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Great, this is a national disaster,’ we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not received any status yet.”
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that shed light on the grim news image after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was caught out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was released from rescue after spending two days trapped under rubble with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional shoulder to carry,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival in Palu.
However, the messages only led to gray nicks, rather than a few blue nicks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refuelling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker filling a Newport on the Levee cash desk, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a bank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy there was another man who "run up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a purse to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of their eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she canceled on an "emotional basis", according to the creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of brackets and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "never will use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of education lead young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, an investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, in turn, introduced a plan last year and aims to be the number one innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double AI research budget will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
"Double financial support can double the chance that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence will come from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat America's best Othello player, and later was a director at Microsoft Research or the director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence should receive offers of residence permits automatically,” he said.
China’s Council of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way that the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations allocate money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. law aimed at creating a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been halted for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to “the Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has vetoed to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the attendance will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price so that Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, can become a member of organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial, because a large enough number of MEPs have said they will comply with the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has said it had not received any irregularity reports by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country’s name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those to boycott the vote.
“We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we want to be registered with our heads up, not let in the back road,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our value.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Zaev says NATO membership will lead to badly needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He says a “yes” answer will be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manoeuvres past Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran the race with three Brighton defenders before coming out on the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoes to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him going to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough along his left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the deadline.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer to be a spoiler for the Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-competitive Scherzer still hopes to stand on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it could affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Even though we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of match I get to play at this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are supposed to be inclined to take Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power at all costs, and there you can see the pettyness and the ugliness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and prevent.”
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and ugly and ugly and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and mentioned the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, on which the audience bent out loud.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m waiting for one — it was very poor body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to all.
They don’t tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was going to be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On how important it is to have a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar things that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The note for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, more friendly” politics is long forgotten, if it ever began at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the Party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political positions with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed on, whether they were about the security of the nation or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I receive a wealth of nasty messages on social media that demand that I be deposed, denounce center politics and tell me I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And it’s not just me who’s experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet an ocean that gender-discriminating and racist comments every day, but never let go of the whip.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross segregation has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every distrust proposal and every change in the electoral rules becomes narrower.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the last two years where I’m encouraged to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government’s neglect that had caused my classroom in the public school I attended to to to be literally downgraded, I’ve been fighting for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and minister of government.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the motion on Friday, I just want to say that as the country is ravaging our way towards a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste my time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – that’s to those I represent, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of postponement or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think is best for your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly entertaining Tennet's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they were given that led to the home team's defeat, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“We have been challenged in our matches so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All the honor of Ayr, they were better at exploiting the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, with a goal kick from Frazier Climo giving Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a goal kick.
Climo reinforced Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before, just before the break, scoring and scoring a solo attempt to change the position to 17–5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This resulted in a lengthy stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruairidh Knott, who was carried out on a carrier, and from the restart Ayr's leadership further increased the oath of an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the pitch to the fullest with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team returned strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for dealing with Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by pitching behind the advancing Ayr mole.
Climo performed a goal kick, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's box kick and sent flankers Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth try.
Still the Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be on his way into the catering industry – it was recently discovered that he has been named as the director of a gifted restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, for which he writes and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duck has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is now planning his life for Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the case, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant business".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a riggin-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire inland country of Bolivia is still fresh in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody 19th century resource conflict, and the country yearns to once again sail in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be higher than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the drive, the spirit of community and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice ruling on a large screen in many different places in the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own expiry.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also invested heavily on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia’s side, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN agency, like the team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the latest arguments were heard suggesting that the case was “not complicated,” according to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that Morales's antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining benevolence on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia will give “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “set an end to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political cover-up.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Unless It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never dismantle its nuclear weapons if they can’t trust U.S. authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to initiate the locked-in nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desirable dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition is a declaration that ending the Korean War will ever force North Korea to its knees.
The U.S. government is sceptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really has plans to release an arsenal of the country is likely to be viewed as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris Reveal the Latest in Huge Headwear That’s Coming to a Clothing Store Near You
If you want some big additions to your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of strange, oversized headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the fashion lions at the fashion show in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most astonishing garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide brake that drowned the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard's hat, or even a pineapple, but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stained lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than last screams.
One creation resembled diving gear, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cookies.
And if you’re looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be on their way to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of “La Bomba”, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, lined with raffia fringes and complemented with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the fashion store in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact it will be hard to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for the citizens of the world
Schottland’s free schools are constantly exhibiting academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with yet another year of excellent exam results. These are supported by individual and shared success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, working hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and in demand elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of qualifications from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the exam grade A.
The data, obtained from 74 member schools of the Free School Council, showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject choice are now valued at the same level as real sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics on curriculums for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons employers reported having problems occupying a vacancy, 17 percent could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will provide real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language education is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered most valuable to the UK on the way towards 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from at kindergartens, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish health schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in the teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and the award to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is not yet decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell tweeted that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
“I don’t need preseason matches at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump’s People’s Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
The president is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled people’s meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia People’s Meeting tonight, and how can it be viewed online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote is put on hold for up to one week as the FBI investigates the case.
The main goal of all these referendums is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five plenary meetings over the next few weeks are aimed at “enhancing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesperson told Reuters.
The rally, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and is covered by the Pittsburgh press,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows spirit of struggle to keep faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup of the year needed.
The momentum swing pendulum is a completely fictional sporting concept, yet something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we're probably carrying it with us as a little momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left the pitch for the day.
Europe will of course have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they’ve got some wind back on the sails, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration screams became louder as his round continued, sinking to a decisive putting to raise the match to the draw when he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows that he still does not believe the American team is hopeless.
“We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who undoubtedly are Ryder Cup’s great success story.
Europe’s unusual but wonderful couples have four out of four and do not set a foot in error.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the live crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players in the audience will see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily came up with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourball hero, when he partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniards and Swedes were so far behind that they had no chance of regaining the lead.
But on Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely due to the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the spirit of struggle some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe lead 10-6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cup last day, after finishing Sunday's fourball and foursomes with 10-6 lead against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European side, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unhappy side in the morning fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursomes and won two matches, but they were unable to regain any of the lead.
Jim Fury's side must score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked seamlessly to beat down Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who stayed through two matches on Saturday, glimpsed from time to time, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three in the world.
But Europe did not get everything as they wanted on this hot day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has managed to recover from a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders only Furyk's side needs to achieve a draw in order to retain the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn’t seem like they’ll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “not in any way” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened its distrust of the United States and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally drop its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, for example by halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we have no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints of Washington’s opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work towards “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first drop its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ lifting pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can push us to our knees is a dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in front of the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the Korean Peninsula nuclear disarmament would not have been as tightly locked as it is.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland U.S. with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the United Nations this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he had no time frame for this, saying that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after North Korea accused him of making “procedural demands.”
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile range and a nuclear weapons facility if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had said that these “corresponding measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is designed to help students get more sleep by tackling the growing ukulele of poking through the night with caffeinated beverages as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best universities often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students how important good sleep habits are to be able to perform academically and athletically, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to start the course after seeing students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is to a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risks of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to crawl all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be students’ “secret weapons” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even as a means against weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the professor’s classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put on an alarm for when to lie down as well as for when to stand up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the 24-hour rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Menga's goal hit Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted their first win since February's 4–1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
The men beat to seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to make up.
The Rangers now fall down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the game for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown out of the public.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been delighted with how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the match when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
The Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game leaned more on hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty kick after a quarter when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get away players to play exactly the kind of match they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett catching up long balls after long balls.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the final round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late penalty kick claim when he came into conflict with the Jacobs, but again saw Thomson away.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Plate
And now a page from the “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we now know as the Geiger Plate.
The violin has been an important part of science ever since, and also became a part of popular culture through the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “I have to say it makes sound now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Cancer Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and then injected back into the patient.
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was given the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of different types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came up with strong defenses by Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was curled up in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a captivating performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he stretched out against the Democrats and reiterated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and then he says, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“If I were afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording by West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the public that he was allowed to hear it in the back room regarding the choice of headwear.
“They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said I don't understand what reality is," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want me to understand what reality is?” he said, saying that he should “take on my Superman coat, because then no one can say what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try the love.”
His comments were curved at least twice, and the employees working at SNL looked embarrassed, reported Variety, in which a staff member said: “The whole studio was deadlocked.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR YOUR IMOT MASSES.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’ which I believe cultivates and spews out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was "the entity formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and then of course the late Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendants are expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The target will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lashes out at 'given masculinity'
Kit Harington is known for the role of sword wingman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero saying such roles on film often make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these <0x23>MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very concerned about the theme.
“I’m pretty worried about it right now – what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that TV may have some of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what is it that makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this very side by being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any precursor or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will play the lead role in a remake of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that got something good out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in whom Kit's character Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says a health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, which marks a change from the previous one.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised public access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects leaked data on Republican senators, sniffing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday rejected allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insured by the allegations was made by “ultra-conservative” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the allegations of abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely inaccurate and a regular lie,” Waters said.
“The members of my staff – who have had their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these dishonest and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely inaccurate and a regular lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not defend.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to be calm and understanding.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "relevant authorities and police of these false accusations".
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloodless Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit performances in all new films with a British twist and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are becoming the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his blinking eyes and the rubber face has renewed his license to rot it to the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended in territories with non-English-speaking cinema audiences.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dude Mr. Bean, and a portion of that guy who contributes with a single note in the fire truck theme music set during the opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
It’s a great moment in the last Johnny English trip.
I loved how Johnny English approached a medieval-style helicopter and the rotor blades snowed his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is coming to fruition, but the humour feels rather bloodthirsty and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brands like 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away feature comedy.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades are not as inventive and spicy as the silent-film melodies in Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the vigilante agent – an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure who’s already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of Teresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been revealed, she must bring in some of the retirees.
And that means the clown Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobbish establishment, but unofficially teaches secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here when English offers a rock academy for espionage activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, shattered by a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class female role where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin's style of rotting everything up on a mission for the Queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the deceitful Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with farsighted side-steps: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a dazzling French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta’s house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so lovely and noisy it is so there is a lot that resembles children's TV with the whole thing.
Quite mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets his talent used?
Labour denies drawing up plans to let the British work four-day week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will give the British four-day work week – but get paid for five.
The party is likely to want corporate leaders to spend savings on the artificial intelligence revolution by giving workers an extra day off.
This will result in employees getting a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to the four-day week so that employees can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing for the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised four-day weeks during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary election.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the party’s policy and is not something that is considered by the party.”
Financial policy spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profits” of public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting the entire shareholding back because a Labour government can make “deductions” based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and create employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity to private sector companies to employees, who can get an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham in "60 Minutes" if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, confident, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice appears to have been carved in stone.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it had to be a startling finding,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to combat poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to flock to the great lawn in Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that aims to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a variety of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteer work, send an email to a world leader, take a phone call, or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradication of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from followers since 2011, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped make world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs to “help children to exploit their full potential,” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Ci.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand together stronger.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy as ‘Blocked’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern side of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The U.S. has the ability through the navy to make sure the seaways are open and, if necessary, blockages to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far on the same path.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilise and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project The North European Gas Pipeline 2, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow’s “captive.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Northern European gas pipeline, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have big problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” about her 2020 presidential nomination, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During a voter meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she will remain silent.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the chess-driven government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether I will be running for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the voter turnout and said he "led the country in the wrong direction".
“I’m worried to the brink of what Donald Trump is doing to democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe she should run for office in 2020.
58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not be silent, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's Electoral Meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with them,” she told the audience at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, breaking up with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police.
18 States and D.C. Support Trial of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal attempt at a new policy in the United States that denies asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from amicus curiae (a friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang members’ sons” abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Court of Appeal for Immigrants that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State Attorney Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy “looks away from many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum claims to be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to that principle,” the statement said.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that denied immigrants access harms the U.S. economy and says they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and "contribute to the necessary labor."
Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in the June 11 announcement on the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the bustling city of Palu.
“You always see ambulances picking up dead people.
Clean water is deficient".
One could see residents coming to broken homes and lightening through water-damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were injured in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes as he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I was hugged by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Tracking” with “Propaganda”
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that discerned the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the annex China Daily paid to step into the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s top-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an allegation China rejects.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
While it is normal for foreign authorities to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imported goods.
China's fines early in the trade war were to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts reported.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader post in Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China is now escalating the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are exploiting the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to insert a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will not find many divergent opinions and will not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh fades, analysts warn
As many top Republican politicians support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several allegations of sexual assault directed against him, analysts warn that they will get a counterreaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiments around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for a last-minute FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget yesterday’s events – they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate hallways when Republicans controlling the Justice Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which gave a detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts thought it would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced through the nomination.
“This has become a happy mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed — it’s also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents were fully or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were fully or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s fabrication.
In addition, 38% said they were completely or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake play, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitalia while they were at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data is to be stored and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is “world dominance.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to let people create their own “personal data warehouse online” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about personal data storage online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is that the company should provide resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely recalculated overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even though he is launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross recipient from World War I
The only priest in the English church to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honorary title on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a “great symbolism” for the stone to be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29 – “through very thick fog and under heavy firing from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he crashed into the firing line and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field cannon independently and striking out three of the divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he was “very honored to play a role in the parade,” adding that “the bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans were up all night to watch the martial arts program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you’ve stayed awake all night to see the tight-knit Bellator 206, just to discover that you won’t see the main game.
The San Jose participant managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, viewers in the UK were sitting to watch when the picture suddenly showed Peppa Pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early in the morning to see the match.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke".
“It’s state regulation that it’s not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6:00, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will be working on the broadcast plan to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning there on Sunday, and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me - when we passed, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly sort.
We tried to fix it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn’t, it was a government.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five matches – which we usually send out – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of sexuality
Olympic stuntman Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until he realized in high school that “he wasn’t like everyone else.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual programme manager for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, will be away for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared as a bit of a loser on Laverne's first show and said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have given me the strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time Olympic bronze winner and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels lucky that he can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that his falling in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about me just having to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had gotten tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formswake Mickelson taken out to the Ryder Cup golf tournament on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he had so often been for the United States, it shares the five-time major-winner’s day between being the cheerleader and working on his game on the ranks in the hopes of fixing what scumbags.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career, and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National, where the long rough area continues to punish stray hits.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s games can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a slap on my back and put my arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams before, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I looked for more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny and likes to have sex with others. He’s a great guy to have in the storage room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He’s giving more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows his great leadership could soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant management at the entrance to the last day’s singles game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but scored the win with the least margin possible, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that’s to try to win this trophy, and that’s where the focus lies.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is another challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements are at the center, and there is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the fullest.
It is the message that you must convey to the players that they must get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners. The exception are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major upheavals last day, joining the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe performed the “miracle at Medinah”.
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, had harassed his players at the entrance to the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, like we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to move in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We then arrange our setup and send people out the way we feel, you know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the match and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the game order.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warships delayed once again
German navy's latest frigate was supposed to have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the drivership of the all-new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to be handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class Navy ordered all the way back in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
However, steady delays mean that the advanced warships – which were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be outdated before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the yard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including training of the crew – has also become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion – from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany’s navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy is actually “empty for usable ships”.
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were outsourced, but there were no new vessels.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Fleas
New research conducted at a farm in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown longtails and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be part of the decision on what measures should be taken, such as the establishment of pastures and how best to care for the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work affecting breeding grounds and habitat constraints.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as attacks from household cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for the ears than the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping of nesting sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Thrave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of mapping the bats before maintenance is carried out on a property since accidental destruction of a single breeding ground can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps eradicate an entire local population.
Fleas are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them or destroy their nesting grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish collaborator for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don’t know how the populations cope.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as "fake news" and says people "want fame" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 in return for keeping close to the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” says five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the footballer adds with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable presentation of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the footballer will demand compensation for “reputation damages to an extent equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was failed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later entered into conciliation outside the court because she was "fearful of revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly suspended."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will mourn forever' over loss of car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delayed border crossings in a possible no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, see production at our factory stalled,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what automakers say is supply chain risks in a possible no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “ordering as needed” and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a stay at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is “precisely geared to avoid such border checks.”
“We want to have the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said the members are increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed one more week” as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump aides and Russia, as well as possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy justice minister or not, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, has been simmering for many months during speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up talks with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to leave voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather let go" of firing Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI one-week investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed a full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s postponement because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Programmed Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to reluctance to TV reporters’ “self-righteousness,” although she added: “I don’t disagree that they are self-righteous.”
Then she suggested that contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
“The president is doing more rounds of questioning than any previous president,” she said, adding, “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to get it done often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in recent weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause as he ran a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens who work in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have taken place through the summer and are expected to land on a solution this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of the healthcare service to the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennesseean newspaper.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first round was over.
“He came out on the sideline and sort of just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a carrier and taking him behind for further examination.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/size of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he finished the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with the promise of offering more affordable housing and targeting high-income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s efforts to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson came up with proposals for a cut in document fees to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May have to reject quotas on affordable housing in order to resolve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a staggering array of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unwarranted drafts.
He also wants to give municipal councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For so many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too distant, and the unworthy situation for the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there’s always something that pulls me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not worried about following such established names in the big club, and has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League".
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’d probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' coaching loss.
Then he helped Alloa recover from downhill to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of downhill to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real road divide,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought management was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some nice highlights.

There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.

This summer’s heatwave has boosted revenue for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July – while restaurant revenues fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who summarized the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup participation led to July following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than restaurants went down.
Pubs with food serving also struggled with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the restaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6.6% that month, with food serving falling by 3%.”
Paul Newman, analyst at the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8% year-on-year turnover will be particularly painful at the peak of ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a much-anticipated breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including reopenings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.

One in Five Children Have Secret Social Media Accounts They Hide From Parents
One in five children – some are just 11 years old – have secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers, study shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students uncovered pages with “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children – some are just 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to photo-sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors’ Conference for Private Schools (HMC), revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international level over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletic environment, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will enjoy getting her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has a total of four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after a transient ischemic attack she was unable to walk.
She tweeted: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m fine again and I’ve learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad that compares mothers with cows splits opinion online
A breast pump company has split opinion online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first soundless breast pump worn tightly to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirty, music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of heights and cows to a song with the following lyrics: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t realize it, this is not swearing, it’s my tits”.
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bowls.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many say it paints the “wretches” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth,” one wrote.

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “What a failed ad.”
Others defended the ad, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I'm still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cowboys.’
This is not an advertisement that pays homage to or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discrete pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and gets a nice place in a breastfeeding bra, allowing women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and breastfeeding, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of detained migrant children has gone up even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to enter fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the immigration and customs authorities, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people seeking to be supportive of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either supporters or members of supporters’ households are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” says Albence.
Police are trying to deal with the children faster and introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days as the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via video conferencing instead of meeting in person to bring their case for a residence permit to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered to be illegitimate asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater their risk of experiencing anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the sysem in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who are struggling are more easily overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can intensify the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces were staying illegally on Syrian soil under cover of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said Damascus will continue to “lead this sacred struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” both for terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational flight” that causes the refugees to stay away.
“We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The US and EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defense position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee of state and opposition members to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem put forward conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “a review of the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Another Period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping, federal law and scandals will put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there is no sign of starvation.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped cable numbers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news items.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course – unlike everything else on TV – the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Exit is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch yourself far to be an enlightened human when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “deepness in the background fabric” for the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with strawberry feathers...
I don’t want to see Super Mario anymore.
“Some of what he’s doing that makes it look like a reality show is that he’s giving you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s varied cast and daily twist on the plot.
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hanging out.
When I met Fleiss this week, there were 27<0xC2><0xB0>C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged himself in and looked at MSNBC as he picked up CNN.
He could not tear himself apart, not when Brett Kavanaugh will meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake.
“I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the most regular midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th District is experiencing a flow of money after a congressional district redevelopment that ended up with two sitting representatives battling for the same seat.
This newly rebuilt suburban district in Pittsburgh is running with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Old Pennsylvania’s 12th District, which largely overlaps the new 17th District.
The map was retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of the constituencies in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a snap victory in a closely followed supplementary election for Pennsylvania’s 18th District to Congress in March last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
US Considered Penal Measures against El Salvador for Support to China, Then Pulled the Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials deferred a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, halting all plans for punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the collection, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of prosecution, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in meddling in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, amid preparations to meet the electorate again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don’t mean to claim that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be a choice made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had risen up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tilt points, and the irresistible march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
Americans are facing several of these tilt points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in severe weather ever since this newspaper reported that he last year proposed secret interrogations of the president and speculated that he was unsuitable to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times's presentation is incorrect.
“What will we do if the recent FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the midterm elections for a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail because of the experience I had in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me away to light sabbatical candles on the table with the oak cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will take Rapid Vienna on Thursday, confident that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and got a point.
Maybe we could have nicked in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last match, but with the home audience in the back I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put the previous season behind us and get it done.”
Women Lose Night Sleep Due to Fear of Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Get rid of legal issues right away.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to keep track of your medical care, and making sure that health care workers will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some power over your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that record in place.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an airgun while on his way home after an evening.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an “unmotivated act.”
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and death tolls are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a rainforest that extends along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region under the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the Sulawesi economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency relief administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Rim and is hit regularly by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that ravaged dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A grim earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the eruptions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, breaking up with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison and is being arrested for an unsecured debt letter worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when asked how he dealt with the question of guilt, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offences, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can be punished with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a lawsuit has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is brought before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, crackdown on the domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death tolls are expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami plunged into the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been exercised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he shot down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused serious bodily harm on purpose, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for a possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slammed the 22-point sentence, including eight charges of murder in connection with extortion, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and vehicle wreckage.
The attack required "significant planning and intention," the prosecutor said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "horrible, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property creations and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco". fix.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could bring the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty after the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s publicly appointed defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been eradicated” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided lines has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted she would go on trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had the responsibility, we would be out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
To explain his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the allegations that the referendum had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration, telling reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who rattle the streets and get us elected in the first place.
“Reject the Brexit plan and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would “feel the pressure” if they thought of betraying the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is about the trust between us – the people – and those politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the centre of the city.
A small number of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app as the conference began.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts was talking about the future during a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the vice president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation about whether she will stand against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the city hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to come to Washington to fix our faulty government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Police Arrested After LSU Sims Killed in Shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20, were shot and killed near a campus at Southern University early Friday.
“The Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result,” Murphy J. Paul, the chief of police, told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene carrying weapons, and admitted to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without rioting and held in custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish police officers.
Sims was a two-metre-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton points to World Champion title after stall orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stall order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and swept Hamilton off the field as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to drive in the rear of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels that reluctantly left the Ferrari driver inside after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in at number seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he led much of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen who was number four.
He finally passed the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job of getting a good two-team,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her detention that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
While speaking during an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil, ugly, and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and evil and ugly and speaking untrue,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer...you leaked the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added, with an imitation of the senator’s voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she requested.”
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who during the party event on Saturday night commented: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
“You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received a two-goal lead by shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie offset for the home team before Dwyer restored management for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard offset for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for the Adam Keefes men, who had come behind after beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford quit the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt moved up to Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again offset by a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the late second half of the match, and he secured the victory with the team's five half-way out in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are playing at home against the Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Flight Guide Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Air Passengers Escape Earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after his death and ensured that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely lighten.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved many hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“Numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-metre-high waves have torn Palu apart, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “You always see ambulances picking up dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after plane crashed in lagoon
The airline, which owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one man is missing, previously reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as they attempted to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all of them was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Witnesses said the plane crashed on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a pier also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to transport people on land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water level.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in a crash with PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed the proceedings on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to what he had previously claimed, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness booth on Saturday and claimed he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said he " lied because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records suggest that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-driven hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origins of political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-driven hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a new boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for resignation after 'racist' message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory resignation after receiving a wrongful message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies that they are racist and compares the lawsuit with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII END A BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their dismissed childcare provider, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her resignation and demanding compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the six-month-long, shelter-based scheme she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that — hey, you just don’t,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back on accusations that they are racist and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right, since they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on, come on."
The comparison of the lawsuit with "extortion" says Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to term and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
It’s not very nice,” added the stock broker.
As the legal case progresses, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was believed, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we know now about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a little cloth bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book publishing was "bitter sweet" after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father secretly was very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn’t a proud person,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid doing a good job: you’re proud of it even if it’s not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine doctors had given her to make the heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a little earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it happened.
I couldn’t scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she says.
“I looked down all the time and tears ran in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he was depressed and killed when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day,” she says.
Sharon, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They said his smile could light up any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he killed him.
Sharon says: “I’m constantly worried that there will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon created the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit down for yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon’s friend for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn’t get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “There’s a big hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
We all have to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread as the FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get something out of what he asked for — a time- and scope-limited investigation — maybe we could come to a certain agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall apart” along locked party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The resistance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 – if Republicans are likely to do bad, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and ran lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him in the Supreme Court.
North Korean snipers 'fall' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea’s collection department, said there had been 1,127 jumps last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most North Koreans will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the smugglers as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with force.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the lockdown negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally degrade first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unsuitable to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could only think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes he almost shouted and was crying when he talked about his family and the years of high school.
He also strongly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a “great and coordinated character assassination” organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony shows he cannot sit in the Supreme Court since it shows he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s sitting in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he was considered a conservative judge.
In the enquiry, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It’s a just anger, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was amazing.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable anger and was caught in the neck of an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little scared of – who took me to a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad and be happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on his husband aboard a boat called Monkey Business and withdrawing from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones needed was one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she lay behind with the funding and vowed that she would not stand if she didn’t get $2 million in cash.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asks.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to push in money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism – that she collapsed in tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
“You should have thought Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
‘She was crying?’”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and even if the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The main escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning tariffs on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing, of course, has retaliated every time, now at the latest with an estimate of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match US attacks for attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy will probably not raise the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States could give China a positive outlook in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic ring effects in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have realized before,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to restore the country, which has been torn apart after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they may have left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still live in the country, in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the insurgency would not be accepted.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe have won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who suffered during much of the tournament, avoided his tee shots in the water at par-3 16th hole, and had to be beaten by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could be of help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the relay stick to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely when I was growing up,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
That was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to look into the future.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
