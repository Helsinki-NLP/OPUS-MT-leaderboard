Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, ended up even worse.
These are the worst outcomes of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Back in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
Now, voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were made.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party’s leadership.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the way to the outcome of the election result that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Nevertheless, given the reinforcement of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11 percent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the same party, which was in fact the party of the populists, was in agreement with the Union itself, in 2005.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently bet on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they slightly lost and rebounded, among Austrian political parties, from third to fifth.
Obviously, no other party exceeded the four percent limit and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool down
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused of illegally harvesting cockroaches in India could not be solved, then, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced it today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee says, coming out of talks, that executive power could hardly intervene in court cases.
He noted, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
As a result, he could seek bail and await the release of the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
“We want above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The minister evades the question of whether he has obtained the promise from India to take care of the matter.
“I’ve already received quite a number of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbitrator fights for the seabed
It is approaching an electronic wall map, on which is represented Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is however as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The passion for work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A more vast land than the land holds
The coastal States have today begun to aspire vehemently to the new underwater territories.
In fact, according to a UN convention, they exercised their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all resources of the continental shelf.
"For simplicity, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” Mikulka explains.
The country's request to the Commission for the Establishment of the External Borders of the Continental Shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous costly prospects and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests, namely those of Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater holdings, has recently experienced a global recession.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which the commission awarded it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which is the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The profits they will make in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no other state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "their areas are clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the Eastern countries within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States, it obtained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of such a practice.
It resembles a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists of the Federal Army and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Air Force Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts of the Technischen Hilfswerk, were on the scene of the release.
As the ministry spokesperson said on Monday evening, German forces were finally not required, with hostages liberating their prisoners and fleeing when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted Germany's assistance in integrating it on the ground as a support force.
"Thankfully, that hasn't happened so far," a spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were relocated to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained vague so far, as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been rescued have now arrived safely and securely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are expected to have taken off aboard an Airbus air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed little in the $700 billion financial market bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was sinking into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout plan for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to quell the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote in favour even though the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
While still voting, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concerns that the state bailout plan could overcome.
It dates back shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the failure, fall again.
Experts are now projecting serious new turbulence in international financial markets.
For the program to come into force, approval and the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year – for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite the low economic outlook, the Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one third.
Apart from that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
The trips organized in particular are in great demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be here "more easily computable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also well-regarded so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip has declined compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in spikes to litre and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television animator and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer festival, and already the photographers are throwing themselves at us and filling their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer festival.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was limited so far.
But once in Theresa Square, everything is half worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; nobody looks blatant or embarrassed - this is completely normal.
Only the ribbon of my Tyrolean suit picks up a few odd eyelashes at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman makes me remark that I would have wrongly attached my tabloid: "on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right broken, in the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripod my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others don’t get so bad for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written “Too drunk to get dressed!” and exposes us their back train naked without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with an elongated "oooooo."
He's telling me all this after he's relieved himself of the booze he used to drink.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild piers".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers' ribs run into the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in a packet - still by four, they drag their civics covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we return full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunken under the cloth are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," one of the rescuers yells at me in response to my question and then disappears into the mess.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosporus, 20 steps away from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each angle, like some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a transition to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and has the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is a form of sabotage.
Since then, it slowly falls into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed wagon to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Su<0xC3><0xA2>t Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a ten-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken by noisy rails whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new century state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built in stone and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many pastries in which middle managers in costume-cravate- men and women- meet for business.
Suat Kinikiloglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The purpose of this foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for either of them.
She had to do both.
“But, at some point, ‘I asked if’ Turkey should not choose?”
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all of those with whom I have been able to talk, have recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea itself, is therefore, as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least, there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us over the age of 20- refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the choir's willingness and ability to manage any type of music presented to him, whether Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod used to say, “Let the music speak for itself.”
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His barge technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of grandeur and modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “focus only on certain people.”
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history, at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
That’s what came out of Woodruff’s letter in Beyond Nab End, but that’s not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "The Flamenco and Life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault for Honda's Super Sales
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
A few refined mechanics are added to this, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be emphasized that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation is launched.
First of all, it is noted that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time frame than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
For example, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it thought to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Officials of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely cover the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company expects to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% drop in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to get a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is expected in the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters in addition), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters in addition) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change either 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the box – which has a double bottom system – can contain up to 399 liters, 19 liters more capacity compared to the first generation box.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the casing capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation – in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof – is the improvement of the access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, on the other hand, the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C represents the growth of Nissan’s security shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee’s composite eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterruptedly inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is called a laser range finder.
It detects the obstacles that are at a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"As soon as it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forging its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device must only process information and act on that data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of previous manoeuvres, so it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into standard cars in a decade, according to Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of liquidity to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's 'the hotel of bad credits'... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It is no longer a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel .
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley Opens Capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a sharp decline in its stock price.
A week after revealing an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total amount of $3 billion.
The deducted price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a yield of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, which is 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley's stock, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 by 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but puts him under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest Wall Street names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been changed in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s chief executive, explained in Tokyo, “we thought the participation would be entirely made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or at about $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that MUFG’s capital will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A group spokeswoman, however, refused to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had “slightly” lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been stressful for the group, which saw its stock market price melt by half as the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt went away.
The cost dropped on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-founding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like its counterparts and friends, it was the third one that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of polling stations and a countdown from a non-governmental organization announced a broad "yes" victory, ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed in the night from Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place calmly according to the Observation Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution dedicates the power of the state to the economy, preserving it with the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its immigrants.
Powered by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and hold a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of the free provision of health and education services that the President began to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safely and soundly to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at al-Maza military base, which was escorted to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, unable to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in “good health,” and “no ransom was paid” to the kidnappers,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been balloted from one cache to another by 35 unknown abductors.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the safari agency Aegyptous.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, carrying two helicopters, had launched the attack the night before dawn.
"There was an exchange of gunfire, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," the official said.
He said 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We have to recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and efficiency of our secret service men, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were aboard, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is the headlines and occupies the present election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or to national historic sites that breed hunger?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Québec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Québec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with researching history, preserving with three under private archival mounds, and preserving vestigies.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and policymakers throw their bulldozers at our forgotten old stones and cemeteries.
When, a platform for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states come to the aid of the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries also support interest, in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion in Hongrias and these institutions.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourgish and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, by also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis intensifying for more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank’s capital located in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis stocks began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to let go of bankruptcy.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of overseas, in connection with the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout plan, of being the cause of the fall of Fortis stocks.
On Monday, the paperwork had already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
There was no panic in the bank’s clientele circle, and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken house
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information relating to the prescription of medicines, in any case, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it’s about assigning its chicken to a fox,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told The Washington Post.
Insurance companies rely on the insurance premium and the insured capital in the event of damage, on the client’s state of health, and if they feel the risk is too high, they don’t even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after learning of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily provides himself with pharmacies, data about the person's drug purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines himself, what health he or she is suffering from.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, it refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer except the paperwork. However, small problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heatstroke, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have grown in data research and analysis, and they need to ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory tests, linking them with data on drug consumption, and thus being able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of usage is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to expand the authorities' control circle on companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give their consent or not, because if they refuse, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with them.
Thus, and ultimately, the chickens depend on the kindness of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where it will be mainly about cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a broader voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not get too caught up in this issue yesterday at this 9th summit in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in a hundred years, they were going to multiply by one thousand, two times as many as exchanges.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has increased from $25 billion to $55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, so that air traffic can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and, on the other hand, New Delhi, which only ranks ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need for a United Nations conference on this topic has been raised.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains true to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that a global market should be held at the climate conference scheduled next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and have supported the convening of an international working meeting to address the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is on a visit to the French capital, where he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
Francesco Maria Giro, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson has cleared the remaining doubts: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington to Nevada.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a pullover.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long set of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he toured the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among all these records, also the one to have flown at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
In short, Glk, the last born of the "compact" off-road of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Precisely by its off-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from 17 October next.
Thus, the advertising campaign that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, you will have the impression that when you look at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative technology Eliminata8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whom Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" who has been following the Italian national team for years, and who, until now, had never created big problems.
He had never met the other typhoons.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little actually) from Campania and Apulia were added.
They had three-colored flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday evening, they were all taken away for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English typhoid.
In Bulgaria, they found a series of real Nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had made available the Italian typhoons, 144 tickets for the game: all nominal, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had them all in control: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the riots purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer stand in the stadium.
Luckily.
But now it's time for fear-emulation: that is, others are likely to be added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves in this way," Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Apulia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory will meet, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Comfort, that is, secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly prefect of Trieste where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhoides was shameful.
“I am not a sociologist,” the Observatory adds, “crimes must be attributed in the country where the crime occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whispers to Mameli’s anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite...”
