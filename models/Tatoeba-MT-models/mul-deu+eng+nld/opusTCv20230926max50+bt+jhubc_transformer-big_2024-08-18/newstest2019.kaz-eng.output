As an independent citizen of Kazakhstan, as a child of my Kazakh-speaking nation, I openly condemn the followers of these Red Gendes!
If our country is truly an independent state, then the president of this country will openly punish them, who threatens the eternal independence of Kazakhstan, as the country's sellers, or the entire country, as if they were openly punished by the people!

So we'll see.
But in general, I'm going to say my point.
We've got an area that's been named after the locals, and we've got a local area that's been there.
If the name of the city of Kostanay is called Torg<0xC4><0x81>y, then it is necessary to work on the restoration of the previous name.

First of all, it is a question of the funding allocated to the implementation of the State programme.

Last year, a total of 11.2 million square meters of housing were delivered and a high figure was reached.
The Prime Minister recalled the need for the use of 12.1 million square meters.
Therefore, the governors of the districts were instructed to take all the necessary measures to deliver the planned volume of the residential house and to effectively manage the allocated funds.
The second is the issue of providing engineering communications to the construction sites.
This is true for many homes and for the construction of a home.
Half of the budget allocated to the implementation of the Bill's State Programme is aimed in this direction.
Also, B.Sakuntayev said that since there was no need for infrastructure in some regions, the houses that were being built were not being allowed to be used.
This year, more than 40,000 landlines are expected to be provided for a private home, with only 40% being provided in 9 months.
Therefore, the governors of the provinces were instructed to closely monitor the matter and ensure that the tasks were carried out in the next two months.

As part of the ongoing development of legal education, a memorandum was signed on the establishment of the "Tatulasu" center between the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Federation of Trade Unions.
Today, it is working together with professional mediators and courts to work on the resolution of disputes, social and other issues.

His work, however, was only intriguing.
Today, apart from the "Tatulasu" center, a mediation office is operating in the vicinity of each regional and regional court.
The main task of the mediators is to resolve the dispute in court.
On the other hand, the Court of Appeals is working.

The measure was carried out with the support of the F. Ebert Foundation in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
