Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane home win at opening - Savo Volley second win
Hurricane-Loima, who has won seven consecutive men's volleyball medals in the Champions League, started the 2018-19 season with the home draw, when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective player in the Hurricane.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't happen, and then came a call from the Navy.
We were able to get things done very quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen also played with Loimusak, who supported Kouki by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team hacker Samuli Kaislasalo, who played on a match-specific contract with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side as well, and it brought extras into the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the medal pipe is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Determining the most effective Savo Volley
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most effective 18 points, when the team defeated the Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was awkward, especially at the top of the attack, but luckily we got a squeezed win.
“At least I didn’t have any conscious different downloads when I played against my former team,” Möttänen said.
In the season 2000-01, Antti Siltala scored 12 points in the Neverän Lentoballo 3 series.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
Good filis left from home opening.
Miro was a mule, Sillikik also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Bridget's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavede Sammosa while Tuovisen was the head coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective at 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley's star
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen, the winner of the league’s scoring table, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening win after defeating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started in its own right.
Today, of course, was a close loss, as we were fourth in a 17-21 loss.
There was a lottery win, and the fifth lot came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most efficient finisher was 28 points scored by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudryashovs supported by 17 points.
There was hardly any catch in the guy’s hacker, Mikkonen praised.
Finland ranks first in the world in comparison of human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison of human capital, says the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the first in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Subsequently, the Netherlands ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
The measurement of human capital examines the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, the local game ended in goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois pulled out on the glitter, and the Madrid team's local game ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest goalscorer, but the Belgian guard Courtois managed to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico on loan three times as a Chelsea player.
In the first week, FIFA selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale won the best spot, but his shot was directed past the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale stayed on the exchange after the break because of more traveling.
According to ESPN, disappointed fans of Real shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the goalkeeper who moved to Juventus.
U.S. Is Now Attacking the Right to Abortion - A Powerful Document Tells Why
The U.S. Senate is trying to find out if one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could elect President Donald Trump’s nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive vote of Kavanaugh could be reversed against the decision known as Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights tells how the current situation has come over the years.
As amazing as it seems, the topic is also current in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received varying degrees of support from the majority of our country’s MEPs.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas is found, who has become the only doctor in the state of Missouri to make abortions due to legal crackdowns.
An armed warden at the clinic says he defends American religious freedom.
The news videos are reminiscent of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
It was a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, an association of Lutheran churchmen led women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact, they are not even needed, a photo of the woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States every year.
The Republican Party, in particular, advocated the legalization of abortions.
In 1967, the abortion law was signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan.
It was later that Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, began to invert religion into politics in order to confuse voters.
His abortion stand was also run by his successor George Bush the Elder.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document goes to the heart of the matter in its search for the basis for the politicization of abortion.
When religious organizations that favor racial segregation were denied tax exemptions, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a rodent horse.
Religion has brought exceptional nodes to politics.
In writing this, in the United States, we are in a situation where the president, who has been lauded by the sultanic harassment but caught by the vote of religious right in his abortion stand, has elected Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, which many women are now accusing of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children, at large-scale demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year since Israel fired protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made a demonstration in the border zone as demonstrators threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says it has begun the use of force that the demonstrators do not dismantle the border fence or aim for it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commissioner, 12,000 people are injured.
The protesters called for Palestinian families to enter the areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives fired from the Palestinian side by lions and helium bullets have set forests and farmland on fire in Israel.
Theme Punk got a penalty kick - you didn't get to shoot yourself
Wigan's top Chey Dunkley seemed to have smashed him in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward gave the game a sequel.
According to his interpretation, the backbone was clean.
Theemu Pukki couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation seems to be bothered by arbitrator Wardia, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Pukki was shot.
Ward looked like a penalty kick, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
The puck has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship Series.
The former was born last Saturday against QPR in a stylish manner with a chest muscle.
The work was good for Puki again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end.
He created painting situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, it was the fifth game in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There's a five-way win line behind it.
Pedophiles' help service immediately filled the bookings - in Finland about 40,000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet paedophiles as clients and helps people who have a sexual interest in children.
When the project was told in the spring, an email flood started at Sexpo, which offers counseling and therapy, and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are expected to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a disgrace to many people.
Most of the people who notice the pedophile feelings themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and have thus done nothing criminal.
Preference, however, is usually a permanent attribute.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass and vilify them.
They also complicate normal life, says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist who works as a specialty expert on the project.
“I think work is valuable if one child is spared from sexual violence,” Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the Nobel Peace Prize winner – the idea may sound suddenly strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize based on betting odds.
Trump’s role in North Korea’s commitment to nuclear disarmament, at least at the level of speeches.
The most popular Nobel Peace Prize winners are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the Koreans is significant, as last year there were still ice ages.
Yet the rewarding of Kim, the leader of our country with nuclear weapons for years, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced on Monday, and on Friday will be the most-attended Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those participating in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been raped and has become the world’s leading expert in their field.
Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a karmic byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, was also considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there will be 331 nominees this year.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn’t be offended if he got the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him in the White House whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone agrees, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a win for the whole world, the president continued referring to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are some things that make Trump’s Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often paid tribute to the individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multifaceted world order – precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, the award was won by three American politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Trump’s reward would require a complete ideological translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire alert in tunnel: Drivers behaved like traffic jams and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic jam on the first floor of Lohja took place on 8 September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was interrupted due to the announcement in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it was discovered that these were system paths, the fire department sought to normalize the traffic.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Centre said that it cannot be opened, because there are drivers on the road and they are driving how it hurts, firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told STT at the time.
At that time, the motorway was off to drive in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others are often followed up, says Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Traffic Safety.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must only stop for a compelling reason.
Traffic safety reminds us that, in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to leave to jeopardise traffic with emergency solutions.
Alert vehicles shall always be allowed to pass as unimpeded as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is particularly prohibited, as well as making a u-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions apply also to tunnels where, in addition to always having to turn on the headlights.
It is also forbidden to stop without a compelling reason, as of course parking too.
In the past, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake
The fans of the inland vessel M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on the ship to continue their victory celebration, even though the ship had stuck on its wing at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrje, who was the ship’s captain at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was on his way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, left the track late on Saturday night and got caught at the bottom of the Vanajaveda in Aka.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt by friends.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on the boat until the morning, but of course it was wiser to send them home by firefighters by train to the port and by bus, Syrje told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in Ilves’ 4-3 victory.
According to Syrja, Saturday’s hammer was due to the fact that the surface of the water in Vanajavet was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjän, navigation was also made difficult by the fact that the nearest road mark was covered in log debris, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear on a dark night.
No more mention of a collision.
The event took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalme, shortly after the shipping line had crossed the highway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama in the case, according to Syrja, because the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more notable collision.
According to Syrja, being stuck to the bottom has not caused leaks or heaviness on the ship, and with this view, cruises on the ship will continue normally.
The diver went to check the ship's condition on Saturday morning before the ship was pulled off from the low hatch.
For the sake of certainty, we are still going to the shipyard to check that no damage has been caused, says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise to M/S Tampere, which is scheduled for next weekend, can be managed in a suitable manner.
According to him, the cruise period of the ship will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue agency received an alert on Saturday night after just half past 12 o'clock.
In the port of Viiala, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Firefighter Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather harsh wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue agency announced after three o’clock on Sunday night that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers were transported by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been rebuilt in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s nominee accused of harassment and smearing may miss top office
Brett Kavanaugh, the U.S. Supreme Court Justice, may well miss the post he is seeking, says Mika Aaltola, the program director at the Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and unwarranted conduct during their studies.
According to Aalto, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up running for office with someone else.
From time to time, it has happened in the United States that the Presidential candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the referee usually withdraws himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has managed to keep his face.
Appointment would rain on Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to rain down on the Democratic Party in the upcoming congressional midterm elections.
It would raise the voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
This is not an opportunity for every presidential term, as in the United States, the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have abandoned their own pension application at the age of about 70-80.
Some Republicans have expressed doubts about the nomination.
U.S. Supreme Court nominees are normally given background examinations, says Aaltola.
While Trump has only set a week’s deadline for the FBI’s additional investigation, Aaltola says it can still bring out something significant.
Yes, it may.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inadequacy for office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority vote of 51-49 in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators believe Kavanaugh's nomination is suspicious.
The most embarrassing would be that the nomination would be taken to a vote and the Republicans would be lost.
Woman Identifies Salisbury Suspect as Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she has identified a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
On the basis of the photos, the woman said that it was a military interview with Anatoli Tshep, who works at the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said they had previously revealed another man suspected of poisoning Chepig.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men’s current identities were covert identities.
A BBC group traveled to the Far East near the Russian-Chinese border village where Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified images published by young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from photographs of a British policeman who appeared as Ruslan Boshirov himself today.
Russians are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a Novishok nerve agent in March.
Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga was awarded the Medal of Honor for the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU link.
The men suspected of poisoning told Russian TV earlier in September that they had been in Salisbury as tourists in an interview.
The Elderly as Throwing Bags in the War Reformation
Now there is a vivid example of what the Sipilä government defines as the limit of change for war reform in practice.
Vaala’s military services are produced by the municipality of Oulunkaari, where Attendo’s former regional director has been appointed as the Head of Health Services in 2016.
The leaders of the municipal council warn the council of the change limiter.
If war expenditures rise now, the state aid of the municipality will be cut in the future.
The city’s central decision-makers were terrified, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care that would end the health centre’s annual department of institutional care and a small unit of memory patients.
Home care would be added, which means that the elderly living in the outskirts of Vaala will have their ribs from their roots to be treated "at home" next to the health centre.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left of the sector did not swallow bad preparations, but organized a good public gathering, which was attended by many relatives, caregivers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented the sote county preparation with diodes, how the elderly are treated in the municipality of Vaala already at the moment most at home in the whole of North-Pohjanmaa.
Carina Läntinen, a neighbouring commissioner, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it again lifted the Oulunkaari preparers to their back legs.
The War makers do not write on any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty-handedly for the residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers only talk about the service bills, but they do not tell you what levels of care it will receive or what staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until escort treatment.
Without a nurse?
The health centre’s facilities are closed because there is no doctor’s appointment at night.
Attendo will also refer to the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the field shows how central officials rotate the delegates with inadequate information and the delegates are punctuated back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Central Party will empty the inhabitants of Vaala, because those who are left unsafe to live there voluntarily, if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was there a single election statement in the city that the entire country was considered inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people showed their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe’s largest mosques.
Hundreds of people had already gathered on the banks of the Rhine in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, he read in the banners of the protesters, and slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan’s visit on Thursday, several demonstrations have taken place and security measures have been tight.
Around 10,000 people were expected to protest on the streets of Cologne in advance, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan’s supporters had also gathered in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and said it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey’s 2016 coup d’état.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep disagreements between the countries on human rights issues, among other things.
Review surrounds the visit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Both the mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan’s visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, and subjugated.
For Erdogan, all that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of Erdogan’s Germany journey in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkic.
Three counts of journalist's murder in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police suspect Kuciak's investigations into the murders.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of carrots on Sunday in scattered areas
Due to the printing error, Karjalainen will also have to post unaddressed on Sundays.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in scattered establishments where distribution in collective boxes is required from external memory.
The situation was the same for the magazine on Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Postitus puts extra newspaper stamps in the province.
The magazines of other Finnish subscribers will be posted separately only on Monday labeled.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala in his upcoming talk show.
Vesa is in the studio to tell of her upcoming space journey, which she booked from Virgin Galactica as early as 2010.
The price was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>151,000, which was needed to be paid in bank loans.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year after year.
Now, it seems that after the unfortunate, unfortunate, and even fatally demanding trial in 2014, things are on the line.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin later this year or not later than next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that her journey will take place about a year after her first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and is in weightless mode for 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut tells about his upcoming website.
At the same address, he also emphasizes his desire for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw it on the Star Trek television series.
Star Wars has been seen, and that's why the idea was stopped.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a terrible host.
Manchester City continued their undefeated stint in the Premier League, when it fell to their home field on Saturday with Brighton's 2-0 goal.
The goalkeepers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are the guarantors of the sixth victory of the reigning championship team.
Sterling was able to control the season's fourth hit from a close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute in the back of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own field to five when he joined Sterling as the defending champions of Brighton in the 65th minute.
The Argentine managed to place the 2-0 finishers on the penalty shootout easily.
With six wins and one draw, City, who started the season, leads the Valioliiga with a catch of 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who played less than one game, won only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh-round match on Saturday night.
Youth associations selected new decision makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term for the years 2019-2021 at their meeting, which ended on Sunday.
Anu Sivonen Ylä-Savo was elected president and Petra Mäkeläinen Hämee was elected vice president.
The Board of Directors was elected by 40 current members and 40 alternate members, Finnish Youth Associations reported on Sunday.
The Youth Assembly was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Assembly in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operational goals: We keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, as well as support volunteering and people with their own growth paths.
Lewis Hamilton praises Kimi Räikkö and amazes Ferrari: "Goes a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersun was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the end of the season.
In World Cup points, Hamilton leads the second team of Ferrari to Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he will move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would throw his gloves into the sink.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional. He's a fantastic driver.
“He remains one of my favourites and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his prototypes.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
“I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy,” Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday with the Russian competition.
Valtteri Bottas from Mercedek to the race starting at 2 p.m.

Football A-Youth SM Series Championship game became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top level of the football boys’ series ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before the start of the round at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship match were clear: FC Lahti Akademia has almost enough points against Vasa IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the last round, Ilvesen in the championship match must win PK-35 and hope for the Bayers to lose.
However, the Lahti championship was almost guaranteed before the start, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less batsman, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Akademie won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Bayers led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the vassals is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the men's Second C block.
Vasa IFK has played in the second quarter against the fall of the whole season.
In the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in the draw and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own draw against KuFu in Toivala in Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on the roof in Enos - according to the rescue agency, luck was involved

Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were lightly injured, the rescue agency said.
Luck was involved, the statement said.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after the rain.
The police went to the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new means of enquiry: Equipment procurement and recruitment already done, planning activities abroad will not be shivered
According to Supo chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence agency has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training staff.
When the information gaps come into force, the soup should be permanently added to the budget by around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
The security police (supo) facilities located on the Ratakadu in Helsinki are already preparing a full head for the entry into force of the inquiries.
Supo’s chief of staff, Antti Pelttari, tells West Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence mandates.
Serena Williams Surprises With Video In Which She Sings In Topless - Campaigning For Breast Cancer Awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back on track.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account where she sings only her hands in front of her breasts, according to the AFP news agency.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I voted for The Divinyls’ global hit to remind women to regularly do self-inspections,” Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in the inconvenience zone, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women regardless of skin color around the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it pervades many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was done in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
“She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to prioritize their health,” Williams says.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.

Corpela’s Smile Ends Today: This Is How It All Ends
All good ends in time.
Today, the national country drama takes place Korpela’s singing, which has been quite well-liked.
The third season of production has gone like hot rocks: last week the episode watched the first TV show of 722,000 Finns.
The main pages themselves have no practical meaning anymore, as Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkisen are not going to be a sequel to the series.
In the final period, Jaska and Mirku's relationship is again taken a glimpse of a leap forward, and Jaska's mother may be the first to guess what to expect.
Even between Anss and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events, they are directly romantic, but then Laiho appears again in the drawings.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
Yet no one can predict the fate of the Layah in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear incredible news.
The last will of the store is revealed, which brings the woman to tears.
After a week on Sunday evenings, the latest episodes of Sorjonen will continue.
Korpela's singing on TV1 today at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people will stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious, even if its symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear in the hives.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
Is it worth staying home?
According to prevention, the flu is contagious even when a person does not have symptoms.
The virus persists for a day before symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when your cough eases and your fever is gone, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Exercise should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the hall slows the recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, moisten your napkin and throw the junk into the trash.
A painful move, though?
If you have to leave home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the head area.
Then the fingers should not be placed on the nose or mouth, Poland says.
There is also limited use of a mask.
How, then, can infections be avoided?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Missi tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice hockey player and misses are often combined.
The same was true of Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland crown has been awarded to Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15 years old.
Alina’s mother is Finnish and her father is Russian.
My father's Russianness harassed Voronkova at school.
Mom and Dad moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was harassed because of my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina tells in the semi-finalist publication of the Miss Finland competition.
After high school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the Mississauga found new friends and the archives went on a roll.
When I was 15 years old, I thought I was an adult, but after that, I really wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurrin, who is known for the lines of the Pelicans.
After the SM League career, a hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
At the beginning of the date, the couple was almost a year apart, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband into the world.
If I got to the winning trio and it would give me a career, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, we have confidence working well and in a distance relationship, the good thing is that it stays on top of the full-time as a starting point, Alina said in May.
Continuing growth joyfully, death on our hips
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
However, you don’t want to give up anything.
We are looking for sustainable alternatives to continuous growth, but the theory of a reasonable economy also faces major problems.
The continuous growth of the economy has brought, over the course of a few generations, a standard of living for ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, of which only dreams could be dreamed.
However, the long-term surpass of the Earth’s bearing capacity and climate change are causing this market economy to collapse in a dangerous way.
Two men were stabbed on a Sunday night at the Kannelmäki Sitrator at four o’clock in the morning.
The man who was born in 1986 was seriously injured in woodworking and the second, born in 1968, was milder.
The older men have already been discharged from the hospital.
The police have arrested one person whose possible involvement in the wooden case is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect in the incident.
The incidents are investigated as a homicide attempt and a gross abuse.
IFK Mariehamn's important point - Intern coach made a mistake
IFK Mariehamn’s Simon Silverholt against Inter brought the team an important point in the men’s football league on Saturday.

Silvelholt managed to get through the right side and successfully lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the guest match, the Marian Haminas made the difference to two points at the Turun Palloseura at the site of the series trophy.
An important goal and a valuable point, Peter Lundberg, the head coach of Marianhamina, tightened.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not get caught up in the fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but fortunately, the Turkish goal brought us stronger into the game.
Inter's head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but the goal was again painful.
One defense mistake took the full scorer from us, Allen's scout.
Again, we were the best!

Lehterä appeared to be underpowered, the place of play is not yet sure
Jori Lehter’s strong underpower play emerged when his NHL team Philadelphia Flyers played their last practice game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehterää smashed Michael Rafflin twice in the goal.
In recent days, Lehterra has been on the show due to drug suspicions.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug group, where some suspects use drugs and some sales, for example.
The newspaper has denied that it has committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer magazine, said after the game that Lehterälä belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will take a place in the NHL.
In the training match, Lehterä was excellent according to Carchid.
In the second batch, Lehterä fought the reel by undermining himself, pulling the defender against him and feeding Rafflin in front of the goal.
For the second time, the team brought the goal to the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a visitation match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching team to decide whether he can join the NHL team.

I think I’m ready for the NHL,” Vaakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston’s Twitter account.

New Image Shows Change: World's Strongest Man Lost Tens of Pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, undergoes a remarkable transformation.
Eddie Hall has been hunting for the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time and determinedly.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories a day for food and weigh 200 kilocalories, according to the magazine Mirror.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted to doing damage to his body before winning the title.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for the victory of the World's Strongest Man by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if he won the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and was no longer seen at the April 2018 World's Strongest Man.
Recently, Hall posted a picture on Instagram where he poses his active career in a much leaner condition.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he trains aerobically five times a week today.
The on-site activities include snorkeling, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week at the gym.

Restaurant ship M/S Tampere slammed into the barn at Pyhäjärve - "Strengthening with stone"
The inland watercraft M/S Tampere drove for the boat late Friday night in Akaa on Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue agency received an alarm from a water traffic accident on Friday night after midnight.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted into the hull, and is firmly attached to its wing with a stone stone, described day-to-day firefighter Matti Willman.
The ship had 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue agency, injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland off the ship.
Now they are being transported by bus to Tampere, the deputy chief of staff Jari Nieminen told STT at one o’clock at night.
At the port of Viiala, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off the route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police are investigating the cause of the incident.
Firefighter Matti Willman said last night that the conditions on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and rather harsh wind.
According to the rescue agency, the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship doesn't seem to leak.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now an inland watercraft serving as a restaurant ship, with a maximum permissible passenger capacity of 180 persons.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been refitted in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenik
Boxer Robert Helenius’s evening match against Erkan Teper is shading money.
Ilta-Sanomat announced today that the manager of boxing Jaakko Helminen and the deputy judge Jussi Kokkila have submitted a challenge application, in which Heleniks will be charged unpaid manager fees for a total of just over 80,000 euros with interest on delays.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Heleniks on 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no other option.
This has been a clear mandate, and a lot of work has been done,” Kokkila told Ilta-Sanom.
Markus Sundman, the current manager of Helenius, sent a reply to Iltalehde, which tells about the events of the boxer’s vision.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenik in a financially distressing situation and promised to be able to organize matches and sponsorships for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay the rewards only in percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management activities of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed upon and would also have been unreasonable in the situation of Helenius, Sundman explains in his message.
There has never been a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the respondent, Helenius would have wanted to agree on a written distribution of income from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He said the proposal was bad and broke off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not even bother when dealing with Kokkila and Helmine.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Heleniks had received an "unidentified but large" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same allegations have been filed.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila’s post-mortem activities to be harsh, according to the correspondent.
Today, Helenius will meet Erkan Teperin, seventh in the IBF heavyweight competition in Stuttgart.
A hearty man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew that radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pällin had passed away for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-distance radio host and journalist, died of untreated liver cancer at the age of 83.
The announcement of the death of the conductor was published on Sunday in the Helsinki Sanom.
The announcement states that Pällin died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the fate of a known person.
He had previously left Facebook as if saying goodbye, Ile Vainio said.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli a multi-talented expert who has become a great journalist.
He remembers that Päll was considered a man who had quick hookers and funny things.
I got to know Erk when I was a little boy, when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a storekeeper.
I met Erik at the time.
He was at the time a spokesperson for Finnlevy and in various roles, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I went on to make albums as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the festivals doing things about artists.
He was always an expert and saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly to the skin of the interviewees.
He was a friendly man and a good reporter.
To many, he became known as Yle’s radio host, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper stories.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärje in addition to her journalistic work.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir’s albums.
Päll’s greatest passion, however, was radio work, in which he had a unique style.
He did radio work from the 1960s, and he became acquainted with numerous listeners on Yle Ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial period ended in May showed a profit of around 450 000 euros.
The union describes its economic situation as a "full turnaround", although the economy is, of course, burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict economics.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible by taking adaptation measures.
Careful planning and financial management of operations has been impacted throughout our organization, Kulmala said in a statement.
We have also been very successful in partner acquisitions, and in addition, the World Cup yield was maximum in the past competitive period.
However, in the future, the management of costs must be careful, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies are lying in the backyard of the hospital Please in the city on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where the injured survivors have been gathered to assess the injury and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to after-effects.
One of the people in the hospital area was the 52-year-old Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him the last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the army hospital in Palus was Dwi Haris, who has been injured in his back and arm.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter at the beginning of the shock.
The family was invited back to the wedding.
I probably got stuck under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
“I hope they are safe,” Haris told the AP news agency.
Small businesses are looted.
At the evacuation center, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tried to calm her fever.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
There is very little clean water.
Small shops are looted everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of the residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house was somehow upright, possible aftershocks could destroy it permanently and bury the inhabitants alone.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu’s prison fled after the prison walls collapsed.
The number of prisoners is known to be about 560, so there may be about 300.
Some of the prisoners in the Donggala prison have also fled, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became angry and set the prison on fire after the guards had forbidden them to leave in search of their relatives who were affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Please note that the airport has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
Among the first to land on the field was the Army C-130 transport aircraft, which brought auxiliary supplies.
Please note that commercial flights to the field are only allowed for a limited period.
The pilots have to land on the field without the help of the flight control, as the flight control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On Sunday night, a long rainy season will spread across the country, according to the Meteorological Institute.
The rain comes mostly in water, but in Central and North Lapland there is expected to be migrating or snow.
Last night’s frostbite does not recur, as temperatures remain higher under the cloud cover.
The night will be overcast with light rain. Low temperatures at night will be around noon.
In the very west you can temporarily visit the side of the ice, said daytime meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain falls in the eastern direction throughout the morning.
In the south and west there are peat or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon the temperatures always move up to the height of Oulu with steps of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more volatile.
There are wind and wave warnings in the marine areas.
The actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be varying weather forecasts for the typical autumn.
It’s going to be autumn, Ilka said.
The Miss Finland Final will not be seen on TV
From IL-TV you can watch the glamor and radiance of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
The entertainment editors of Evening Night draw a live broadcast on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from Billnäs’s pot.
The broadcast starts around 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned among the top ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at the Billnäs Cup in Raasepor.
Before the final, you will be able to follow the atmosphere from the spot on IL-TV live.
The live broadcast starts around 18.30 and continues for about an hour.
This year, many Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
In the jury they are represented by 1998 Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury are wellness entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jouni Kaupa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer Katja Birtunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he left for Mississauga.
Russian father Dimitri and Hungarian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter’s first moments at the end of the crown.
They swam to the crowd from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result started to get exciting, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Hungarian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career.
Alina was often told that when she was so beautiful, she should start a mission.
But he said he wanted to be a radio presenter.
It wasn’t until later that Alina was excited about the beauty contests.
The parents’ wish was for Alina to enter the university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and eventually Alina wanted to do a degree with him before the mississippies.
We asked him why he didn’t attend last year, but he wanted to finish it with him.
The parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults alike.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be present, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is working in Japan, and he didn’t get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship of young people lasts for a year.
Yes, that's the point!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
There has been such a long pause in the visits because of the speed of the missiles.
I'm sorry, even though I've got messages.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Once upon a time, my husband made a statement in which he proposed it as a person in the story I developed, says Espolean cartoon blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU translator in Brussels for economic and legal matters until after her fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've been enjoying myself as a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to my mind that what a big man would do when even the youngest child started to grow up.
Then in 2014 came the cartoon.
Pippipo says he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tint and Asterix since he was a child.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these scripts began to be born at that time, the situation changed.
I first made a few dozen manuscripts on the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled cartoonist, but I didn’t get her attracted until the summer of 2016 when I donated to Viivi using a drawing board.
His passion lasted as long as a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying for himself, laughs Pippipo, who tells him that the drawing was a great encouragement to him.
A drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
On paper, I didn’t even try to draw, Piippo tells me about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Manuscripts are constantly popping up in my mind, but I usually don’t prepare at the same time.
One three-screen stripper takes even more hours.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting a drawing is always the most difficult, because drawing is not the strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the current series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The people in the body ham are a carrot-cannabinoid mother with a salad-hair poodle.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the human body, man is what he eats.
The series’ ideas come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a bottle of wine, even if it’s a matter of nature.
Pippi tells her to read the series to her husband and children.
It’s such a wonderful feeling when you look at the cartoon you’ve drawn and realize that this is what I’ve done today.
There are enough challenges for the homeowner.

Indonesia earthquake: Air Commander sacrificed himself - didn't leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old flight attendant, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until a plane carrying hundreds of people was transported safely from the quake-ridden island.
The young man was in turn at the airport of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie in the city of Palu, when the earthquake struck on Friday.
When others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to be guided from the runway of the Batik Air passenger plane.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic controller was preaching and bursting.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal injuries.
Aung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The shock continued to intensify after the flight reached the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesia’s aviation authority has respected Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn pondered Europe's end to trade war: "You have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Throughout Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Olli Rehn, CEO of Yle, said that while the escalating tensions do not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also concerns the exports of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe has been very weak so far.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has also helped to pacify the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be at the forefront of a trade war.
You have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
“We have a rather unforeseen partner in the direction of Washington,” Yle said in an interview.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is the euro area’s third-largest economy, Italy, which is also one of the euro area’s most indebted countries and the entire western world.
The market reacted sharply yesterday Thursday evening to the Italian government’s presentation of a clearly deficit budget.
Next year’s deficit will be more than 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s lending volume is problem loans and more than ten per cent of unstructured loans.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak position and the country again seems to be exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would lead to Europe’s new economic crisis.
The second thing that affects Europe is Britain’s departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be okay.
The disputed distinction would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as CEO of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down after a year.
The discussion of his successor has begun.
Both Rehn’s and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen’s name has been confused in speeches.
It will probably not matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he will not comment on the matter further.
HS's super-popular Black Box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organized by the Helsinki Sanomis will continue again in the beginning of the week.
The other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre.
Tampere's show is sold out.
Tickets are sold at Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and filmmakers on stage will tell the story they have been preparing for a long time, which has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard of.
“There is a strange spy on the night in Helsinki, your impressive report on the other side of the globe and a talking story about a very current health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box producers.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsinki Sanomat has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and are often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the show.
The Black Box was awarded the Bonnier Prize for Journalist of the Year.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism as well as the journalist’s desire to get close to their readers.
The 2019 Spring Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show also visits Tampere and Turku.
The show you will see at that time has a different content than this autumn’s evenings.
The missing fungus was found thanks to an "unpredictable experiment"
Finnish police drone expertise is the world’s top: “We are being asked about training”
According to the director of the University of Matsuyama, the police can use the drone in addition to the search for the missing, for example, in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing fungal drone in Raahe in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the director of the University of Matsuyama Police, tweeted about the case and said, among other things, that “with unpredictable experimentation and effective education, we are also at the forefront of the world.”
The drone is quite a new setup and even newer in police missions.
Nowhere is there any statistic that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong notion that this is the case.
This has been achieved, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There’s a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to see the drone activity of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It's getting more common
Himberg reminds us that it is very important to find a missing person in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible.
As stated, in Rachel's case, the missing was found using a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they should be trained more.
Drones are already widely used in police missions, and their use will become widespread and increase in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for the missing, he said, the police can use drones, for example, in the accident or crime scene investigation and in certain intelligence missions.
For example, it is already necessary to visit an area a little further away, where there may be fears that there will be violence.
In this case, the drone can be used for pre-inquiry.
Karelia Rugby rose to 1st place
Karelia Rugby celebrated the 2nd division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensulais were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found the track and picked up the southern visitors 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd division championship knew Karjala Rugby's historic rise to its 1st division.
In the past, the club has played in 1st place, but at the time the Finnish rugby league activity was divided into two levels, the SM series and its multi-league 1 divisions.
The club is going to take the show, but it knows a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of at least twenty players must be increased to 25.
As a 1st division, it also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game breaks, so also the acquisition of funds must be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, who plays in the NHL, confirmed on Twitter that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked the super promise of Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round at number three in the summer booking event.
The striker joined Montreal's strength training team in late summer and has made strong headlines in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi immediately managed to score the goal in her first practice match.
The head coach Julien praised the Finnish man for taking the big development steps after arriving at the camp.
The NHL body series starts next week on Thursday night against Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership this week.
In an interview with HS, Nokia’s Chairman Risto Siilasmaa told Paranoide Optimist, in which he illuminates his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Olilla.
Ollila strongly disputed the charges, but earlier Nokia reports have also talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and innocence, which in part led to the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company’s growing risk-taking capacity and agility disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum also hosted a huge business event in Helsinki this week, which attracted the Finnish business community to Messukesku.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world rose to the stage.
Talking about good leadership was enough.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management companies, said that a good manager should dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods chain, who is known for its wide range of organic products, said the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that can't be just making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the book of introverts, said that the most successful leaders are studied to be humble.
They act calmly, silently, and determinedly.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, said that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the phase of the company’s lifecycle.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum was attended by 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
They had a potential for information.
A good leader requires a lot.
That’s why leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There was also Silasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in a friendly way.
However, they are hardly sure if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge from the outside.
Sara Chafak Arrived on a Stunning Red Carpet Directly from Los Angeles - Spending Most of Her Year Abroad
Model Sara Chafak reached the Missi Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The Miss Finland dress of 2012 also had a lace scarf.
I'll get another jet.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's in Los Angeles for a test shoot.
Among other things, he did commercials.
Working in the United States, he describes it as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to him, work has to be done more hard, because the model’s work is easy to find a substitute.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30,000 live art award in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won the 30,000-euro cultural prize in Kuopio on Saturday.
Award-winning Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors works in choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the council described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The award is given annually to a competent, exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
Danish police found a wanted Volvo in a major operation: "We can't tell where"
Extensive searches by the Danish police have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Juutinrauma and Ison-Belt bridges.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Sjallann was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere to Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached out to the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car you are looking for has been found.
We can’t yet tell where the car was found,” Henrik Storm told Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo is not directly connected to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Ekstra Bladet told the police about the news conference on Saturday.
Director of Investigation J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov was responsible for the operation.
He didn't want to tell you what the criminal's name was.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police don't tell if they've already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, ferry traffic restrictions have been lifted.
The police in Copenhagen also tracked the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the general public no longer has to worry about the threat to certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of disagreement - now the people vote on it in contested elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the Republic of North Macedonia would be named.
Until now, Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by approving the agreement.
The vote started online, at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, wished support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This is a change for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was officially known as the Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting enough whether the voter turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a yes vote would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament also has yet to accept the agreement.
The polling stations close at 9 p.m. Finnish time.
What a win!
Robert Helenius Erkan Teperin
Robert Helenius met late on Saturday night at Erkan Teper’s heavyweight professional cross-country skiing event in Germany.
The 34-year-old took the measurement of his 36-year-old German opponent at Waldenbuch in the Stuttgart Cup.
The main game of the evening was the Intercontinental heavyweight title game of the IBF League.
Its winner can be given the opportunity to take on tougher tasks on Saturday, whose economic importance is considerable.
Helenius finished the match in the eighth inning, beating Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" injured his opponent already in the third batch, when the German's nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were scheduled to be released in December 2015.
Then Teper called for an injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had smashed twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 games from his professional career and suffered two losses.
A clear favourite, Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton's order to win - difference to Vetteli already 50 points
The Formula One championship title came closer to being reassured, as Lewis Hamilton of Merced won the Russian Grand Prix and extended his world championship lead to Ferrari Sebastian Vetteli already 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position in the race, finished second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas took the lead in the semi-finals, but Mercedes ordered Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel finished third, Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was fifth in the final.
Two men raped a hairdresser in Joensuu - were caught off the block
Two men were beaten and kicked by a 31-year-old hairdresser in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
According to police, the men also stole the victim’s phone.
Police reached the suspects, i.e. a 35-year-old man and a 39-year-old man from Ilomant, to reach the block shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
Victim was injured who did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, will step down as chairman of the company’s board of directors.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for tweeting that he had secured funding to pull Tesla out of the stock market.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of 20 million euros if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach an agreement on oil with the United States
Time is running out in negotiations between the United States and Canada on the Free Trade Agreement on Oil.
The U.S. has set a backstop on Sunday, and negotiators from the countries have been debating closely over the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement with Canada has yet been reached.
The U.S. and Mexico want to put the deal into effect before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, resigns in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s participation in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans are to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow sufficient time for the U.S. Congress to assess it.
Neighbor thought the candles were set on fire in Kaakkur - fire department alerted
The burning candles in the apartment building in Kaakkur, Oulu, triggered a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen rescue units were alerted to the scene because of a possible layering incident.
On the spot, it was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna of the apartment building had appeared to the opposite house as a fire, which was why it had been reported to the emergency center.
There was no fire in the area.
Police Arrest 11 People After Honka-HJK Shooting - Scraping at Field and Metro Station
Police arrested eleven people after a men's football league Honka-HJK match in Espoo on Saturday, West New Zealand Police Department Crime Commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The unintentional reason was to protect against crime and harassment.
The arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
I’ve been told by the Evening Sermons before.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final eclipse, a large crowd of spectators marched into the field from the viewpoint reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to tensions and fistfights between the supporters of the teams.
In order to end the situation, among other things, a cavalry officer was needed.
In addition to the field, smash-ups took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn’t there, but what I saw from the pictures, so the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the rupture that took place on the field.
As a result of the incidents, no crime has been reported.
Table stone eclipsed butterflying in its SE season at the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims in the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the World Cup 3/7 competitions in the Netherlands.
The races will be swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS’s Table Rock shook Finland’s record in the 50-metre butterfly race, where he was second in the early stages at 22.82.
Previously, in September, Pöytäkivi swims in Helsinki for the SE-time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus in Espoloa, was 24.68 in butterfly design.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was 50 meters in the beginning of the sixth in time 30.48 and advanced to the final.
At the start of the two-hundred-meter mixing, Laukkanen was 2.14.25 in the 15th time.
Students play a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects its visuality
The ancient tragedies are rare on the Finnish stage.
For example, the last ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, was seen at the National Theatre in 1988.
Now the Theatre School brought to the tour starting with the National Theatre the only surviving theatre trilogy of antiquity, Aiskhylosen Oresteia.
In the Lavat auki! projects, which began in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre School work together with a professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as well as the first.
In April, Oreste received his international first night in Berlin.
Roiha's agreement on Oresteia summarises the report of the end of the bloody Atreus family condemned to destruction and the birth of the rule of law to twenty minutes, particularly by compacting the choir parts.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur’s fine finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theatre’s side revealing performance highlights the reduced and bright stage thinking.
Its center is the dynamics between the actors who alternately break out of the choir, who play nominee roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double- and triple-printing roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra returning from the Trojan War are shown on the stage, unlike what was customary in the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize its loyalty to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, in the eyes of the viewer, a modern, text-faithful interpretation is created, which is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out the master stage from the acting students as a close group, directly as one organism, a rhythmic group.
Particularly in the choir pieces, actors who are notably inclined to expressive, sculptural group formations can access their rights barely, only by decorating a white forearm, on stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues at the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer to manufacture its first hydropower loader
The novelty is emerging in Europe thanks in particular to the cooperation agreement concluded with Hyinda and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the IAA Utility Vehicle Show in Hannover, Hyundai will deliver a new model of a thousand cars for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
With the introduction of a fuel cell truck, Hyundai will continue the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this quality, the world’s first project, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the gasoline network, Hyundai Motor Vice President In Cheol Lee said in a statement.
Snakes snatch on several occasions in Kajaani
A little over 30-year-old man raped three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first beat a man inside a restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the place.
Outside, he would throw another man into the ground, and when the third man was in the situation, the perpetrator still beat him.
The police arrested the perpetrator.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another policeman in the leg.
The man also threatened police with harassment and murder.
The man took the pipe to calm down.
The case is being investigated in three cases of abuse and in violent opposition to the official.
In the centre of Kajaani, there was another case of abuse on Saturday morning.
The victim was tortured by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old Kayanite man struck a victim.
A little later, another man dropped him to the ground, and the man who had beaten him before still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the perpetrators away from the victim and the police were called.
However, they were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask eyewitnesses of the event to contact the police of Kajaani by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at researchta.kainu<0x40>poliisi.fi.
Long-range radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-time journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio presenter Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he told on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going now.
Even the doctor has said it, I live day after day, he commented on his situation to Iltaleh a month ago.
The safety of the aunts and uncles must be ensured
I first received a newspaper salary in 1984.
When these year-olds are surprised by something, it’s usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little angry for a moment.
I also spoke to Erika Käärä, a work environment expert of the Trade Union of Service Sectors (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers are saying otherwise.
Only cases that have been clearly proven to be serious are reported to the police and many of the real situation of violence remains unreported.
"Corporations have an obligation to keep their situation close to the job security law, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect their data at all," he said.
Mental injuries do not end in statistics.
In situations of violence, it has always been a problem that they do not always result in physical injuries.
Mental trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threat must be considered violence - even if there is no access to it.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if the real thing doesn’t happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, the media also saw quite a big slump in its impact on the safety of the sellers.
"At the time, many employers organized security services at least for night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähähära said.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this generates a new negative trend.
When the disturbances were well-managed for the purpose of the guard, the idea arose that the guard was unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
A slight misdemeanor is a proprietary crime, and it is understandable that the abused seller does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives in close proximity to the trade.
However, according to the sub-paragraph of the Act of 2011, minor ill-treatment becomes subject to prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should be charged.
If the court put a few criminals in jail, and a sentence from there for the severity of the sentence, the manners would be cleaned up.
A society in which the food trade must be open almost night and day in small towns, must ensure the safety of the trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg reported to the Misses before the live broadcast began - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crown of Missi this year will not be seen in the traditional way on TV, but the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, the host of NHL and KHL studios Viasat and Viaplay.
Backstage and the red carpet are run by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio informed the guests and media representatives who arrived at the venue about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula a heartfelt applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this one of our smugglers, Sohlberg glowed at his colleagues as they rushed the audience.
The leading races are followed by many of the previous years of Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg slammed his eyes toward Saro.
More likely, Sohlberg referred with his throw to the just-distinguished Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although at first seemed confused.
For the first time, he spoke about his separation in the weekly newspaper Ilta-Sanomien.
Mississauga said she did not want to open the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, as it is a matter between her and Roope Salmisen.
He said that he’s not in a hurry for a new relationship, but he’s going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things, and especially on living my own life alone, said Sara Sieppi.
The marriage status of Harjula came to light even later, when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The trio laughed at the mosquito.
Iroha was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi sneezed.
Baseman Tortured Bonded Spouse by Cutting, Burning and Feeding Strong Sauce
A 34-year-old man living in Kokkola has been sentenced to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his extraterrestrial zone.
The criminal offences included belts, cables and ties.
The court found these items to be lost to the state.
Ranki's case involved a suspect in serious rape.
However, the district court rejected this charge.
The cause of the attack was four abuses, gross abuse, coercion, illegal threat, freedom conflict, gross freedom conflict and two damages.
The crimes took place between March 26th and May 24th last year.
At the end of the last acts, the man was arrested and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday last week, the District Court of the Northern Territory handed down its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
There is no evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two serious violations of freedom and aggravated rape on 22 May.
However, the court rejected these accusations indefinitely.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public statement of the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his wife with violence, threats and coercion in situations where she had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, ate a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In his judgment, the court ordered the state to lose its criminal equipment: belt and cable, tie ties, bath belt, knife and water purifier.
Four Witness
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the conviction that a large part of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The 34-year-old will have to pay compensation for pain, tear, suffering and temporary damage of a total of 5800 euros.
He hardly has that money, since the convicted man already has his old debts in recovery.
The prison sentence is not a man's first.
The evening newspaper does not mention the name of the convicted person for the purpose of protecting the victim's privacy.
A recent district judgement is not legally binding when it comes to writing this.
Europe with four points ahead of the Ryder Cup
European golfers on Saturday captured their lead in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Paris Ryder Cup with 10-6 points, while there are still 12 doubles to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four four four-ball matches starting on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-ball game, the wins were tied 2-2.
Europe’s leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four pairs of matches on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had ever met.
On Sunday, the couple is looking for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans have ever made it to this one but three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the severe disruption of its supporters in the Honka match: "Ve<0xC4><0x8D>ivo do not belong to football"
On Sunday, HJK published a bulletin condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters in a Saturday’s FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologise for the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, around 50 HJK supporters ran into the field and some seemed to try to challenge Hong's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers did not calm down the situation, but needed policemen and also cavalry officers.
HJK said in a statement that the team’s players and staff were shocked by the incident.
The post-match events are not in line with the values of the traditional 111-year-olds.
“We strongly discontinue any action that jeopardizes the safety of match events,” the statement said.
HJK promises to help authorities and organisers of the event to find out about safety threats and to eliminate mild phenomena.
Supporting culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
In every way, we support positive, joyful and encouraging actions at the football stadiums.
"The power is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino Inventor Flys in Drone Car - How to Avoid Traffic Crashes
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and a kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group in the world that vows to invent a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, the man has used much of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he flew with his device at a height of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will arouse positive reactions.
This was only a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts that tomorrow’s work-fighting activities will be visible in childcare and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the bans on overtime and shifts, which will begin tomorrow, will be particularly visible in social and health services and day care for children, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL.
The effects will be extensive, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff on the spot.
Everyone has to think about the way they look for their child.
It is now the job of the employer to make sure that the services are playing and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were in overtime and shift bans due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that staff have not been hired, but that employees have stayed in overtime or switched shifts.
This is not yet a labor struggle.
In terms of occupational safety, it is quite normal for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government’s intentions to ease the resignation protection of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Manager for Municipal Workers, does not pre-assess the impact of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, even though services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have done the preparations that can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health action and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary greatly by industry, region and employer,” Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week, experience was gained from the three-day activities of the local and primary care association Super and the social and health trade union Tehyn, among others.
Their impacts were rather small.
JHL’s ban on overtime and shifts applies, among other things, to workers in municipalities, churches, the state and the private social and health sector.
For example, family day caregivers are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100,000 JHL members are involved in the labour struggle.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other labour struggles if preparations for the dismissal law continue.
The government should now admit that here it is running against the wall and hard.
Jalosen believes that both the ay movement and the government must come up against it.
It is strange here that the hard ones are already in the pipeline, even though the presentation has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Ride is born with the power of children and adults - in the gymnasiums of the show we study the movements of the squirrel and the seahorse
In other venues, the collective “Suri Koralliriutta” got its first evening last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in the Kanneltalos.
Like the group’s previous works, The Great Coral is a work that will be built from beginning to end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer frontier presentation is also being built, which refreshes and crystallizes the observations made in the initial exercises.
There’s also plenty of magic in theaters for children’s playlists.
The child’s point of view has already been taken into account during the preparatory phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s show, but a show that adults and children make in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and insights on how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into practice and play together is also a glimpse of the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of the sadabalette, gymnastics, and nature-themed awareness, but ultimately it is shaped in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with an introduction to the movement of coral and coral reef living animals and fish.
In six different gymnastics circles, among other things, we learn the gestures of a squirrel and a seahorse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be made, where music, lights and shiny paintings and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the great coral reef there are both divers who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being looked at.
There are also coral reefs.
The sightings and observations directed towards many make the performance dense and life-giving.
Whether it be the landscape of an organism, an organism that looks at the landscape, and another organism that looks at the organism or the landscape - and all at the same time.
It doesn’t seem difficult for children at all.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the limit of thinking and acting, which when the group is made up of both children and adults, is challenging.
On the other hand, the participation of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals is held at the Sitrator.
Destructions beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it may be difficult to understand the importance of exercising one’s own compassion no longer in the face of the prospects of destruction.
In other places, he has built his work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, whose wonder and play is fraught with space.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm happy that I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid
Children and young people today are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess with their lives because of gossip and sex, because others say they do too.
I was horrified when my boyfriend told me he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister from a "boyfriend" on the weekend.
When he came to pick up his drunk sister, she told him about her sex experiences that night.
I could not imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that it is not allowed to touch the headlines and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that the children of today will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup on their faces and revealing clothes on their faces.
Snapchat is used to capture and send images that reveal in the evening.
It’s even harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
I was a child for many years and didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities told the head of state that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to the interview Ilkka Kanerva, the protection police and the defense forces visited to inform the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation of Airiston Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reported.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ylle, Chairman of the Committee on Defence Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the defense forces and the security police visited the defense and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered an economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else, Kanerva commented in Yle’s interview.
According to Yle, there has been no evidence of a connection with national security to date of the material seized, but the investigation is only underway.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, says one of the interviewees from Yle.
A week ago, extensive home searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the Evening Newspaper compiled a case that deals with allegations both for and against.
Video: Dream Paint Saved Liverpool Lost Series
Liverpool's 100 percent start to the Premier League came to an end, but it was still a happier team to play 1–1 at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran for a 1-0 guest win.
At the time, Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Valioliiga that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager J<0xC3><0xBB>rgen Klopp arrived at the same time ideally in West London.
The Reds had started the Valioliiga with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate on his own at the end of the field.
Chelsea, in turn, had less than Wednesday’s fine league cup guest win at Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the bench to finish the match with a stunning one-shot.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first bowled in small mode with threesome Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard jumping forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pen.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombarded the entire left leg from there to the back of the bet.
Pool's brass batter Alisson was a little slow in his fight and only got his fingertips into the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the losing position slightly unfair, as almost immediately behind Antonio Rüdiger was kicking Mo Salah’s lead.
In the second period, Chelsea coach Kepa also got into real action.
The bass guard quickly reacted to Sadio Mané’s bet and pushed the ball from the bottom of the bat as a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson zeroed in on the Hazard crossing.
The guests' best spot came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino.
However, the Brass star’s bust was directed towards teammate David Luisi, who saved the hosts’ lead.
Nor did it last until the 89th minute, when alternate Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to the top of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still in the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also closely involved in the championship, two points behind the top.
In the clock shift debate the potatoes are deep
I remember a decade ago when a newspaper asked different Finnish influencers what divides the people of Finland.
Juice Witchesen’s answer was the only one left in mind: Nen-käste.
Some of them have a nape and some don’t.
They can be found anywhere, and here was one of them.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock movement is being abandoned.
A lot of people agree that changing watches twice a year has been a fool’s business and has caused a lot of problems.
Ultimately, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing to do now is to decide what time it will end up in: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This can also be said by the people on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday, October 12.
There is a lot of debate at the coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
The defenders of winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people’s well-being and the defenders of summer time with the effect of evening light on people’s outdoor desire and thus on well-being.
Both sides have a strong supporter and a good argument.
According to studies, morning light rhythmizes a person’s day and gives them freshness.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn yards.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated to its hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but if we're in the North Pole of the Earth, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many people anyway.
A typical debate on the subject is that one's own view is driven and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other party are not exactly listened to, because the most important thing is how it feels.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on it, it is somewhat in vain to try to turn the other’s head.
That's where the rut gets lost.
The subject is very easy to argue, because it does not require a great deal of effort and a sense of humor is enough to justify it.
Controversy over counter-attacks is usually more sharply and equally fruitless.
It’s a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but it doesn’t fit.
And always it also offers a suitable scapegoat, if life feels awkward.
Josba fought for the perfect guest victory
Josba's first guest-game in the Salibandy Divar produced three full-seater points against Nurmon Jymya.
Josba left Seinäjoki for the home trip with a happy 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led the goal at the start of the third streak, but Josba picked up compositions and recycled the men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Etu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored 6-5 wins.
In the ice rink of both teams, decisive minutes were played in the draw.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2<0x2B>1).
The second chain was also very strong when Teemu Tukhanen (1<0x2B>1), Jere Kartinen (1<0x2B>0) and Jere Kettunen (1<0x2B>0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1<0x2B>0) also played in the second-place chain at the time of her birth.
Josball has six points after three consecutive rounds.
The next meeting will be at O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
200th Anniversary Celebration in Enon Church on Sunday
The 200th Anniversary of Eno Church is celebrated on Sunday in a very sad atmosphere.
The acceleration of the church a week ago was a shock.
The church of Eno was also guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Although no one would like that, the church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other associations in the world.
The family reunion starts at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we move to the churchyard at the Karelian holding table.
There are all sorts of things on the program, both inside and outside.
You can visit the church building, for example, under the guidance of Ari Räsäsen, who has retired for 37 years as mayor of the church.
The celebration of the Church’s birth also marks the end of one era.
Already decommissioned, the church house, built in 1982, will open its doors for the last time today.
We are now in opposition rooms in the former municipal building, says the chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been in a healthy place for the past 200 years.
Elon Musk Rejects Tesla's Speech from Head of Government - Settlement Charges for $40 Million
Tesla and Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, have reached an agreement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees the U.S. securities market.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined because of the company he founded.
Musk will continue as Tesla’s CEO.
Instead, Musk is forced to resign as Tesla’s chairman of the board for three years.
The company must hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk will also be subject to tighter controls.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and monitor Musk’s communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay $20 million (about 17 million euros) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and damage to Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peik, director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk tweeted that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company’s finances are secured.
The tweet temporarily increased Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the deal with other management or potential funders.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it is challenging the company and Musk’s lawsuits.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running the stock exchanges.
The SEC’s challenge scared investors, and Tesla’s stock went down sharply.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami kill more than 800 people
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country’s disaster agency.
The death toll is still expected to rise, as the destruction is under way.
According to Vice President Yusuf Kalla, the final figure could rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake lifted a tsunami that struck the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known dead are from Palu, at least so far.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area of Donggala near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for Ruined Aid
The Indonesian army has been alerted to rescue workers in search of victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the destruction zone today, called on the soldiers to continue their rescue operations without exhausting them day and night.
One of the centres of the rescue work is the hotel in Palus, which is believed to still have 50-60 people in the ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said that one of the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel favored by business travelers was excavated alive at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy grinding equipment would be quickly needed in the area of shock and tsunami.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer in a Facebook group.
The phone numbers of politicians leaked to the hands of rioters in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contacts were leaked due to deficiencies in the app’s encryption.
Disruptions included access to ministerial telephone numbers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party meeting in the government.
For example, the Minister of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who drives Brexit, have been harassed.
Several MPs have received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the app, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app of the Annual Meeting of the Conservative Party.
The public accessed the profiles using the policy’s email address, which was easily accessible online.
The profile user has access to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change the profile picture of Boris Johnson for a moment into a pornographic image and the title was offensive.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to the image of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people’s profiles at these email addresses.
Then the login can view the profile person’s contact details and send messages on behalf of the profile person.
The meeting app made the phone number of every reporter, politician and participant public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative Party spokesperson apologised for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British ICO supports data leaks.
The app was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Suomi audience has a large group of pounding Poles every week
The eye-catching viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi.
The fast-growing U.S. format, The Wall, landed the Finnish version for Nelos last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasosen has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities of shooting were exceptional, as the format of the large 12-metre-high game walls required space from the space.
During the initial period, the program’s studio audience was highlighted on social media, which was acted in Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate as to whether the Polish people sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game they are playing in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, the head of the Quartet’s domestic programmes, will explain the matter to Iltaleh.
He says that the studio audience is close to the players, other Finnish, non-Finnish living in Poland, as well as Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international clutterers in Finnish production, as well as the generals of The Wall episodes depicted in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who visit the descriptions of the different programs, according to Fingers.
He reminds us that watching a game in itself is not so difficult even if you don’t understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, there are interpreters in the guest studio who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events for the studio director all the time as a simultaneous interpretation.
And the studio director then guides the audience and tells them what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going to be, says Finger.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was produced in domestic production in the past.
David Hasselhoff took part in the filming of Talent Finland a few years ago in Finland.
Simultaneous interpretation came to him all the time, and he knew everything that was spoken in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of the finger.
Japan's South Korean Typhoon Moves to Main Islands - Authorities Warn of Earthquakes and Floods
Authorities are also warning of possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Taifuni Tram, but major injuries have been avoided, and there is no information on the deaths so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains have been stopped due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka near half a day in Finnish time.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the storm trail, but there is also a promise of heavy winds and rain.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to meteorologists, Trami torments Japan until Monday.
The sky of the axes was darker.
The early days of the donkeys have been bad.
The sky was already almost dark when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) on Saturday at their home field for Vaasa Sport.
The players now have five consecutive losses, and a total of two points from six rounds.
No defender of the Axes or player of the two lower chains has scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
You were playing against the public at the time when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to be careful, because we played so badly.
Especially the performance of the second batch was embarrassingly bad, Jarno Kärki told Aessi about the effects of 1<0x2B>2.
The sport, of course, enjoyed it.
The team had a down game on Friday, so it would have been expected to make it visible.
It may have been, but I couldn’t take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the day continued to increase.
The mother of the bread day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the number of audiences watching the event in the big hall.
Somehow he thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, at the same time as Bread Day, the SM competitions of Traktorikynnö were held, so perhaps in the expectation that the audience might even drop slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were closed just before 10 o’clock, the sellers said that the products were out of stock, more than 500 doses were sold, and even in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6000, Hyvärinen reports later in the afternoon.
In the morning and at five in the afternoon, there was a lot of program for families with children, which seems to attract them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sellers also fly to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred reporters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at their baker.
PIrkko Hyvärinen, the mother of the day, admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemen's beautiful bread won the popular vote.
There were 11 different types of bread in the children’s competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the roast bread competition, spent the day at the March cake shop.
7 x the most beautiful lights - here you can recognize a good lamp
Wake up the space, create the right atmosphere for the interior, and read the book without tired eyes.
It is worth betting on good lighting.
We have gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Director of Sales and Marketing at Innolux.
Do a favor for your eyes
The importance of lighting is growing, the more years are behind it.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people experience with age, as the accuracy of vision decreases and more and more blurred vision suffers.
As parents, the need for light is growing.
A 60-year-old needs three times more light than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
Good lighting gives enough light, but not dazzling, Jokiniemi tip.
Create beauty around you.
Beautiful interior design can only be achieved with the right lighting solutions.
The interior designer of this moment can afford to choose.
It is popular with a japanese style that combines liveliness, Scandinavianness and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, a modern and playful retro style inspired by the 1970s, with strong colors, metal tones or ice cream colors, has risen to buffalo.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as other home decors.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Demonstrate your personality
On the other hand, more investment is being made in the home now than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want your own home to be customized, even a brave lighter with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, whose origins and designers are known.
So we are very design conscious, says Jokiniemi.
At home, not necessarily to acquire the latest trend light, but a timeless classic, for which has been saved many years.
Some kind of timeless, bold and elegant classics hold their surfaces from year to year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and bye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoo and attacker Brendan O'Donnell are splitting up.
The Canadian striker played a total of three Liga matches in the orange box with no power points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year deal, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
In the last season, the 26-year-old striker played in the KHL in the Kunlund Red Star ranks and in the KHL farm in the VHL in the KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no information about O'Donnell's new company yet.
Gamer wants to show an example in recycling - goods are going to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Gamers now recycle not only the games but also the packaging materials.
The products of our customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in packages imported from importers.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes ten times, as long as the package is in a condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula of Oulun Gamer.
As a soft material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Plastic cups should be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also going to move on to recycling materials in envelopes.
The company also wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling does not cause extra effort.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, cartons are reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Gamemaker’s activities, as in addition to new products, the store’s main product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying Every Fashionable Shirt: One and the Same Shirt Works in Every Outfit
Classical clothing works from season to season in an outfit other than an outfit.
With their versatility, they create the basis for a good wardrobe, because it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics inexpensively.
In autumn, the most used classics of the wardrobe are high quality knitting.
This category also includes black polo.
A black knit made of natural material with semi-finished products cannot be mistaken.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, waistcoats and jeans, and it can create both a restrained outfit and a scarf style around it.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dresser and a classic refined style guitar.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look comes from gold-brown and wide-breasted spider-skin pants, black polo shirts and grey ankle boots.
The classic pool tones, together with other classics, blue-green scotch skirts and wine-red loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated set of living spaces.
Combine it with casual fashionable garments: jeans, high-heeled boots and thick pantyhose.
Young and sleek!
The sabotage activity of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation’s foreign intelligence service SVR or the GRU military intelligence service would have given up this course of action.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name derives from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya group: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet security service in the western countries of the KGB have prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says the KGB’s westbound archive manager Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for covert operations of the Bundeswehr, railways, forest guards and road workers for DRG groups.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints for roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated the Crimea from its homeland.
During the Cold War, agents hid in the countryside supplies packs of mines, explosives, lighters and media for sabotage groups.
In 1998, a KGB hideout was found in Switzerland, which was exploded when authorities injected it with a sewer.
Police raided four trucks in the province at night.
Police arrested four drunken riders in various parts of North Karelia on Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old Conti Bay man blew 1.57 promille.
He drove at half past four o’clock in the night at the beginning of the Kajaaninti, driving two passengers.
A 19-year-old local man, who was alone in the car, blew 1.54 miles, according to police, at the end of Polvijärvi Lake.
He didn't get any serious injuries on the way out.
A 20-year-old foreigner driving a car in the centre of Otokummu blew an alcometer of 1.33 miles.
The police suspect these male drivers of serious wheel intoxication and, in addition to the Polvijärvi driver, of jeopardizing traffic safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of <0xC3><0x96>llölänti and Hoikanti, a local 36-year-old man carrying a van blew 0.52 miles.
He's suspected of driving drunk.
The police are asking for observations on the logging at Turku railway station after midnight.
According to police, the man was abused in the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
Teko was recorded on the surveillance camera.
The suspects, wearing dark hair in dark pants and brown or beige jackets, left immediately after the trip in a dark farm car to the Ratapihankata bus station.

HPK holds Risk in its ranks for the end of the season, Lehtisen’s trial period ended
Mika Toivola, head of sports at Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (center) has played an important role for the team in starting, underpowering and defending the four-field.
Filip Riska, who played in the beginning of autumn, will continue the final season at Hämeenlinna HPK.
The success of Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the succession.
Filip has played an important role for us in the initiation, the underpower play and the defensive role of the four-field.
Although there is still something to be improved, it is good for the young team to stick to an experienced player like this, HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola said in a statement.
According to Hoivola, the value of the risk increases when playing in the ice hockey league fixtures.
Riska, a centre-back from St. Petersburg, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.
The striker Oskar Lehtinen, on the other hand, was left without an agreement after the trial period.
TODAY’S TODAY’S TWICE TWICE: A Kickstarter Has Been Left to Die
Beck Weathers wrote the book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man’s own experiences.
The movie of the evening is based on them.
Everest is getting its first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
The management of Baltasar Korm<0xC3><0xA1>kuri in 2015 tells about the survival instincts that have been processed in a fertile manner.
Tragedy has been filmed and documented in the past.
Real events are also going through in this case.
22 years ago, the world’s tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced tour managers: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and the air pressure, he lost his sight, so the conquest of the summit had to be omitted.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never came back.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm got up, he disappeared and could no longer return to the camp.
When the man was sought, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was left to die.
However, by a miracle, he still got on his feet and found others.
The worst-hit Weathers was thought to be still dying, and once again he was left to his own advantage.
It is clear that, contrary to different expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the climbers also began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall as Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer as Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the church of Eno.
Today, Eno’s 200-year-old church is celebrated in a church hall.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and the celebration of the year for Sundays was prepared for the celebration of the whole family.
The celebrations began at the church of Eno at 10 a.m. with the family, after which there has been an antique of the Karelian table at the church house of Eno.
The church was full.
There were 517 people in the family.
Eno’s church master Armi Iron Mountain was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to work, Iron Mountain (pictured) says.
The fire of the church of the acceleration danger has touched many, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary celebration of the church of Eno.
The church of Enon is now in Joensuu after the fire destroyed the church of the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran churches.
The wooden church of Acceleration Danger was completed in 1770.
In the morning, an agitation was held in danger of agitation, where the church destroyed by fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: Medican exudes power in Greece - Sea disappeared and street turned into river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm ravaged Greece from lunch on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicine, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region due to flooding, rather than a street.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, heavy winds caused heavy seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The mission urges you to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medicaan, brings heavy rains and even flood hazards.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, drugs only occur once or twice a year around the world, typically between September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The now-explosive storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and Europe.
There has also been concern in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate protection.
In the summer, areas destroyed by wildfires in the surrounding area of Athens will also remain under the storm.
In Greece, I also enjoyed my medicine last November.
You don't have to go to the sea now, flights still on their schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
The trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to fly over branches or other loose goods in a storm.
Such instructions have been distributed to a fair 3,500 people in Greece for a Finnish holiday weekend through sunbathing trips.
Instructions are needed, as even a terrifying storm of Zorbas has been predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in the bush up to 45 meters per second.
In the summer, heavy rains add to the heat.
All passengers travelling to Greece from Finland via Sunrise and Tui, who have reported their phone number, have been warned by the tour operators of a harsh wind by text message.
The sun and the heat still in the air
According to Inka Ikosen, a specialist in solar communications, the holiday destinations have been avoided from the very beginning on Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and boarded on a normal schedule.
Of course, we keep an eye on the situation all the time.
Security is ahead of us.
I supported the media journalist Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are constantly in touch with our local staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me early Saturday night.
There are currently a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands of Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos arrives on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had sunburned and the temperature hurt to 27 degrees, says Ikonen von Sonnenreisen.
Zorbaksen has been estimated to move on to the next Turkish rice, although slightly lightened.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked, for example, the number of Finns who have flown by Antalya Tui, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss are the exact same outfits in the Missi Final - this is how they react to the situation
As a media person and fitness coach, Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-breasted evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the market and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great outfit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress was also chosen by the narrator Shirly Karvinen.
The couple also noticed similar clothes and looked at the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry to get on the plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet runner in the Missifinals, and he talks about the leading stars coming to the scene.
Hussi has a fresh move behind him, because he moved from Kampi to Jätkäsaare on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own working room, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was great, I was only at the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress broke out, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected curious glances from pensioners
The lead singer and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Suomi final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio broadcasts and Love Island Suomi.
The rush has been enough even to the extent that Karvinen arrived in the final straight from Finnair’s flight.
I made up and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Dress change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he has pulled out his makeup among pensioners.
His preparations also attracted the attention of the passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his plague as a Finnish runner of Love Island.
He also said his experience has been staggering so far.
Karvinen says he visited the show's singles on Friday.
It's kind of raw.
They are people’s true emotions, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program’s singles.
How do I get over-the-top boots?
Three perfect exemplary modes
Classical clothing is a piece of clothing that works from season to season in an outfit other than an outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern individuals can fit in.
The generational boots that became the hottest of the autumn and winter seasons a few years ago have not gone anywhere.
According to its name, the upper boots above the knee repeat in style from year to season.
Looks like boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth a try, well - bravely.
In fact, over-the-top boots are actually suitable for any type of housing.
Whether it’s a jeans, lace, tulle or jersey, the boots’ simple leather or artificial leather cape works.
The long boots look good in the festive look as well as in the everyday wear.
Black over-the-shoulder boots are also well suited for comfortable fits.
Suitable for balancing the femininity of a pink, floral pleated neckline and a hemp, velvet knit.
A fresh but stylish autumn day dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-styled set of outfits comes from a long copper brown embroidery, over-the-top boots, spectacular earrings and a ninja bag.
While the super-generation boots have a certain level of sophistication, they are also perfectly suited for casual everyday wear along with a t-shirt, long shorts and trendy flagpole.
It's so easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the end of the year and take passengers with them, the city of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is set to launch traffic on a robotic bus.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical performance of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment explores how robotic cars can cope with the current road network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says transport manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars are fully automatic in the midst of other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger sitting in the car.
The vehicles constantly sensed their surroundings with several different sensors and assessed whether the road was free.
If not, they will interpret whether an obstacle has been detected to a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake,” says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4, which is responsible for the development of robotic transport.
Robotic cars run all autumn on three days of the week: Tuesdays from 1 to 3:30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 3 p.m. and Thursdays from 10 to 3 p.m.
The robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers with them.
Robotic vehicle stops can be identified by stop markings.
The safest way to get there is from stop number 1 at Otakaara.
Mokoma's bassist fell from the stage in the middle of a rope and was injured
The Mokoma group informs on its Facebook page about the surprising situation at Tampere Pakkahuone.
The band’s performance at Tampere’s Pakkahuone received a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell from the stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
The hamster's wrist was broken.
The band reports on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu got stuck yesterday in Pakkahuone from the stage in the last bite and broke his wrist.
We hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be handled by an alternate crew, the pages read.
Fans of Mokoman respond with concern to the photo update, where the bassist-Santtu sits plaster in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, there was quite a lot of concern about how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bones, fortunately, will improve over time.
A quiet and fast recovery for Santu and a good tour for the rest of the band plus the butterfly!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great show, but you promise to leave off such a strong drama in the future? writes one fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The East Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Refuge Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police officials said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and legality of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected for a hunting license and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, the holding permits for hunting weapons and the number of cartridges allowed for self-loading canals were checked.
According to police, 112 hunters were inspected during the check, and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
A 12-day fine was imposed on the hunter for illegal fishing.
In addition, the police blew up 133 drivers of the vehicle, two of whom are suspected of driving drunk.
In addition, the batches dealt with five traffic jams in the fine procedure, once by the police.
In conclusion, it can be said that hunters comply very well with the hunting permit.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone has checked the permits.”
The East Finland Police Department will continue the hunting control in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, it has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps to Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and there are representatives from the Immigration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Trade and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR first selects people who are particularly vulnerable to the condition.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-care families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people are chosen for the group of people coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some of the people do not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet NGOs working on the border between Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Head of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Referring to the quota increase
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement in the government to increase it.
The meeting has supported the quota increase, but the project has recently fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
This is the first visit by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees on the spot.
Former Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (co.) and Paula Risikko (co.) managed to move on to their new tasks before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 000 from the EU for each refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now let's go to the canvasses - no longer know, cry or laugh
Karjalainen announced last Saturday a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article came to the conclusion that in principle, the bill prohibits the holding of all animals as farm animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities which are not specifically permitted by the regulations of the ministries.
So everything else is in principle prohibited except for the animals mentioned in the regulation separately.
If the bill comes to an end, it means that in Western democracies we are rejecting the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that jeopardise the security or good practice of society.
In principle, we are now regulating the prohibition of any activity which is not specifically permitted by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation that approves it has been passed.
The government’s work in lawmaking has generally been weak.
If we now go on the road that basically everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know, cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act would require an update.
But this bill is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I would like it to adopt such a procedure as 'everything is prohibited, which is not permitted separately by law or regulation'.
I hope that there will be a sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell: The Four Most Trendy Skirts of Autumn
This autumn’s trend will come in snake bites.
It looks especially good on the skirts.
Combine a snake-like skirt with a pair of restrained tops, such as a polo or a regular t-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
This autumn silk is abundant and especially silk knit is one of the most trendy pieces of clothing of the season.
Combine a gorgeous silk skirt with a feminine top or relaxed knit as a pair.
With a silk skirt you can play more daringly and throw on your feet, for example, sneakers or trendy autumn cowboy boots.
No matter whether it is gray, brown or multi-tone, all square skirts now belong to every woman's must-have clothes.
Courageously combine different colors with each other and play with the table top also on the top of a special piece.
For example, the combination of squares and ball squares is beautiful.
Asymmetrical beads are a breeze of the lightness of the summer, which can be taken with you in the autumn.
The asymmetrical wig is both feminine and playful and is perfectly suited for both everyday and festive occasions.
Alexia baby, 3 months, crushes sweetly in Jere's arms
In the family photo of Karalahs, the attention comes to the cute three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells Kerava about the Authentic Day Home.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and former ice hockey chef Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family allowance in early July.
The couple’s first son Jax turned 2 years old in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held Martina Aitolehde as a trainer in Marbella, Spain, where the entire Karalahti family was involved.
Nanna posted on Instagram a picture of the Spanish atmosphere, where she poses for the entire Karalah family.
The children Jax and Alexia are in the arms of their parents.
Attention is drawn to the cute crushing baby Alexia, who rests on Jere's father's arms.
Thank you for this.
Grateful for kindness, forgiving, for the generosity and joy of people, writes Nanna Karalahti along with the family poster.
Nanna Karalahti and former ice hockey chef Jere Karalahti recently went to the kindergarten and opened a real-day home in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, Johannes Laine, a food expert, and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for the education party, are also involved in the company.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of day care.
Turkey urges to charge mobile phones in case of storm
The Zorba storm in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned seafarers, fishermen and farmers of the country’s west coast on Saturday about the storm in Greece, reports CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is said to be moving along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday urged citizens to charge their mobile phone before the storm and to ensure the functioning of the internet connection so that people can get up-to-date situation updates, according to the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been asked to stay at home and away from the windows and to move, for example, garden furniture away from the wind.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
The Red Weather Warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies organising Greek trips warned the Finns in Greece of the Zorba storm.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were invited to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago when I contacted, there was a lot of wind and it was raining.
The people were very calm, communication manager Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar even on Saturday night.
Even in the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received messages from the Finns in distress.
In several ports in Greece, the ships did not operate on Saturday, the local news agency Amna said.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions in air and shipping were expected.
Finnair was informed on Saturday that the weather situation will be actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the reason for Mercedes’ superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece in the time of the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth-placed and with his team-mate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen clearly left the Mercedes wheels.
Ferrar had a tough time in the previous race in Singapore.
We were asked what was the reason for the sudden drop in Mercedex’s drive.
They seem to be going faster than us - as simple as it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don’t know more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
From time to time, there was a rare delicacy for Sauber in the coming valley of Räikkönen.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrar in the first season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson was also ahead of the final season.
The 10th starting point for the Swedish Cup is the best in more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers were completely absent from driving, the result was still delicious for Sauber.
And perhaps an encouraging future for the R<0xC3><0xA5>ikköy?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the beginning, then the step forward has been a big one.
Next year is a different story, so let’s see.
It was there - Robert Helenius yelled at Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in the evening of Stuttgart was progressed in steady points.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he did not get a good hit.
Clearly more extensive Helenius controlled the match with his hard sets, which found well to arrive.
The Finnish was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth instalment, when Helenius slammed the left straight into Teper.
The blow was so severe that the cockroach in front of the home audience did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In a body interview, he first praised the good mood created by the public and his opponents.
Then, for a moment, he changed his language to Finnish.
Thank you to all the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We were taken with the belt today.
Helen was happy right after the game.
It was a huge win for Helen’s career.
There might be an opportunity to even enter the World Cup, Helenius commented to Iltaleh before the match.
The loss, on the other hand, could have ended the entire boxing race.
Of course it has come to mind.
There will be no more youth here, the 34-year-old Helenius admitted before taking the Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could double.
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice president calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to the country’s vice president, Yusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for those who have been trapped as well as those who have died in the worst-affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city and its neighbouring Dongga.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been seriously injured.
There are still people in the buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the cries of the people who have fallen into a trap, but the lack of razor equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and loot.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster area, electricity and communications are in many places.
Fuel reserves are also declining.
Miss Finland's hesitant response and long reflection caused laughter
A new Miss Finland is currently being selected in Billnäs Ruuk.
In the interview round, each Missifinalist was asked a question.
The finalists asked a question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikosken, 23, the hesitant response was sweet, but benevolent laughter in the audience.
The question posed to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book the Missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer well before he began to doubt.
Thank you for your question, Pirkko-Ella.
“The last book I’ve read is...,” Anttikoski said with thought.
The reporter’s silence in the audience was a laughing stock until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books at school!
Probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I’ve read is someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski received a heartfelt applause from the public with laughter.
In the previous missionary tour, Anttikoski drew attention because he did not want to pose in his underwear because of his principle.
2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21:00, when Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm resigns last year.
Pork Apple Pear Cake Takes Tongue As It Goes
This recipe is for those who have good, acidic apples on their own, as the domestic apple is at a shocking price in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, although I think a lot of people are already growing the pear tree.
You can also make this cake only from apples if you do not want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if its pear is also planted in the cake.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seedlings.
Viipaloi.
You can melt in the boiler.
Whisk the eggs and sugar into the foam and then add the cornmeal and melt the butter.
Combine the cornstarch as maize and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add the almond flour and cornstarch, mix well.
Pour the breadcrumbs with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the bowl and spread the pear strips over the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear strips and the apple slices over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple slices.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully browned.
Let it cool in bed and then cancel for the waiters.
Cut the cake until it has cooled down.
The cake is fragile in structure and crunches easily because the dough contains almond and corn flours that do not contain gluten.
An international crime literature event will be held in January.
Kuusamon Ruka will host an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature for the first time in January.
The programme of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary-themed programme numbers as well as jazz music.
Among the literary guests of the festival are the Swedish writers Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund, the Swedish twin Jerker Eriksson and H<0xC3><0xA5>kan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to the Swedish names, the event also features writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide the framework for a unique literary experience.
Status Symbols Do Not Attract Friends - Four Facts About Popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who analyzed the case, have identified two species of "coolness" that are made up of slightly different traits: the generally charming coolness and, in that regard, the opposite of dissenting coolness.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers, had many socially desirable traits: they were outgoing, friendly, fit, and qualified.
For dissidents, distance, independence, insurrection and oppression were typical.
They thirsted for experience and only cared a little about external evaluations.
Both types were combined with a good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardcore is no longer cool: high status at a teenage age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 U.S. study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who date early, get tickets, apply for good-looking stunts, and seek the favor of others, as young adults, had an increased risk of using studs and engaging in crimes.
In their human relationships, they were less successful than their unremarkable peers.
High-status locks, purses or watches don’t make a person cool – or at least a truly attractive companion.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more willing to befriend their regular branded shirt than those dressed in a branded shirt — despite the fact that most people chose to wear a branded shirt when they were introduced.
If you are on a Greek holiday island, be careful!
There's a thunderstorm hitting - a weather warning screams red
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland on average in half a year.
Zorbas storm hits Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the region of Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
The Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The upcoming storm is also reported by the weather service Foreca blog.
According to it, the hardest trees in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm hit Finland in the first week, blowing at its hardest just 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the major concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but heavy rain.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water can be found in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men's coat of arms Love Island United Kingdom?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Rarely is known that in the series Love Island Finland, Anku, the beauteous Anku, is also featured in the strange Youtube videos published in 2010.
In the videos Anku advises artisans, among other things, to make ink from the old financial paper roll.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how you can use a pair of socks to make a sill with the right spikes.
Now we put the Easter grasses to grow, but we do it a little surprisingly, Anku points out and presents the sawdust, sock pants and rye grass seeds from which he makes a sill.
You can watch the videos below or from Ankun’s YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas vibrated and exploded adrenaline in Sochi. Is he going to be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas vibrated a little more tens of minutes after the Russian GP kick-off when he was in front of the media.
A fine round was left behind Mercedek’s first-place finisher Lewis Hamilton and was, of course, a critically important one for the Finnish finisher this season.
It's a nice ride.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the jury.
It feels good, I still vibrate a little bit, Bottas found out.
I’ve only been to the ball once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so the time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got good laps again.
The Sotshin track is not easy to skip, so the start is particularly big.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he will drive tomorrow to win the championship or whether there is a jeep from Hamilton who is approaching the championship.
My starting point in the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the ball, Bottas.
But in the stable, we're fighting for both championships.
“Lewis’ lead to Sebastian Vetteli is quite big and the difference is very big for me, so it should be kept in mind.
Let's see what happens, though, Bottas did.
After the race, Hamilton was really happy with Bottas’ success, and the Mercedes-Benz topper Toto Wolff was also pleased.
Lewis had the intention of defeating Valtteri, but he did not succeed in the scoring.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything apart to defeat Lewis.
And he was so loaded that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
Asked if the shipyard would allow Bottax and Hamilton to drive, Wolff replied with a negative.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteeian Erno Kinnunen reached the Finnish championship in the rally
The SM series of rally cars rarely ended.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up being Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen in the final race in the surroundings of Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Kitee skier Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career when he won the third place in the final race in the SM4 category of the Finnish championship.
Kinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä, who competed at Honda Civic, started the competition in Turku with the goalkeeper because the starting points were clear: placing in the top group would return the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the twins had to give compensation, when some of the additional lights failed with another special test.
There was a time when he was blind for the third time.
In a situation like this, it's not good for a fool.
On Saturday, only the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was in the second series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their forces from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said foreign forces are fighting terrorism in Syria, and the war against terrorists is “almost over,” he said.
In his UN speech, Muallem also urged Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
There is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that a meeting with Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey is planned to take place in October.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court justice drama from TV
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, got an exceptionally large number of people out of the box.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee drama hit at least 20 million people on its televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Donald Trump appointed Kavanaugh and the California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee telling their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed on six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, several million more were followed by online consultations.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people, and CNN reported a year-long record of 8.2 million on the launch of the live broadcast.
CNN’s number will rise to more than 10 million, according to YouTube and Facebook followers.
Fox News Digital has also reached $8.0 million.
The digital launches are channel’s own, the TV viewer numbers come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they are dizzy anyway.
Rarely exceeds 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers are usually accessed only by sporting events as well as major Oscars and Grammy Awards, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and in 2016 presidential campaigns.
The most watched annual program in the United States, the NFL Football League Finals Super Bowl, is, of course, a journey.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Nielsen said Trump’s first speech to Congress was attended by a total of nearly 48 million people and 30 million officials.
The Most Important Thing
The appointment of the Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are life-long.
Trump already managed to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second seat was opened when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was on a number of issues the so-called vocabulary, the voice of which could resolve the nine-person court's position.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, decided in 2015 by a vote that same-sex couples were given the right to marry throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his view.
His election to the Supreme Court could be shut down by the conservative superpower for decades.
Children have the right to access their information to their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health information of their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Of course, the situation at Kanta-service was even more worrying: the parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of the little ones.
A temporary correction was made in the autumn of 2016 for persons under the age of 10.
Since then, it has been promised to rectify the practices, but it has taken an astonishingly long time to rectify.
Now the correction is underway - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the amendment of the legal basis should not have been more than a matter of scrutiny.
After that, the understanding of the earth is about pressing a button: now that the tape is held, it is opened.
Of course, the child can show his or her information to his or her parents - if he or she has a bank ID or an official ID card.
How many 10 year olds are there?
The ID card is paid, and the 10-year-old does not even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, the information of the fourth grader of the elementary school cannot be seen by anyone other than by requesting it in printed form.
It is not so much the right of parents as the right of children.
It is extremely important for the child’s care that the parents can be involved in it.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where all things can not be freely talked about.
They are often related to sexual health, which is a deeply relevant human right to care for freely.
In the United States, the FBI began filing charges of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment made by at least two women.
One of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into a more restrictive investigation, and it may not be public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The smuggler was still pounding in the chamber.
Police say they put the man in a police prison to "rest."
Police were threatened by a suspected perpetrator on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The official reported the case, which began when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a fierce dispute at a central restaurant.
The man first molested a second customer inside the nutrition store.
This was followed by removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by throwing him to the ground.
When a third party tried to intervene, the man still beat him.
A three-way assault led to a police call.
The party arrested the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the cops.
Police say they have taken the man to police prison to “remain calm.”
The man is suspected of three types of abuse and violent opposition to the official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work on Indonesian Sulawesi - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at UNICEF in Finland.
Local authorities are leading rescue operations, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has complete emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Please, in the city of Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region, slightly northerly, the situation is more ambiguous.
There are still places where connections don’t work.
Aid efforts are difficult, because the roads are also cut off, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter -- first of all, tents -- and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First, people are most often able to provide water purification tablets, which are also in stock with Unicefill.
Water systems will be repaired as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water will not be transported by rail, for example.
In crisis situations, many children have to get rid of their parents.
Searching for family members and family reunification is one part of UNICEF’s mission field.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is part of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP).
In the initial phase, funds previously raised will be used for emergency relief.
Unicef, among others, has already started fundraising to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk to Quit Tesla as Chairman of the Board of Directors - $ 20 Million in Twitter Penalties
Elon Musk, the founder of the company that manufactures spacecraft and electric cars, avoids fraud charges in an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Elon Musk, a billionaire billionaire, will end his term as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors and will face a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Authority.
By agreeing Musk avoids fraudulent accusations.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud over his tweets in August.
In those, Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull Tesla out of the stock market, which led to the company’s stock price rising rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to serve as Tesla’s chairman of the board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and include two "independent leaders" to its board of directors.
Tesla will also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will continue to serve as Tesla’s CEO.
In addition to Musk’s personal fines of $20 million, Tesla will have to pay the equivalent of $20 million to the financial controller.
Twitter has misled investors.
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets mislead investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he had secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private equity company.
The billionaire tweeted that the company would have been bought off the stock market for $ 420 a share.
Tesla’s share price rose more than 10 percent a day after the tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk’s claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the alleged financing.
He also did not discuss the stock market withdrawal with any other management group or board of directors.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate fell 14 per cent when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a fraud case.
The news agreement is expected to confirm the company’s course again.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the clocks of the court do not ring when the wise do not move.
This is a technical problem.
The clock on the tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
Wizards point at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: even when the church crypt would sound like a mausoleum and the Urals would sound themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped due to technical reasons: it has been broken.
It has been seen by the repairman, but some part has been broken and a new part is expected, says Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by Kirkko in Helsinki -Twitter account.
In fact, the account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church clocks don't ring because of the error.
