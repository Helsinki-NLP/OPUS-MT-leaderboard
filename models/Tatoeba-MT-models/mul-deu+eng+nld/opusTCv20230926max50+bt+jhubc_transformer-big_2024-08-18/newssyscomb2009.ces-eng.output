Austria's right-wing populist victory totals 29 percent
The apparent weakening of the two sides of the great coalition to date and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties resulted in early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) has suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Korutan heythman Jörg Haider is planning a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which loses with 25.6 percent of the vote almost nine percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially among the people who triggered early elections, a literally disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP stepped down from the coalition, the people had a significant leap forward in preference to the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first response to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president and vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s presidency.
Such a development would apparently facilitate the way to the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. to the restoration of the great coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) received preliminary 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the People's Party of the European Union agreed with the populist Party of the Constituent Party (at that time the FP<0xC3><0x96> was united in 2005).
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, is obviously betting on this development and envisages a return to Vienna to national politics.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but it easily lost and fell among Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may be cooling off
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this after a meeting in New York with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't work out, then yes, then there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that it can be very difficult for the executive to intervene in court matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petra <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charges and punished by a fine, the central government can act with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself during the negotiations.
"He recommends appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the whole matter is to provide the convicted “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to the question whether he received a promise from the Indian side to deal with things, the minister avoided.
"I've got quite a lot of promises," he said.
The Czech Republic is judging the fight for the seabed
Approaching a wall-mounted electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea area.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it is the seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the 30-member staff team of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, division director, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and sometimes adds to it.
There is a working elan and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other non-fiber raw materials can be found here, but also unknown living organisms, which carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
The bottom is larger than the mainland
Today, coastal states have begun to vehemently push for new subsea territories.
According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, they exercise their rights, which were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has the exclusive right under the Convention to all resources of the continental shelf.
“Simplifiedly speaking, the continental shelf has that part of the seafloor and its substrate, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often even beyond two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf must be substantiated by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far,” adds Mikulka.
The world record was recently recorded by the success of Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater countries.
But he also gained New Zealand - the seabed area that the commission granted him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, that is about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits they will make from using the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Its applications will also be submitted gradually by other States.
They can do so up to ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins with a convention declared as a "common heritage of humanity".
No state has an exclusive status here anymore.
The right of mining in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“But the seabed is not a Klondijk,” says Mikulka’s director in a statement, stating that his “united areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually enshrined.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, according to the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, it gained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
He is licensed to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is there, it's some kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"You can mine there on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker, Rober Sandev, presents one such specificity.
It resembles a small potato or, with a bit of imagination, a fabulous shy who, according to legend, revived Golem.
German Special Forces Forces were at the time of the release of hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help in solving the crisis with hostages from Germany - experts have arrived.
When the situation deteriorated, special forces were prepared, but no deployments were made.
Further details of the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are gradually being received to the public.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to data from the defence and interior ministries.
According to the ministries, both specialists of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, airmen of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also experts in logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hi) were on the scene of the liberation.
According to a further statement from the spokespersons of the two ministries on Monday afternoon, however, there was no need for German forces, as the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a supportive force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and also eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages moved in the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
Rescues are now well underway in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there is no information yet on when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists are also expected to fly with special forces from one of the Airbus of the German airline and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly dropped a $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones Index has fallen sharply.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, the majority did not find a program to alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
The dramatic action, however, was desperately sought to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on the MP to vote in favour, although, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for the investor’s concern was that the state bailout package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose so that it fell sharply again after the notification of the package’s failure.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel Agents Record Increasing Numbers of Reservations
It looks like winter will be good for German businessmen in tourism:
According to one study, when booking trips for the next month, turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans’ desire to travel remains undisturbed.
With bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period last year as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Institute for Market Research, there are already increased number of reservations available for the autumn months.
According to the DRV, turnover in October was approximately 11 per cent higher than in 2007.
The basis for these results are the GfK numbers, which each month evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included bookings for tours that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, travel to the United States is mainly requested, the DRV said.
For these routes, the increase in bookings is about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly sought after by the Germans.
Above all, organized tours are in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food costs, the costs "are more accountable for the client than for an individually organized holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by using discounts for early bookings or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so there will again be higher turnover compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took some trips decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endless repetitive beer, beer made from poppies and prominence in circles from well-known designers.
First time on a beer lawn.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailored cut.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we’re not even three minutes on a beer lawn yet, and photographers are already throwing at us and the memory cards are filled up – that’s a flattery for me, because I’m at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
Looks like my inexpensive cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the choir was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's cut or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
The strange sights at the stand with the bananas in the chocolate are just my curtains.
One Munich woman points out to me that I tied her up wrongly: "You are free on the left, in the middle of the virgin, on the right, widowed on the back."
They're hiding a snippet from the back to the left.
"Okay," he says, smiling.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much and wear simple velvet hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and stick out on passing bare asses.
The young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he is from England and came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He seems "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooh."
That's what he's gonna tell me after he's relieved himself of his drunken thirst.
Right next to one of those hydrates that everyone thinks are trash cans.
Bob is therefore one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as is commonly said in Bavaria by free-spirited people.
Others are lucky enough not to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, they run around the area where the Oktoberfest takes place, hound health professionals who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Healthcare professionals always appear in the barns - in the four they wear a covered brace from the tent to the tent.
They work like most visitors to beer meadows: empty there, full back.
Who lies under the sail of this coffin of love is not seen.
"The salt of those who can no longer go on," one of the doctors calls me in answer to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police Release Name of Accident Victim
The name of a 30-year-old woman who died in a hospital after her car crashed in Essex.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was already released on police bail.
Turkish Diplomatic Horizons Are Expanding
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, the European powers wanted to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern shore of the Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in neo-Renaissance style.
That’s what a tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits circularly at the end of the staircases with a tower on each corner of the front, overlooking the indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly disintegrated.
But once you get inside the hinged vault, you can no longer doubt the size of the company whose westernmost gate was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of the Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which became involved in the game of empires late, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East with the help of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial forces advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there's bad news for Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1> station, too.
In 1917, an explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually faded and history has surrounded it.
Today, however, these gates to Anatolia and further to the east serve – at least symbolically – to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (ACP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is in place - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was supposed to meet one of the leading AKP foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a boat ride on the rails, reminiscent of the old-world rhythms of the well-known document Night Post, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn to its minutiae.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigms of the Turkish consensus.
It has raised suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP main tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, intentionally built on a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-detached commercial houses and shops to power, where the mid-level managers ransacked each other in business clothes and men.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today we must look to the East and the West at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But there will certainly come a time," I asked, "when will Turkey perhaps have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want such a decision to take place."
He then underlined what almost everyone I spoke with here said almost in memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea environment are equally beneficial to Europe and the United States as well as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go along these lines to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station, after another mostly spent night, I was thinking of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched as this building was being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that the European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, for the most part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back through the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at that time there wasn’t much doubt which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
The Memorable Lives of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford Music Director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As part of the district’s music plan, he founded the year on it by an excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, some of us were almost 30 – we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to indulge in any music presented to it - whether the madrigals or the Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that single man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged all along.
How often only Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
Then sing it! "
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Mayan.
No matter where the standard of music was, he always raised it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be trained as a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 or so years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by any of them – and I’ve been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors, who, according to him, simply "traveled around the world one or two ragged pecks".
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrologist William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman...and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's remarks in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, at which time he completed a dissertation on the British Rubber Industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina's Flamenco and Life, because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was captivated by the simplicity and strong load with which it acts on the viewers, and by the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda will attack for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
If the predecessor of this one-space vehicle already had a significant space, now it offers an even more spacious interior.
Improved motors are added to this, which increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this single-seater car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the introduction of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is the fact that Honda needed to rejuvenate this model for a shorter period than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe Jazz is a lesser-known model, in other markets it has become a phenomenon in sales.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, is aiming for the new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
While in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of the Honda Jazz, in 2009 there were an estimated 100,000 cars, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
In terms of the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
When it comes to the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 pieces throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The company’s management expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007 and a drop of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects it to reach 2%.
In order for Honda to achieve this share, it relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a compact five-door hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 units per year.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will divide the old continent and Japan.
The Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year, when it is unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all the dimensions of the new Jazz have increased.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more), and shaft spacing to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
There was also an increase in the size of the interior.
This advantage was achieved through the use of a new platform and the storage of a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with engine 1.4, since the volume of the luggage compartment in the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Further improvements in addition to external elements – such as LED rear lights or the possibility of a panoramic glass roof – make it easier to access the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 degrees for the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of the Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower fuel consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and delivers excellent drive system improvements at the same time as high torque at full engine speeds.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had a previous generation of the Jazz 78 horsepower car - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
The 100 horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto Bee" Prevents Collisions
To advance in the development of accident-protection technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the example of flying bees, and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Advancement Nissan Motor Co. robota developed in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Advancement Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, general manager of public relations for technology, research and development of the brand, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan security shield.
The task of the robot is to strengthen the ability to prevent crashes in the cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
The most important, however, are compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a laser range finder (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles up to a distance of two meters in the 180-degree range before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
“The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee’s movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all the maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Lab and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
In addition to accelerating and slowing, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent collisions.
“The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and to maintain itself according to that data.
It does not require storing information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, so it can function without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we’re not talking about the giga or the mega.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology in which Nissan predicts use in series cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would bring the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take a mortgage.
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Department of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to give injections, does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages at banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular-scientific online game "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or a "bad credit hotel"... or a messed-up hotel.
The hotel, and especially its reception, look cloudy, to make a person once, twice and three times think about whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site more suitable for young people than a space for the general public.
What happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel there is a dream room.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley Opens Its Capital MUFG
Bank House Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, is entering its center to spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital, with the adoption of this report accompanied by a significant decline in its exchange rate.
A week after revealing their preliminary deal, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s common shares for a unit price of $25.25, representing a total turnover of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing another $6 billion in convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange rate is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the entire operation would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares, however, lost 6.79% and rose to $23.07 at around 17.00 Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the Banking Holdings Statute,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is meant to allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time puts him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Its merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest ax of Wall Street to take a much more cautious approach than before.
The terms introduced on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been changed over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20 percent of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s executive director, explained in Tokyo, “that our participation would consist solely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and also to protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley’s securities 7% less than their book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit from the stock by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a period of time at a price exceeding 50% of the exchange rate, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, the Spokespersons Group refused to provide specific information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After investing in MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had “significantly” reduced his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has halved, while insurance costs against non-payment risk associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs took up the opposite trend on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of major Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had selected $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
To re-establish a republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee submitted to the vote, following the pattern of his opponents and friends, the draft of a new constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% of the votes were received, 7% were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the Constitution to be adopted, he had to win half of the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted east of the polling stations and the number of non-governmental organizations predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa, meanwhile, demanded the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night to Monday.
"The Constitution has won on the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Observation Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), took place quietly, concerned the text of 444 points building the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the state’s power over the economy by preserving the “development planning” of a country that lives primarily on oil from foreign companies and on the currencies sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, protected by the Correo, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, who will be able to perform two consecutive four-year terms and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will take advantage of this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution establishes the principle of free health care and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also counts on a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
In Chad, 19 hostages were released.
The Egyptian commando attacked the kidnapper of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were on Monday alive and well taken to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, an Egyptian commando was liberated in Chad.
The hostages arrived at around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, close to Cairo’s international airport.
They were immediately transferred, without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, Cairo’s outskirts of residence, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the convoys," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zohejr Garrana said on the runway of the airport.
Since her capture on September 19, during a four-wheeled vehicle safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one shelter to another by 35 unknown abductors.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one frontier director of the Aegyptous agency, the organizers of the safari.
A senior Egyptian security official suggested that 30 members of the special forces who were approaching the scene aboard two helicopters were on the runway during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the blink unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We have to recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people from our secret services, the special forces," he said, without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle on board the hijackers, killing six, including a Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Silent majority of the resort culture
The debate about funding culture fills the pages of newspapers with thumbnails and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise to prey on the poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national monuments that are dying of hunger?
What politician would remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Québec, as in Canada, we don’t have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of a mere Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Québec, the federation of societies for the history of Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers join 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy to uncover history, preserve a collection of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few years.
Often, these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, who are desperately protesting when promoters and leaders drop their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally meet at the Tribune for History and Monuments?
Benelux Governments State Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the expanding effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalization: the three countries will support the billionaire money and insurance institution as well.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to do so at the highest level, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first in the eurozone to have entered a major crisis in the wake of the international financial markets crisis, which has been spreading for more than a year, and decisions made in this regard could be seen as precedents in some respects.
According to the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy out almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
With complete certainty, the bank will sell part of its capital shares, especially - mainly insurance - activities acquired last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis stocks began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of a crisis in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company’s securities fell 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current prices of the shares, the total market capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s chief executives, this is unrealistic.
The company’s management is also blamed for the fall of Fortis’ shares of uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of a $700 billion US package.
On Monday, stocks rose slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed as the head of the bank.
The Monetary Institute was also looking for private buyers, but no one has signed up with a more serious offer yet.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
The bank’s clients have not yet panicked and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
Life and health insurance companies in the U.S., based on data from people buying medicines, often refuse the option of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust a chicken to a fox," said Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor drug prescriptions.
Insurance companies make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance incidents dependent on the health status of the interested parties, and if the risk is assessed as too great, the insurance will not even close with it.
Previously, they sent those concerned for medical examinations and entered into a contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number of the customer from pharmacies, it is easy for him to find out what medications he has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program will produce himself, what he is suffering from the disease and what is his health condition.
For example, if you regularly buy a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that you have virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also determine the risk factor, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company except paperwork, even though they pose minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that lecterns can be used for several purposes, some compounds are used, for example, against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
These represent, from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, a significant risk-increasing factor, whereas the first-mentioned difficulties are not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been set up, which before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacists, ask the patient for consent.
They are now forced by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently been processing the results of laboratory tests, which combine with data on the drugs used, so that they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, while controlling their use is becoming increasingly complex.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to the providers of health services and the insurer.
The bill, which will give the authorities the power to control companies specializing in data provision, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he has developed his programme in such a way that the transfer of data is bound by the explicit consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the authorisation in question can hardly be refused, otherwise the insurance companies will not enter into a contract with it.
So the chickens are only slightly referred to the leaf of goodwill.
The Global Marseilles Menu
The European Union and India doubling trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this theme has also led, alongside other, mostly global, issues, to the agenda of the Ninth Summit.
The French-Indian summit will also take place today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power, which should be given more opportunity to speak to international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in the question of supporting permanent membership in the New Delhi.
This question has not yet been discussed at yesterday’s, already the ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, respectively, and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double or increase trade turnover in more than a hundred billion years.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a sign of this, twenty-six already-existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally harmonised, so that air transport was also given the green for the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy has promised that the negotiations will be accelerated.
While the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among the EU’s partners.
The Summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, and terrorism - both sides in all its forms have condemned and called for an accelerated convening of the UN conference.
They also called for the end of the round of trade negotiations from Dauh<0xC3><0xA1>, although both have a large share in its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as that at next year’s climate conference it would be necessary to conclude a global agreement and reduce the production of greenhouse gases by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister is on his way to the French capital, where he plans to close a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the commissions for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros will be obtained by French companies.
According to the agency reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects this edition of more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries, who will occupy 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting at Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is still decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying across the Nevada desert, were found.
The debris was discovered on an upper level at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains on the plane.
Madera County Sheriff, John Anderson, unraveled the remaining doubts: "The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we're sure it's exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) announced that a few hours after the debris was detected, an investigation team was sent to identify the aircraft: it is exactly the Bellancu 8kcab, unknown since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Kd<0xC4><0x9B>rv<0xC3><0xA1>rv<0xC3><0xA1> Ne in Yerington.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple near their residence in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a journey around the world in an air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew the world by plane and without landing.
His many records also include a 15,445-metre flight over the Andes, albeit with a copilot.
Glk, an advertisement you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decision lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the whirlwind of news into this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk will be unexpected and unconventional and will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that accompanies the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the automotive brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan’s main business class, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will get the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be lit up at different moments in all its smallities, so that it will then fold into a single image again.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
So we already know who the Italian chuligans are
Triveneta, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale Azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never done excessive problems.
She has never even met her opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders are from Triveneta.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags, on which appear the cities of origin of the participants: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they were not recognized.
Inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, real Nazi fans, Levsky, were found.
Figc has made available 144 tickets to the Italian fans for the match: all in the name, thus easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with Dasl going on, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans, who had previously had offenses from the stadium, were denied a ticket and the match was banned.
Now Viminale waits to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then takes action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, in short, will no longer step into a single stadium.
Good luck with that.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means more than one hundred and fifty are added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," Viminal said in a statement.
So, "properly open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Le<0xC4><0x8D>i".
In Puglia there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio will meet on Tuesday at Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, a secret service that is concerned with the problems at the stadiums.
"Science Leader-Leader and a tight arm during Mamela's anthem? In Bulgaria it's not a crime..."
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unhappi way), who for a few weeks was the director of the Viminal Observatory (he gained a position that was previously Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate leaders, but, of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I’m not a sociologist,” adds the Observatory’s Number One, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
So far this group has remained within the bounds, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistling at Mamela’s anthem: it’s not even a crime, but if you allow it, it’s uneducated...”
