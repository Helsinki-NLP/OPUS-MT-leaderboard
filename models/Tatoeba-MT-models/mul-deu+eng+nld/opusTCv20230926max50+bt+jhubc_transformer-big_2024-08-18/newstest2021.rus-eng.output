Semilarski v. prosecutor’s office: the cassation of former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's case, but in April his appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its authorisation does not fall within the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court ' s ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damages caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
“Such matters should be regulated by the prosecutor’s office and the court of departure,” Anette Kreatsmann, the press secretary of the Tartu courts, told ERR correspondent.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on 5 February did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the judge will have to say his word.
According to lawyer Semilarski, a jury lawyer for Oliver Neaes, his client was unjustifiably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the prosecutor’s office refute false claims to his address and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for the complaint to the court was the statements made by the prosecutor on special cases of the district prosecutor’s office of Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another at the time Deputy Mayor of Tartu Prestulek Artem Suvorov was detained on suspicion of suspicion.
“When I was arrested, the security police and the prosecutor’s office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the Tartu leaders – one of the most influential bodies of local self-government – were selling.
These airborne public suspicions have accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions were false, the prosecutor’s office doesn’t want to say anything about it,” Semilarski said in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyas, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor’s office should act.
“The allegations of bribery and forgery were false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia and Lithuania that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the State should be careful when choosing words so that the suspects are not represented as criminals before the sentence is handed down.
To this the prosecutor’s office also owes a presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” said Nyas.
"Public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and perpetrator in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still found to be inadmissible, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unjust in relation to claims," he said.
As wrote by rus.err.ee, former deputy mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held liable for charges of bribery - the criminal case brought against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, a former official is tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large quantities.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the meetings of the city administration in making decisions related to the companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated in person.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarsky had personal interests, and therefore he had to refrain from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor’s office has raised suspicions of receiving bribery and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large quantities.
This happened in October 2016, when he was arrested along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
The prosecutor’s office and the security police said there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov’s case later came to a court that fully justified politics.
The case of Valvo Semilarski is pending.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% of the annual - formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short step of the rate reduction, as well as the tone of the ECB’s statements and the updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation may soon come to a halt.
“We have continued the mitigation of monetary policy, primarily given that the risks of inflation deflection still remain from 4% in 2021,” said Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, Nabiullina said, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the removal of the restrictions due to the pandemic, the economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, the construction and production of consumer goods expanded, the annual rate of decrease in sales, transport traffic slowed.
According to the clarified forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the reduction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (previously expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, and in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the CB expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the forecast of the Bank of Russia on inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% versus the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, economists for Russia and CIS “Renaissance Capital” Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko believe.
For example, the Bank of Russia is consistently lowering the key rate more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
At a meeting in June, the Central Bank immediately lowered it by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that has been hampered by the pandemic and its associated constraints.
Chances for monetary policy adjustment remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Evgeny Koshelev.
The set of pro-inflationary risks also points to the nearness of a pause in the mitigation of interest rates - disrupted supply chains, potential cost increases due to measures to prevent the epidemic and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
In order to complete the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Ko<0xC5><0xA1>elev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly on the mortgage, says the senior economist of the analytical management of the bank "Open" Maxim Petronevich.
The adjustment of the rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.
Interest rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage point during the second half of the year, interest rates on mortgages may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude economist "BKS Prime Minister" Anton Pokatovich.
Average rates on deposits, he believes, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now just above 4.5%).
Further, they can fall to 4% if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in autumn, Pokatovich believes.

Olya met with Sasha, they began a stormy love, - said Stepanova in a video on her YouTube channel.
“It was a very beautiful story, they gave birth to a baby immediately, everything was beautiful and wonderful.
At some point, Sasha was tired of all this, he wanted to walk a little bit.
And if any other woman treats this normal (well, you think, went for a walk, dance a little), then it is not about Olya.
She can't tolerate such things.
And his story of a little walk ended in the fact that the sister immediately married another man and immediately gave him a child.

He wanted to give it back, but he didn’t know how to give it back.
They maintain a friendly relationship, they have a common child, but he still can’t come to himself.

Survey: The ruling Union of peasants and "greens" of Lithuania again led the rating of the parties
The Union of peasants and "greens" of Lithuania, leading the ruling coalition of the Sejm, led the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the company of sociological studies Vilmorus por ordering the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After the victory in the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost the first place and for a long time led the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (conservatives).
However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, evaluating the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Farmers and "Greens" after this year's parliamentary elections is likely to be able to form a coalition again.
This statement provoked resentment from the Conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if the parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of the voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 percent for the Conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus Vladas Haydis, the gap is within the limits of error, and nevertheless the rulers have ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Haydis, the sociological success of the “farmers” contributed to the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saulus Skvernialis.
This politician was the first on the list of "farmers" and in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of the respondents are now ready to vote.

The fourth is the Labour Party, led by a businessman of Russian origin Victor Uspassky (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, according to the poll, will not be able to overcome the 5 percent electoral barrier.

The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurements.
In the autumn session of the plenary meeting, the State Duma plans to consider in the second reading a bill establishing the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, which can only be participants of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The amendments are made by the government to the law "On purchases of goods, works, services of certain types of legal entities".
The draft law was developed in compliance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents, which the customers have the right to require in the context of the application from the participants of the procurement - small and medium-sized enterprises.

Requirements for the content, form, registration and composition of the application for participation in the purchase are established by the customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, the customers establish excessive requirements for the content, the submission of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, excerpts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized authorities is the period of the acquisition of the goods and the parties will be compared with the period of the submission of applications, which leads to inconvenience.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents, which the customers have the right to demand as part of the application from the participants of the procurement, which are the subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises.
"Acceptance of the document will allow to exclude the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants, which are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises," - said in the explanatory note.

Its so-called "dead quartet" included four criteria - this is an increase in blood pressure, cholesterol, sugar and waist volume, the doctor told on the TV channel "Russia 1".
Butchers urged everyone to pay attention to these factors.
According to him, controlling the volume of the waist is even more important than weight.
For men, this parameter should not exceed 102 centimeters, for women - 88 centimeters.

We will remind, earlier Butchers told why you can eat candy at night.
The doctor explained that sugar in itself is not dangerous for health, the dessert will be harmful only when you eat such food in large quantities, and candy for the night, he said, is not the worst snack.

The material with their opinion was published by CNN on July 23.

Experts have accused Pompeo of “politicizing the position of secretary of state and desecrating the institution he runs,” in order to promote his personal political program and protect Trump from “the responsibility and rule of law.”

During working trips to the regions of Ust-Ordinsky Buryatsky District, the head of the region gave a number of assignments.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orde has been renewed.
The commission on this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation been able to move from a dead end.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for the construction is 2022.
And already this year, the school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises is completed.
The rest of the work is the improvement of the territory.
In general, the programme for the construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance to the region.
For your district, in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and recreation of children of all ages, - said the vice governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region mandated all mayors to actively engage in the development of the settlement plans.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a general plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage objects, - emphasized the head of the region.

Authorities of Podmoskovy talked about the fate of closed depots
In the Sub-Moscow continue to close the polygons of solid household waste.
This year, the government has promised to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being modernized into modern waste-processing complexes.
But such an option is not possible for every field - many of them grew up in dense residential development.
After the polygon is closed, it is recultivated - the body of the polygon is flooded with soil, degassing and infiltration systems are installed.
This allows to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, so that it does not cause irritation, poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump remains to rise up a useless bunch amongst those who have gone past its residential construction.
Why don't we make something useful out of her?
For example, in Ruz, where the recultivation of the Annino estate has literally ended in the days, the authorities are considering an option to make a pile of ski slopes.
This estate, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated under it.
Therefore, when recultivation had to buy out the neighboring areas, de-facto already sealed with garbage for a long time.
Some time will pass, the field will "reach", will build up the fortress, and we will think what can be done to make it start to benefit.
Right in the eye is a ski resort," Nikolai Parthenov, the head of the Ruz district, told reporters.
The two fields will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources.
The "Torbeevo" in Luberets and "Timohovo" in Bogorodsky district will be the sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from waste and biological gases.
On the territory of "Torbeyeva" by the end of the year will be launched a gas piston power plant, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide the own needs of the polygon.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste-processing complex.
And on the "Kuchino" in the Balashichina shelf, which was closed after complaints of residents on the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"It was such an idea - to create a museum of recuperation of polygons of Podmoskovy", - said the deputy government - the minister of ecology and nature use of the area Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful tall minarets only decorated Aya-Sofia
Once again about Aya-Sofia - got the text about Vladimir Zelinsky, which, please, needs to be protested.
First, there was a free entrance - hurrah!
I was not in Istanbul, but in the House of God there is better free entrance than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Okskoye Interlocution, the Muslim Caucasus (and put the church in the Gracious) and planted the apples on Mars.
God help me!
The Jews have conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered the Americas.
Are we going to give it back to everyone?
Do you think there will be pagans who will demand to return their chapel, in the place of which the Tenth Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims have improved the building and invested funds in it.
That is, it owns them as well as the factories and estates which the Leninists have taken from the bourgeoisie to their property, belonging to the Leninists - Putin and the other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all in their progressive right.
Beautiful tall minarets decorated Aya-Sofia very, very.
There was a stupid minaret, there was a stupid minaret with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are rabbis who unite faith and hypocrisy.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Ministry official Toynbee, who believes it's a shame to think so.
There is a place of prayer for believers everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to be removed from - he is removed to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're dolphins, not rocks.

I knew that Briant’s self-love couldn’t be touched by a treble stream to avoid stimulating his athletic anger.
Coby had a killer's instinct, so on the pitch I tried to talk him out so he didn't take the game aggressively.
On the field, I complimented him: "Oh!
Coby, good shot, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that we have to take the ball in our hands again and score another 3-4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi," Kirilenko said, referring to "Evening Moscow".

"I took care of him.
The first three minutes of the match I ran in complete admiration of the fact that there was a legend next to me that I only saw on TV.
While I'm happily breathing, Michael has scored a lot of points.
Soon I left my delights, a couple of times I covered his throws...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points,” added the head of the RFB.

The actor of the Russian series responded to the accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki", whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to claims to the film.
The authors “understood the sharpness of the themes raised and did not want to offend anyone,” American Steven Thomas Oxner said in an interview with The Rise.
“I think it’s a story about the power and common aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the father of the boy, who was dressed in women’s clothes.
He stressed that he is “proud of the work” and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is intimidated by the reaction of some people to the plot line of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep poo shot the shooting platform and said that all this is not true."
“Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who came first with the complaints started to help us,” he said.
The shooting, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a car of a shooting group with weapons, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public officer for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor to the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki".

The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "a lot of attention was paid to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
