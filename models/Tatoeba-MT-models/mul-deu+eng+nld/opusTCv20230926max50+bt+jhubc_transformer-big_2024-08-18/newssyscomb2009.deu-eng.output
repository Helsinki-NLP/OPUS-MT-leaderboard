Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they come to 29 percent in total
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the hitherto large coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the preliminary results of Sunday’s parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously at stake.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Carinthian head of state Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 percent of the votes remains the strongest force in the country, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the <0xC3><0x96>VP cuts off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in post-war Austrian history, and especially in the People’s Party, which had called for the pre-election, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
Voters, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible resignation of party chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party leadership on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral bloc, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties, the Liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) received only 18% of the vote, while the BZ<0xC3><0x96> received 11% of the vote, the Social Democrats expressed their fears that in 1999, the populists could repeat themselves with the populist party.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to work with any party, is obviously on this development and is going from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also joined the parliament, but suffered slight losses and broke from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent gate, and consequently did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India could cool down
If it fails to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, in the opinion of the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then certainly, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in court cases, the executive could only be difficult to intervene.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government wants the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be clarified," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, it would be best for Mukherdshi to appeal to a higher court.
He could thus seek bail and wait for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same in the negotiations.
"He recommends a summons to a higher court, then a pardon is in question for him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted person "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such assistance would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit it too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of its partner, confirmed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to incarcerate and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received the pledge from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister said.
“I’ve already been promised quite a lot,” he said.
A Czech is aiming for the ring around the seabed
He appears on an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it with and by.
There is work and enthusiasm here.
So far, the seabed has a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find petroleum, as well as ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms that, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The Anrainer States vehemently announced today their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches into the sea up to a few hundred kilometers away from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
“Simplifiedly, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to represent a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the coastal sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant Commission country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be substantiated by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five proposals from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” adds Mikulka.
An international echo was encountered recently by the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed approved by the Commission last week for the country is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits they will receive from the use of seafloor in the future will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
You can do this for ten years from the moment you ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity".
No state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold-digging land," Director Mikulka said with some exaggeration, adding that "individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, due to the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, it was granted the status of a so-called "bahnbrechend investor".
The organization has the right to promote ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seafloor is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seafloor.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such concreteness as a pattern.
It reminds me of a small potato or, with some imagination, the legendary scheme that the Golem legend has brought to life.
German Special Forces were on the scene at the time of hostage release
The Egyptian government had called for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven abducted European tourists in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Federal Army as well as officials of the GSG 9, the flight crew of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Plant were at the site of the liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the ministries continued on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because the hostages had their prisoners run and fled when they had recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany in order to involve them as support forces on the ground.
"Fortunately, this has not happened," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
Attackers had kidnapped the travel group from five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and eight Egyptian escorts on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The survivors have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information at first when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion hefty package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on lawmakers to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t even happened yet,” he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke by more than 6 percent or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout package might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after becoming aware of the failure, to fall down again.
Experts are now expecting further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the consent of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for German tour operators:
With travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study – even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic outlook, the Germans’ desire to travel remains undiminished, according to a study.
With the bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in revenue compared to the previous year period, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the research of the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales increase of travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The basis for these results are figures of the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and calculates for the total market.
Included are the travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the United States was particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local territories, are particularly popular destinations in Germany.
In particular, package trips are high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "better computable for the customer than individually organized holidays".
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so there will again be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest.
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from litre-curves and fame in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, already the photographers are crashing on us and cutting the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to be fulfilling its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White-Wurst equator, the feeling of well-being in wear still remained within limits to this day.
But once we got to the Theresienwiese, everything was half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks awkward or embarrassingly touched - everything is completely normal.
Rare glances at the chocobanana stand only reap my dirt skirts.
A monk points out to me that I had incorrectly tied the apron: "Lefts hoast free, middle virgin, right pardoned, back widowed."
At home, I am frying my loop from the back to the left.
"Pass," he said, and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches the naked back against an undesired person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "oooo".
He tells me that after he has emptied himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants, of which everyone thinks he's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, paramedics run across the main square, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the hut - always four at a time pull a covered tray from tent to tent.
It works like most Wiesn visitors: Empty, full back.
Who lies in the promille sarg under the plane, you can't see.
"These are the ones that goarnimmer pack," one of the nurses called to me on request and disappeared in the tummy.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the crash on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of driving lightly.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey Expands Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested to penetrate deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial aspiration.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the tour guides tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the railway staircase with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building collapsed.
But once inside the curved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a late mover in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist plans faded during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely out of history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the quarry.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a very new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian separatist groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the background data of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about one and a half hours later, after a pilgrim ride on rails that produced the passage of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city, for the new secular project, the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has sparked some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP’s main business, a specially crafted, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs in which the middle managers are wearing suits, and he drags off the men and women as well.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Costume, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is now to re-integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, it has to look both east and west at the same time.
There would be no one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
“But surely Turkey could at some point,” I asked, “could be forced to make a decision?”
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here routinely said: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can travel eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East on flat rails.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now lie too far in Turkey’s hands.
And while I was waiting at the landing site for the ferry to take me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At that time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Dead" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chorus.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was meant for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and was unique and unique thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which has never failed over the years.
How often did death hold us to "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
“Sing it!”
His manner of directing was absolutely clear and precise, but never mastery, but never superfluous.
No matter how high the musical level, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor were to be beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He detested conductors who, according to his words, simply "went home with one or two well-known sheep in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In her appeal to William Woodruff (September 25), she writes that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham permanently and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to spoil this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in the style of documentary, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and because of the power they emit, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
The second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-sized limousine offers an even larger one.
In addition, there are technical features that allow even more comfortable driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this grand limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz was released on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while a Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the estimated growth in the European market.
In terms of the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of total Honda sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to pamper the sales downturn in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to end the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain (1.6%) to 1.8% from the previous year.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters), and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown to 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing the dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-liter petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows for low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance while at the same time providing high torque performance for the entire engine run time.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of fuel consumption and a CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In terms of the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 has 5.4 litres of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
<0x60>Auto-benefit' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature, to be more precise, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight relies on the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s technical development center developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own, oval-shaped flight compartment, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee’s facet eyes, which can see from a 300-degree angle in all directions, allowing her to fly uninterruptedly in her personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and are within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board, which is directly translated into a signal to avoid collision
At the moment of obstruction, the little robot will mimic the bee fly and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels at 90o or greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasion maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it wasn’t, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project’s lead engineer.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate up or down, nor overturn; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
<0x60>This device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act according to this information.
It does not need to store either the information or the intuitive logic of the exercises performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology predicted to be introduced by Nissan in the next ten years in the production cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide it to the destination while avoiding obstacles in the way.
She's shaking before she gets charged with a mortgage.
One must recognize that the U.S. Treasury, apart from having sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid US citizens getting involved in mortgage histories of supposedly-payable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for internet surfers: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’, it says.
Or maybe, the <0x60>Hotel of bad credits' or the mess of each other.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times whether it’s time to ask for no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is a site for teenagers rather than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the launch of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion, taking over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
A week after an interim agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock at a unit price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is below 19% of the share price as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be done on the basis of a single average price of $29, which is 28% above the current exchange rate.
The Morgan Stanley stock, however, fell by 6.79% to $23.07 from 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which is intended to allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
“A week ago,” said Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of the MUFG in Tokyo, “we thought the stake would consist entirely of stock.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their exchange rate for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go off with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in a year if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% above the selling value within a given period, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet, and increase his sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency rate of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said his balance sheet had been “significantly downgraded” since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been tough for the group, who had to watch their exchange rate fall by half, while the price for insolvency insurance has accelerated upwards.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ‘survivor’ of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, have $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The republic was re-established around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
It was that third who, following the example of his peers and friends, chose this Sunday the plan of a new constitution.
Mission fulfils, because according to the public results, which amount to 80% of the voter votes, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were submitted empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations’ exits and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for <0x60>yes', and predicted it from 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project.
The <0x60>Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held in silence according to the Observation Board of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to ensure the ‘new socialism’ for which the President is committed.
The draft Constitution transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that lives largely on the oil production of foreign companies and on the currencies that send emigrants to the country.
The project, promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of each four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will take advantage of this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the hijackers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to Egypt’s capital healthy and intact on Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base next to Cairo International Airport at 3:30 p.m. a.m.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter, to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy ‘best health’ and the kidnappers ‘no ransom was paid,’ Egypt’s tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said in a statement.
After being captured at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya on September 19, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown hijackers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“On both sides, shots fell and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled,” the official said, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
“We have to recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence services and the special forces,” he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom has been paid.
On the eve of a patrol, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a vehicle in which the hijackers were located, six of whom, including the Chadian leader, killed and two arrested.
The army stated that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), which immediately disputed this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate about the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and appease the miserable sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations, or the national historical sites that mournfully starve?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.5 million alone for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours have written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, by all deputies and by all governmental districts, in a mutual agreement.
In Quebec, the Association of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, with a few large ones to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision-makers drop their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments State Parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux states want to take over the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been in turmoil due to the US financial crisis: the three states provide the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Commissioner for Competition.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the bank could be precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its shares, primarily the insurance activities acquired by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis stocks began a steep downhill journey last week, with serious crisis scenarios already taking place in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a deal.
The Institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
In view of current stock prices, the group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
According to the management, the $700 billion American bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is to blame for the downward movement of Fortis stocks.
On Monday, however, the prices have increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should shake his money, it said.
So far, there has been no panic among the customers, and the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the Chicken Stall
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer in America.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
“There are privacy programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the chickens to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees as well as the repayment amounts in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the client was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more favorable method: based on the customer’s identification number, he draws on the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, say which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates what disease the customer is suffering from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatable, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurances have to do more than the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraines and heatwaves, but also against depression.
The latter is, from the point of view of the insurers, a high risk factor, while the ones mentioned above are not.
For the enquiry and processing of the data, own companies have formed themselves, who, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though omissions have not been enforced so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug consumption, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of its use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a separate data protection law for health data, its impact extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, which allows authorities to control data processing companies as well.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the data subject can hardly deny access to his or her data, since otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him or her.
And so the chickens are left in some way to the grace of the fox.
Global Meal Plan from Marseille
European Union and India doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this was the main theme, among other global problems, at the Ninth Summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, where cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is mainly discussed.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic major power that should be given more votes and access rights to international affairs, the Member States have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and the current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached that trade should be doubled to EUR 100 million in the next five years.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that in the future air traffic will also be flown.
India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked nine among the EU’s partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as with the proposal, to make a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The head of government of India is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are expected.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided on 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expected to host more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and will present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the host of the event.
The Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 square meters exhibition space “Punto Italia”.
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sector is decreasing.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's Missing Small Plane Found a Year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire missing on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was discovered.
The specimens have been found on a 3000 m high plateau in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane, however.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson completely dispelled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, a troop has been sent to, and now we have the security that it is the plane that Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (NTSB) reported that a crew had been sent a few hours after the plane was sighted, which identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after flying Fossett in Yerington 3, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were finally found in California, not far from the border with Nevada, by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two passports with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to circumnavigate the world in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without an intermediate landing by a plane.
Among his several records is an altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you didn't expect
A suv that falls out of the traditional scheme due to its original design and special line guidance, the exhausting surface and its clear angles.
With this offroader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Due to its exceptional features, the Suv Glk will also appear unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the promotional drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various phases, which will take over the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car so apparently emerges from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments to reassemble itself as a whole.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes’ concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of car advertising into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
Among these were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They wear the tricolors on which the cities of the militants appear: however, these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans had 144 cards for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, no one was with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to initiate further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified at the protests can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now, of course, there is fear of mimicry, which could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be immediately put out, and this does not in any case give such behavior the possibility of justification," the Viminal said in a statement.
That's why, "look at especially also looking at the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Apulia there is a small core of Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (sport supervision) will gather on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on some of the comfort, i.e. the intelligence services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who for a few weeks has been the director of the Osservatorio at the Viminal (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly the police president of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now originates.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the No. 1 of the Observatory, “crimes are perpetrated in the country of their act.
Until now, this group had remained in control, but now it has to be considered what has happened and what will happen.
But we are also talking about the peacocks during the hymn of Mamelis: this too is not a crime, but they allow me, because there is no education...”
