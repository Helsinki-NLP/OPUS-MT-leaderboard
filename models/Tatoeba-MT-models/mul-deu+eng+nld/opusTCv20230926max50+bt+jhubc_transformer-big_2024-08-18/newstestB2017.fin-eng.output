28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a shopping mall staircase this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who would have wanted to harm his brother. "He had finally got his case in order."
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco student Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco forensic agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job to become a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative for Sons & Daughters said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We are a small and tight team, like a family. We miss it big," the representative says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frankin first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his things in order.
“He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend,” Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn’t know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his little brother.
“He was kind and generous.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who walked with the stream.
“Despite all the misdeeds in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shined every day,” he says.
For any case, please call 415-575-4444 from the San Francisco Police Department.
The strikers call for new labor-fighting measures
Representatives of British junior physicians (who are mainly specialists in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and asked for permission for new labour-fighting measures in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), a member of the British Union of Physicians (BMA), is asking its entire government to support additional labour-fighting measures starting in early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students voted against the agreement with the BMA in a vote held in July.
58% of the members voted against the agreement.
The chairman of the board of junior physicians, Ellen McCourt, posted a letter on Twitter Thursday night to members of the JDC, saying the government had "persistently failed" on issues that McCourt said led to the deal's rejection.
In light of this, the JDC government in its vote has completely rejected the new draft agreement and calls for all of our concerns to be re-negotiated.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted an official request to the BMA government asking for permission for progressively expanding labor-fighting operations starting in early September."
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete job postings ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, the head of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote, as he did not accept the negotiated terms recommended by BMA.
Malawana told BMA members at the pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be accepted, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was the act that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to negotiate a settlement and to formally end the eight-month-long war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in his St. Petersburg Palace in the Golden Hall, I got the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties have retaliated,
But Putin’s smile seemed thin and he didn’t quite suffocate the heat even at his own restraint.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly referred to Mr Putin as his “good friend” – according to a report five times.
I didn't stay on the bills myself.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia would recover even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I realized his enthusiasm, quite the opposite.
But the constant coldness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time of the incident was outrageous.
Putin attacked Ankara in strict terms and accused him of stabbing his back.
The injury was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting back to real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
One of the most serious accusations by top officials was that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only to allow Putin to apologise to President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could win some sort of victory.
The benefits of declaring an uprising to the harsh are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost expelled from power last month in a failed coup d'état.
The recurring terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic impact on reconciliation.
Russia’s sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter ban, as millions of Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 percent.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies will certainly suffocate for relief when air traffic can finally be resumed.
They put their faith in the late arrival of the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruits and vegetables will fall as Turkey’s agricultural products are allowed to import again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", was formulated in the Vedemost article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it believes the West is responding quietly to the coup attempt.
Not to mention the old outrage over Turkey’s upcoming EU accession negotiations and Putin’s intervention, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool intersections and to break Turkey’s ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own aggravated concern about the coup d’etat.
Thus, Russia and Turkey could, at their summit in a beautiful seaside palace, convey an image described by an analyst as an “external ally”: two countries that feel that the West is being rejected and unfairly treated are joining forces.
Despite the public conciliation effort, the two still have major disagreements.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told a press conference that they had not dealt with the issue at all.
Turkey’s president resolutely refused to answer the question of the differences between the two countries, while Putin, on the other hand, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where to look for an agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by a NATO Member State when it shot down a Russian fighter, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are again even in the interlocutors.
Royal Bank of Scotland Banks Disappear from Customers Outside Scotland
According to the CEO of RBS, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will in the future only provide business services, so-called back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is losing its customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally associated with the Bank’s global goals.
The bank had to step back from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and was forced to save.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now the front line has been considered right to allow more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it does not use the abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, except for the head office and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed for clients and staff during a presentation in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "RBS is becoming an investment brand and that's why our staff is serving because we are now becoming a much more diverse brand bank.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now, our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring the Six Nations rugby, and it has raised the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
“Now is the right time to switch to a bank with different brands, because basically it’s a question of how we can make the bank better for our customers,” says the bank’s CEO.
“Three years ago it would have been very exciting if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on customers’ needs rather than our own needs has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rode with Predilection to victory at Newmarket and achieved his 3,000th win
The detector showers the champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, marking his 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British championship series at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone by riding his horse twice to victory on the same night on the track of his hometown. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing on a flat track.
He was previously joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayari, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the ground, because my family is here, too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because I ended up here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and an audience of 20,000.
I am relieved and I feel great humility.”
The detective will accept the insults with Predilection after his win
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in blockbuster competitions, and they are champion hockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of all time, and it’s no surprise that he’s the one who reached this milestone that few have ever reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and his passion has brought fans to the species over the years."
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 races if he didn’t only compete on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie’s riding career in the UK has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He’s a lively person, which is good for the British race, but above all, he’s an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori fanned his accomplishment in an iconic way by flying down from the back of his horse.
“From flying innings to flying downings, Frankie Dettori has been an example of British racing excellence for two decades.
The journey has gone up and down.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996's "Magnificent Seven", but in addition he has survived a plane crash and has been banned for drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had trouble starting, but he showed the admirable strength of character, appeared to his suspects and returned to his best.
And he hasn’t finished his career in a while – Dettori has recently said he wants to keep competing until he’s at least 50.”
Putin Resigns Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin’s trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian Presidential Administration", but the reasons for his resignation were not disclosed.
Anton Vaino, who has been acting as Ivanov’s Deputy Chief Executive since 2012, was appointed.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the President’s Protocol Department and the Government Office, according to the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
Vaino thanked Putin for his appointment, saying: “I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State, which means drafting legislation and monitoring how your guidelines are implemented."
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for his resignation and recommended Vano as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close friend of Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of government, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting on Russian state television with President Putin, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his role at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only convince a few, especially during the parliamentary elections.
Is the resignation a consequence of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official statement that the man who is a potential president is suddenly seeking to lead Russia's environmental policy.
On the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to take on my responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
I have now served as the President’s Chief Executive for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin served as the head of the KGB's replacement Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
At one time, it was thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, because the constitution would have prevented Putin’s election for the third period.
However, the mission went to another close friend of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds: FBI Investigator Thomas Gibson gets fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent clash at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, said in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known for the series, had apologised on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had some creative disagreements.
"I'm sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
The details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Formerly in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, the 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, i.e. since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
"I was hoping to see the series through to the end, but it's not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the screenwriters, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly, the best fans the series could have hoped for.”
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
Mysterious beaching of fish in the Banff Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind gusts that have fallen to the ground in the wake of a cyclone.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the seaside, published a vision of footage at Periscope and hoped to get a response to the appearance of these five-cent fish.
Queensferry crossing is now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and the land bridge to Queensferry, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four portions between the "covers" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 vinyl sawmills.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Cabinet Minister Keith Brown, who was in charge of the economy, visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing significant progress in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30,000 concrete and steels being used for the construction of this bridge.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the ground bridge and the bridge bridge is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Nearly 79% of the entire bridge is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete deck pain in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted to its place."
Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors Project Manager Michael Martin says: “Completing the first section of the bridge is always a significant urinary column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this contribution represents the pinnacle of the road and water construction sector.
After the last part of the road was installed and connected to the North Tower column, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. terrestrial) gap.
This was done by pulling land bridges 700 millimeters to the south from the north.
This was a massive and at the same time high-precision operation.
Massive, because the land is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an inclination angle of about 3%.
And requiring high precision, because the tolerances that the team had to adhere to were very small – only a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay rescue team says three men have been miraculously rescued
In front of Anglesey's fishing boat, the three men who fell into the water were saved by a miracle trade.
The Moelfre RNLI marine rescue station made the alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew spotted the crash in Moelfre Bay.
The three men tried desperately to swim in safety while their boat continued unharmed without a guide.
“We saw the boat swirling right next to them and we imagined the worst,” says Vince Jones, who drives Moelfre’s lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the waters, the strong winds had fortunately driven the boat away from them."
A local fishing boat rescued two men, while a third, a 60-year-old man, was found depleted in a beetle and without a lifeline.
All of them were taken to a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a miracle that these three men who have been in the water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The engine of the boat had an emergency dampening rod, but it had for some reason been separated from the man driving the boat when it fell.
They were really lucky on their journey.”
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It’s interesting to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside to support their boxes.
Pokémon Go allows people to get off the couch and move.
Initially, the screen time was taken only by watching television, then came video games and the latest smartphones.
So it is great to note that technology and the outside world do not exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters originate from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later made into a cartoon, game cards and other by-products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended slightly before the new game was released in the early July in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.
Launching in other countries was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In brief, players go out to look for Pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked using GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using the phone's screenshot) or "captured".
Villity has taken the video game with him to a younger generation and lifted their buttocks from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps the "average person" takes per day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch’s Cardiogram app, which found that within two days of launching the game, the number of people moving every day rose suddenly from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns, where people are encouraged to get up from the couch and move around for at least 30 minutes a day, have gone blind because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement should not be diminished.
With regular movements, the chances of getting cancer or depression are lower.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health-supporting things – exercise, rhythm and sunshine and joy.
During the hunt it is possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes repulsive joy-seekers.
And yes, someone can walk to the door when playing.
What about that?
A breakthrough has been made.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit might have been able to track your activity in the past, they didn’t give you a reason to go, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty charm disappears, and the use decreases over time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality will be combined with real-world activity, which will increase the exercise of people going hunting and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in women's racket multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless pumps.
You're lying with a permanence.
Great in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American battleship fighter won the multisport championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic Lights.
His overall score of 62,198 was clearly better than that of the silver-based "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafa.
Simone Biles will perform at the U.S. Women’s Armoured Forces singles final Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman of all time to win the championship in multiples, thus consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final points came to light and his long way to this moment was over.
Achievement takes the species to a whole new dimension and brings it to the same category of sports as other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
For the past three years, Biles has won 15 World Championship medals, including 10 golds, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest ever winner of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one final competition, which was held above all between Biles and himself and the burden of high expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to the Texas Springs with less than a chorus of gold medals would be a disappointment.
U.S. Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver in the women’s racket competition at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point i over the national team with the coordinator and now retired Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which includes a volt series known as his power card – has been adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents adopted and coach Aimee Boorman’s mother became a force figure, Boorman found the girl while on a day-to-day visit to the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost a single multi-match competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got to the small lead with two laces, it was like a fabric.
There was a boom and a permanto, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He returned to the lead after scoring 15,433 points and crowned the final with a standing score of 15,933.
Raisman gently hugged him as they waited for the final points – which was mere formality – and the tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white, and blue gleaming border colour as his dream, written once in his playbook, came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rematch for the four-year-old race, when he first took third but then lost to the bronze finisher in the relegation round.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "grandmother" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent airstrips to the public after his permanence program and thus rose from the losing position to the winner, which sometimes seemed insecure.
As for Biles, making this 19-year-old a week earlier and widespread tweet now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three people in the car have been killed by a serial killer
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder in ten years, the victims sitting in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot, police said Thursday.
On June 12, a car parked on the side of the street was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple murder was not the cause of the robbery, because the attacker did not carry handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix Police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether the deaths were related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks, which occurred mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
“It’s common for events to happen in residential areas in front of homes,” Howard told CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that their cause is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a bulletin informing about the shooting of an empty open-plan car just half an hour before the triple-killer, believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found the shells and picked up the bullet from the car seat and the bullet from the engine station.
Mother of 6-year-old son with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a congenital spleen caused by his mother Elizabeth Picciuto's genetic disorder, which she was unaware of when she was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn’t make it.
I can't make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all – of course you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some of the doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in hospital care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think such a practice would be at all,” Picciuto says.
Edmund walks with a roller shutter.
Edmund got up and started packing at the age of three, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of the note, which means "sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean the usual sign language, but it also includes the sign language invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by several different diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund’s case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zikavirus.
There is a wide variation in symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of patients with Zicavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"As always: how are we,
How are we going."
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction for a long time, because I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto has hope to give advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things are usually arranged.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Heavy rains and floods triggered massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, with further rains expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in Southeast Louisiana and Southern Mississippi flooded over their creeks and spread over a large area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says the state’s authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is already on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the National Security and Emergency Preparedness Office, said the agency received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangipahoa County has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service, there may be an additional 76–127 mm of water coming into the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood warning was issued on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record highs.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the banks of the river may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods in the lower reaches of Ascension County pose a threat as flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Louisiana’s Liverpool, just south of the Mississippi border, the Tickfaw River had already risen higher at 9 a.m. on Friday than ever before.
Rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of Southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
One of the young men who lived nearby had warned him.
“We got up, and the water came with constant feeding,” Hansford says.
"It extended to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he himself is the only one with the ability to swim.
Rescuers had rescued all three large army-style trucks and taken them to the Gloster Fire Station, where they kept shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He told a close-up observer at Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has been heavily watered after the rains began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that due to heavy rains and flooding of the streets, residents of Tangipahoa District were forced to save their homes and school hours were cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had told the CBS subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has hit both of them.
Robby Miller, the county’s head of state, says authorities have rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped in the flood.
Refugees have been opened for evacuations in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
“They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to recede,” he says.
In the city of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets were forced to close due to the flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and the premises of their businesses.
“The last time we saw a major flood in March,” says city council member Lacy Landrum.
"This flood seems to be similar."
The rains in Mississippi continued to be flat on the Gulf coast of Mexico, says Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy says Thursday there were reports of a house that had been hit by a coral flood, but there had been no reports so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has been living in the Amite region for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before, and more rain all the time.”
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who had several bullets in his body, survives a shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old, who has been shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in his hips, leg, arm and stomach, but he was aware when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets," Grandma Delores Melendez told TV.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to be alive.
He was starting his first class at a local sub-level.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The second 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the injured men might have been a gunman.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crucifix between many armed men.
The venue was full of trench coats of arms, which originated from a variety of trench coats.
“It is clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been a number of armed fighters on the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting,” said Anthony Ginaldi, the commander-in-chief of the Philadelphia Police Department.
They also hit many homes and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly going through surveillance videos.
Another victim of a shooting in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl who was hit by a sniper while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane district on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
With this name, I call the Women's Armoured Forces Olympic Team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The team’s composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
At last, the team represents the United States.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female bodybuilder has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were 1st and 2nd.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the race, and the whole of America boasted.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible achievements of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and masterful battleship training programs.
Simon became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women’s singles event on Thursday.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
The sights are similar to those at the top of the species, but the same does not appear on deck-enforced displays throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed in the same footsteps as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as there will only be four gymnasts in the next Olympic team, and this is Marta Karolyi's final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that exercise is an expensive sport and gymnasts are mainly trained in private gyms maintained by their parents. The parents are paid for training costs, facilities, trips, performance shoes, competition fees, hotel fees.
The facilities of most shipbuilding centres are located in rich residential areas that are able to support operations.
The training of the reinforcers takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of the reinforcers.
Simone Biles’ coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez’s coach Maggie Haney have both coached the breed’s enthusiasts since they began to do battleship training.
We need to organise more affordable and better accessible training for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own shipbuilding foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have offered a free or inexpensive opportunity to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latino), some of whom have competed in national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to our hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality volleyball to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic Games.
Strength training develops strength, fitness and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and work life.
This team has aroused excitement in thousands of young girls who now want to start a deck exercise, and it’s absolutely amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real “girl power” you showed when you won the Olympic gold medal, and for motivating so many different young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into a prosperous, strong and successful young woman.
Junior doctors oppose Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
The Ministers hoped to decide on the changes to the salary and working conditions of the dispute by adopting the revised agreement with the trade union representing doctors of the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58% of the 37,000 junior physicians who participated in the vote, i.e. the specialist doctor, rejected the terms of the agreement.
In July, Health Minister Hunt said plans to enforce the agreement and said the UK’s public health system (NHS) was “no one’s country” and that any additional delays were harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in unsocial times.
Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA's Committee on Junior Physicians, issued a statement yesterday saying: "Junior doctors continue to be very prepared for the proposed agreement, particularly in fear of accelerating the current labor crisis and not addressing it all.
It’s only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move on, because the time is running out.
The BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has treated the discussion companies reluctantly and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
This is despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the implementation of the contract, and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, the junior doctors are ready for new labor-fighting measures.”
The previous strike at the end of April delayed nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 reception times, when nurses and doctors were asked to support the strikers in the strike ward.
The ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the officials of the trade union representing British doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctors affected by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS, called on junior doctors not to take any further strikes.
Mortimer says: “Working struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already at the frontiers and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Committee on Junior Physicians, and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the supervisory role and the disclosure of misconceptions.
Workers were hopeful that they would be able to continue their positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, re-education from career breaks, health costs, education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, health, education, and gender equality.
A drug that costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are receiving a drug that costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day, with authorities recommending it to be given to more people and for longer-term use.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) and assessing the introduction of new treatments, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for a further four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) and assessing the introduction of new treatments, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for another four years to increase the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, with a quarter of them recurring or having a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fatty substance that accumulates in the walls of the blood vessels, which generates plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can produce a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot breaks down, it can pass through the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new stroke is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
Ticagrelor produced by the British company AstraZeneca, marketed under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tulips.
Today’s NICE guideline recommends that ticagrelor be given for the first 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and aspirin is given twice daily for another three years.
Carole Longson, professor at the Center for Implementation of Treatment Assessment (NICE), says: “While effective treatments are available that effectively prevent the progression of the disease and the onset of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack, it often gets a new stroke or stroke.
The fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation of temporary use of ticagrelor adds treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Because there are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for longer.
Due to the climate of political correctness, the polling slump in Muslim areas flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was fired last year for corruption, as a result of which the government made a report.
The climate of political correctness has led to the closing of the eyes of a widespread electoral wave in Muslim communities, a government report released today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has criticised police, election observers and city authorities for shutting their eyes to the election wave "because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
According to Pickles, the former minister of regional administration and now known as the anti-corruption force figure, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had permission to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to scare the voters.
He proposes that voters should present a identity card in order to be able to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers should be dipped in black after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be protected more, Sir Eric says.
He called for improved access for journalists to government documents and to decisions of informal boards and working groups.
“The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to fight corruption and fraud against the economic interests and the culture that favours them more broadly in the local authorities,” he says.
The British prime minister asked for a report after the East London Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that then-Mayor Lutfur Rahman be removed from office due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "disgustedly" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to use his campaign as the basis of the belief that it was the religious duty of every Muslim to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were dubious or fraudulently cast in such a way that the person voted by acting as someone else.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was obtained from all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-election wave, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were told that they had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring a certificate of identity at the polling place.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of the older members, particularly in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi background communities."
"I was concerned that ... the institutions of the state had closed their eyes to such activities 'politically correct' because of their hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists from handling postal ballots, in order to prevent the "collection of votes".
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks in the context of registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options to require voters to present their identity card prior to the vote.
Baptize your fingers into the non-going black after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and the right to vote of voters.
The setting of a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prohibition of political activists from handling filled-in ballots and postal ballots.
The police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to raise intimidation charges under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only English is allowed at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure that staff control rules allow only one person to go to the polling station at a time.
Sir Eric harshly criticizes London police and considers it "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Court of Appeal dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his duties due to corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
"They were found guilty without any reasonable suspicion, and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded for a number of reasons."
He also criticised the ineffective "crash checks" of the departments responsible for the city council's electoral lists.
“The court’s decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call,” said Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and its banning by some."
Olympic cyclist’s uniformity with Duchess Catherine and other double flights wild at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were thrilled by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose uniformity with the Duke of Cambridge is astonishing.
But according to discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship, who has a uniformity with a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose uniformity with Hollywood celebrities is evident.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the American men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the duchess Catherine’s twin soul seen on bike lanes, many people have noted on social media how one archer could be the twin brother of the actor’s favorite Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm following pictures of him posted on Twitter, in which he strikingly resembles the star of the film Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of social media and admitted that he had heard from childhood that he resembled DiCaprio.
“I don’t see the uniformity so big, except maybe beards and ticks,” Huffington told the Post.
"He's a nice-looking guy, so I take this as a courtesy."
In the London 2012 races, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were outraged by the uniformity, which is undoubtedly highlighted even more in these races.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been named as the twin-flight of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
Cameron van der Burghi, a South African swimmer, has been compared to Matthew Morrison from the Glee television series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is the "athletic version" of the actor in the film Inception.
Similarly, the uniformity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been noted, which is underlined by the strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova is reminiscent of actress Annalynne McCord, not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and bright hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian is, according to her fans, an "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), are reminiscent of each other’s face shapes and eyes.
Not only that: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the uniformity.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for the pair’s uniformity.
A tweet recently said he was happy when “others on the internet agree on the uniformity of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter.”
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series really are strikingly reminiscent of each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also noticed uniformity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna returns! in the broad smiles of Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologises after saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth in a women's 4 x 200-metre liberating message shocked CBC's live Olympic performance viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost his smell" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Spokesperson Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to open up his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-metre liberating message final.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBC storytelling team to bring the color, was heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg of yours, baby.
He was too excited, he left quickly and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam in the second half of the message at 1:57.79, and was 1.61 seconds behind Canadian Taylor Ruck, which led to the Canadians catching China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language usage of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig???
The idiot didn't realize he was on the show yet."
In the final of the women’s 4 x 200-metre release message, a Chinese swimmer named Ai Yanhania was described in the following words: “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with outrageous comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his resignation.
Twitterers didn’t hold back when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis tweeted: “Wow <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist mob.
Scott Russell, the host of the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's remarks: "We apologize for commenting on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that it happened.”
The CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and pasted its apologies to the comments of more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also issued a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for the fact that they were broadcast.
In yesterday’s broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers and also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday evening, MacDonald apologized in a broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it to be personal.
"I would like to apologize for the comments I made last night after the women's press conference," MacDonald said in a CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Not to mention, it is clear that I did not mean anything degrading in my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, an unhindered woman in the middle of the trade shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when the woman took off in the middle of Primark to fit the panties.
He further exacerbated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his panties, taking them off his leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried four pairs of underpants at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark chain store located in Folkestone’s Bouverie Place shopping mall, where a woman tried panties in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, “People didn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, stripped off her own jerseys and underwear and dressed them up.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but did it completely shamelessly.
Everyone stared as he took off the underpants he had tried and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding that he didn’t like them at all, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the looks – nor did he think of the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had put on.”
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent Town, continues: “How disgusting it is to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn’t washed.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
“I’ve understood that the sales staff tried to remove those pieces of clothing from the sale when the woman had left – which is correct.
It would be horrible to bring new underwear home and notice that someone else has put them on without washing them afterwards,” Davidson added.
A spokesperson for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
How to Defend Against Armed Attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Krav Maga’s New York City-based Grandmaster Rhon Mizrach and asked him for advice on how to survive a swaying predator or abuser.
The video shows you how you can defend yourself against an attacker depending on whether the attacker is approaching you in front of you or behind you.
If the attacker approaches backwards, the first thing you need to turn around to see the attacker and get out of the line of fire, says Mizrachi.
After that, grab the grip so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder joints, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant on his knee, and when he doubles the pain, stab him in the face with a pistol pipe and stab him in the back with the gun pointing at him.
The technique is similar if the armed attacker approaches the front. You have to move away from the shooting line, grab the object and turn it so that the attacker can not be fired.
At the same time, put your weight on the arm and hit the attacker with your fist on the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun targeted at the attacker.
Sounds like trouble?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
However, keep in mind that the safest way to get rid of the robber is by handing over your cash – unless you’re the Krav Maga Grandmaster.
World traveller Ian Wright kisses Europe’s dirtyest spots
The British world traveler put his resilience and reflexes to the hard test by licking Europe’s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk storyteller and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to demonstrate the strength of his resistance by licking the euro banknote, a towel in the Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet rinse button and a Russian general telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminaire to see for himself and to show the viewers what his tongue was pushing to.
The experiment was made into a documentary film by Ian Wright – The Trace of the Inner Power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the rinse button in the train toilet can be disconcerting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing he arrowed caused anything but an evil mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Undoubtedly, licking the railway station hand covers and the rinse button challenged Wright’s resilience.
Wright says in the document: "I've been pretty careless about my health since I was a child and injected into my mouth all kinds of things, like mud, worms, and water."
In the film, he really showed his reputation.
The border was only met in a turbulent public toilet in Russia.
Your luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came to a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to bow when the luminaire measured 4,000 units – the same number in the newly washed hands is less than 60.
In the documentary film Ian Wright, produced with Valio, Wright follows the inner power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any toilet.
4000 units, nothing's dirtyer than that!
The place is so devious that I really don’t lick anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright – The Trace of Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Wright was given Valio Gefil, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacterial stamina and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s category manager for snacks, juices and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We took a lot of time to come up with something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ian to come along."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into wider contact and tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with additional information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor!”
Director Tom Hakala added: “Let’s say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had kissed certain of the objects we asked for, such as the Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, licking some of the items was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I’m glad we got some of the dirty kisses on the tape.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria, especially to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said they used at least occasionally products with lactic acid bacteria added.
Family Destroyed A Town-Owned Rental House In Saltash, Cornwall
The family left behind <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages to the town's rented house after they had received their bail for terroristizing the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been fired from their apartment in Cornwall, Saltash, following numerous complaints against couples.
When the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company said that the apartment was in a state of repair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor slabs were torn off, the rubbish was spilled on the floors, and the walls were carved with graffiti.
The couple have now moved in, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, the head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a nightmare for the people living here, no one should have to endure this.
There is a lot to consider as the property is likely to become known as a less pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is famous, as is the name.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family’s fears included street fights on baseball holidays, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and transmission, and loud screams, quarrels and curses.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received a decree on unsocial behaviour.
In several rooms of the house under the slurry, old waste was found.
Drugs had previously been sold from the farm, and the floor paintings had been torn off.
According to neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency forced the couple to marry this week after first giving them 11 weeks of extra time to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the marriage —they said that their life was an earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived in their neighborhood for 20 years, and that's been a tough time.
The police have been here unbelievably many times.”
“This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we are not used to it!
It’s going to be wonderful now that they’ve finally been fired.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of coercive practices at the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called regularly.
Waste and old toys were thrown on the wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for his own and his family’s behavior, as the resolution is always the last measure the Cornwall Housing Agency considers.
This case was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who participated in the work and offered to give us information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of our neighbours and give the message that unsocial behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after refurbishment
Residential workers now have to clean up the waste bins that are surrounded by the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales and other supplies, and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed the money was for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to move to a private home in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were decorated with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding a restraining order for tenants who violate the rules of leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say this ruling serves as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
“This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they please without accusations, as well as to those who are suffering from such behavior,” Crow says.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and unsocial behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach hippie army shower machine frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion crashed into a staggering low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The photo shows a moment when tourists were in fear of escape when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes close to the sandy beach from sunbathing tourists in northern Portugal’s Aveiro.
The holidaymakers rose to their feet with understandably concern about the noise of the jet engines, which began to be heard before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the holidaymakers who posted pictures and videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It crossed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling to the ground.”
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew in a caged low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight for the purpose of identifying coastal fishing vessels, which is why the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires damaged visibility, but according to the air force this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by the mud fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Outcome of exotics in the first half of the year better than expected
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) achieved a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned in January-June.
The result of the exots was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The guarantee of care was carried out in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the lines of action.
The exote covers the surplus of the previously created deficit.
The remaining portion may be used to shorten the lines and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is projected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exotic Government will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Guardsmen Sworn to Military Sworn in Immol
Seventy of the guards at the Border and Sea Guard School swore an oath on Friday.
The military parade of the guards of the Border and Marine Corps School was held in Immol on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Crossing Course was held at the team’s sports field.
The military took an oath of 70 men.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border guards.
250 of them were invited to the polls.
Specialist border guards have been trained in Immol since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces during the war were involved in the veterans' meeting held in connection with the statehood.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
Draw some rubbish above - criminal investigation helps to find out crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police stations has been operated by an RTA, or Criminal Investigation and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In Häme’s police station, the unit includes a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a lieutenant colonel in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Commander Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civil suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations for the other police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the most recent working methods
The establishment of analysis units is a reform of the most recent police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. that the police would not leave the cellphones until the alarm is received.
The information gathered and analysed by the unit is used to target daily police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal investigation centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a separate criminal investigation unit for each police agency.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Crime Police, is leading the operation nationally.
In the PTR units, according to its name, people work from the Police, Customs and Border Patrol.
The RTA units, in turn, operate in areas divided according to police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both the local police force and the national units.
Inquiry extends beyond your own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police station area.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of your institution, because that is what criminality does.
Workers in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police officers.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminal or reminiscent crimes with the help of registers, alarm databases and observations.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal investigation.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
A handprint can also be seen at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the method of making, the author is made up of a certain kind of image.
The serialization can be done either on the basis of the method or the person depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city collars upright, but their work is not fully public.
There is no mention of both the methods used by criminals, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention efforts.
The police will tell you about the methods publicly if it predicts that they pose a threat.
Such a case, for example, was reported from the beginning of the summer, used in housing burglaries as a way of marking empty apartments.
In it, the makers set up an outside door stick, a button needle, or a piece of tape with which they tested whether the residents were really traveling.
Submissions shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The Analytical Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
For example, the nokleys order a district court protocol, which can show that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, the thieves will wear gloves in their hands.
The case was interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppää of Häme Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola of the Police of Eastern Finland, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve of Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela of the Central Criminal Police.
The police collects and analyzes information that helps to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside of your institution and the borders of Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined her father was killed in Syria.
News reports that one in three British schoolchildren who joined IS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee told the girl's family that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed by Russians in Raqqa, which is the headquarters of ISIS in Syria, ITV News said on Thursday.
The 17-year-old Sultana, according to her family, was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and testament, so that people will understand that this is a real risk to the war zone - and that will cause people to give up the decision to leave," Akunjee says.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East German schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and continued their journey by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and remained a widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid Says Clinton Supports Garland's Appointment to Supreme Court If Elected
Senate Democratic President Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Republicans in the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's appointment after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will select the person to fill the post of former Supreme Court Justice Antoni Scalia.
In a phone call on Thursday, Reid said he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with a lot of certainty".
Reid's spokesperson later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he intended to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not want to “shock the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid says the Republicans who are blocking Garland’s nomination are Donald Trump’s “commanders” and “contributors.”
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are as good for women as they are for men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a calendar made in the style of the 1970s and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of the popular saloon models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, said earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from the old-school Playboy magazines, as he said: “Playboy is for men.
I'll do this to the women."
He seems to think the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, wherever men are, can easily enjoy and be inspired by these feminine images,” Shaw said in a press release.
“Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.”
As a template for your calendar, you can submit your photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write your angry objection in the comment section under the name NoAllSingle Middle-Age Men, this statement is based on actual research data.
According to the YouGov research company, behind the new arrival of much-spoken vinyl records is not the bum of the millennial generation, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead the background of middle-aged nostalgia.
The age of the person who recently purchased a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, 18-24 age groups are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a hobbyist’s desire to grab records, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solo (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog had been a televised newscast, the camera would have followed me as I walked along the bustling Soho Street, wearing a jewel-free grey jacket. I would yell vividly, bend my hand in a cup and say something of the tradition, like, "Let's get clear."
So let's figure it out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rosyness as hotels, Eats, Prets, and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I look very close to the men visiting these stores and try to monitor their age and character quality.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, followed by the Sister Ray movement (as customers at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (as customers at the moment, eight middle-aged men at the end of the day, one probably twenty-one in size)
I'm asking if he's a collector.
“I guess I am,” he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill the wall of his living room, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his available income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to re-purchase things that he was young and moneyless in sales.
“I got a lot of stuff from the late 60s and early 70s that popped up when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them,” he says.
He agrees that buying vinyl records is more likely to be introverts who enjoy with their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much.
It's bad."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers are suitable for the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new kind of human flow that has been affected by media hypnosis. These people have heard of the coming of vinyl records again and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"According to my recent discussions, people had generally given up their collections in places like 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back,” he says.
This may explain the vinyl-based boum of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of sound recordings?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, they realize that they offer a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly annoyed by the contactless payment system.
The digital world may camouflage some of the vinyl fans, returning to familiar record labels means permanence and reminiscent of the lucky days of youth.
“I think that sometimes it fills some gap or material property is acquired for some kind of comfort,” Wez says.
“I see it myself as a collector, and I think so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get ideas elsewhere.”
“We’re like social workers!” whispers Wez’s colleague behind the surface.
An ICM opinion survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the vinyl album purchased last month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also found that 41% have a record player they never use, and 7% of vinyl record buyers don’t have their own record player at all.
At this point, I would probably look like a serious face while browsing the stacked bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl records also involves a "pocalypse phenomenon" observed by the Sounds of the Universe (as customers at the moment three middle-aged men) seller Jonny, 42.
“A customer recently came out and said he doesn’t have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny says.
“The number of such customers is not large, but they do.
Materiality is more important to them than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just starting out on the hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Fopp, which I will be coming to next. The business has dedicated an entire layer to vinyl records.
Clients include 70-year-old couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers will delight, even if the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous moves: the newest synthesizer pop from Wild Beasts, instead of the swaying jazz.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but a palpable psychological trauma is difficult to detect by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and watching various discs on sale.
He’s watching rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so it is not possible for him to collect records.
“They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or something, but the finesse of the wine is ...", he lets the lover breathe and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine jumping jeans, but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment. I see a father and a daughter thinking about buying a Crosley disc player.
On the left is a staircase filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the main records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and part so high that they are not even praised.
They are pure "art vinyl" decor.
But considering that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money to the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there’s hardly any reason to complain.
It is not surprising that the population group that is most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends the most money on luxury items, such as vinyl records.
Although according to my research, YouGov’s results are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which in reality exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be tightly attached to school or work life.
They certainly won’t spend their Thursday mornings painting in Berwick Street’s record stores, browsing through records, and avoiding a 30-year-old TV presenter who stares frighteningly and stares at middle-aged men.
Holkeri or ice shark is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to scientists, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shearer was obtained in the study for 272-512 years. It was a five-meter-long female.
The French court rejected the application for the demolition of the jungle camp shops
A French court has rejected the Calais authorities’ application demanding the demolition of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
The Calais authorities made allegations in court proceedings this week that the state should be allowed to dismantle the 72 temporary trades established for the refugee camp. The shops sell to the residents of the refugee camp by means of a tea shop with a variety of goods from tobacco to energy drinks.
According to Calais's prefectural authorities, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are subject to fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as free meals provided by the state-sponsored organisation and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille’s court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 temporary trader, but considered the prefect’s concerns “totally understandable”.
According to Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla, the camp’s grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have much greater importance than just providing food to people who “live in extremely volatile conditions.”
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet with each other.
One of the places under the landing line was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids café, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of camp’s unaccompanied minors with the most vulnerable status.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address where children’s cafes are required to keep.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, closing it “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that since the sharp increase in the number of wildfires this summer, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record high of more than 9,000.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than the EU average.
Food is getting cheaper in Finland for the pleasure of consumers and for the detriment of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen in Finland to the second most in those EU countries with a similar salary level as in Finland.
In the United Kingdom alone, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is revealed by Ilkka Lehtisen, Statistics Finland’s Development Manager, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the overall evolution of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the price level of 1994.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then came the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year after year.
Now the price is weighed by the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increasing price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, the price contest has been shown as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a haven for low-cost food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland with a similar salary level as in Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the countries had the same VAT rate, the cheapest food would be sold in Finland for the third time in terms of wages from similar countries.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the value added tax rate was seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to get to the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to have VAT halved to the EU average and continue price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen notes that the calculations he made at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
When you return to school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for the schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all secondary schools.
It is an instruction that operates in all schools in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beautiful writing is abandoned, and instead the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies begin to be read at the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of the students.
Previously, it was thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make schooling more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The well-known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the zoo, it is only surpassed by an Icelandic cockroach, whose oldest known individual is dated to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks float along the North Atlantic Ocean.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to surveys, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified adult ice sharks from the 28 females that had remained in the fisherman's catch.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon restriction of the lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters of amazon, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice cucumbers only reach sexual maturity by more than four meters, the researchers calculated that they are around 150 years old at the time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired to nearly 300 - sellers not deducted
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann’s department store company.
The cooperatives in a troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, the majority of which will be laid off," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers of department stores is not reduced so that customer service is not affected.
In addition, about 80 employees of support functions are offered a new job as a salesman.
Stockmann's Yt-Negotiations concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the outset, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at an annual cost savings of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, which are to be realised over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million in savings this year.
The bottom line is Stockmann’s difficulties in making a profit from the warehouse shutdown.
Although the Group’s adjusted turnover improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the goods market is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalais, CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not exceeded the company’s objectives.
“Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive business result in 2018,” Veijainen said in a statement.
The result improvement for the second quarter was mainly based on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved its best second-quarter turnover and earnings of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating profit was 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona L<0xC3><0xA1>ng.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but to the south there will be peat.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the rainy regions of the north, it stays at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletic team rocked by doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's tempo
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in the doping test.
According to the AP news agency, the athlete Anzrah tried to appear in is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
The Kenyan national team's Stephen Arab Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials visited the Anzrah authorities in a statement.
He said Anzrah was sent home because he had "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour,” Kenya’s Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic gymnastics starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich placed fourth in the World Cup last year and is ahead of Rio’s winning favourites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah used an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals at the gym.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid of revealing,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio's All-Athletic Stadium is closing in on its void
Where's everybody?
At least they don't watch sports at the Rio Olympic Stadium.
On Friday in Rio, the fight for the medals in athletics began, but the world’s top athletes were able to present their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio organisers said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day’s morning races and 65% of the tickets for the evening races had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium buzzed about the crowd.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games in Rio have already attracted the attention of viewers before the athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in rugby, melon and horseback riding venues.
When Brazilian medalists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the viewer was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000-seat spectators were full.
At least the bad losses are explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling in economic difficulties, is far from being Europeans and Asian racers, and many of the Olympic species are bizarre for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to fully smuggle the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the organisers, said that 82 percent of tickets had been sold at the time, which is a much lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million remaining items for sale," Andrada told Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold in London, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and army personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not yet allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to lesser-known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball on the sand of Copacabana has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskiasolo competed in London in 2012.
The people in the newspapers were enough.
A New Way to Protect Nature - Acquire Right to Land
The Helsinki Foundation contributes to nature conservation by the newest means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires its ownership of ecologically significant natural areas.
Subsequently, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem ownership rights in the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapis.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by those willing to pay for ownership rights.
The holder receives a veto right for a block of 187 square meters, which means in practice that not every holder needs approval if the purpose of land use is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for multiple blocks.
Acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be inherited or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go carrying banners or hug yourself somewhere in order to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired a management company.
The acquirer of the administrative right receives precise location information from the block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of holders of ownership rights are displayed on the same map where the block information of the land area can be found.
The Foundation sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation will act in some way unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect the natural areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or donating.
It finances its operations mainly by selling ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It is also aiming outside Finland’s borders and is planning to acquire it from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Trade Fair on August 13-19.
Bike thefts are the worst in major cities in Turku - see the situation in your hometown
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the most in Finland’s major cities.
This year, more bicycles have been stolen compared to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on reported bicycle thefts to the police, Helsinki Sanomat found out how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
Well, that's a big difference.
“In other cities, the number of thefts is double in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others,” police inspector Tommi Reen said.
Market police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer to that.
"The prevalence of alerts can be influenced by how much bikes are being driven in the city and how many bikes there are," says Chief of Staff Teemu Ämäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on what are the study and cycling cities.
The market has a dense center, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
“Espoo, for example, is a very different type of city, where the city centres are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, there were slightly fewer bike thefts in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in the past few years, police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
That means 50-60 fillars a day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a criminal record of bicycle theft, although less than one in 10 police reports are made clear.
Typical of the bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also cases in connection with other investigations where, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drugged apartment," Reen says.
Bicycle thieves are arrested in Helsinki on a weekly basis in connection with the crime itself or with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen, for example, from shopping malls’ wheel racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike racks, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually kept.
Like in previous years, the most stolen of the individual bicycle models are the Jopo.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the wheel for their own short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on sale via the net, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not learned that stolen wheels would go abroad very much,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of a cover-up crime or offence.
“The alarm bells should ring if the bike in good condition is sold at a clear low price,” Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special librarian, wears the colourful Nopsana always during his working days to the protectors of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen, says Hirvi. "It has never been taken, it has been a good monk."
"Perhaps this is not so attractive to thieves, there may not be any hypnotic value here," Hirvi, from Helsinki, reflects.
In the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike slammed the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its wheels to something fixed, such as a wheelchair.
“You have to think about it a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says the student of Helsinki about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, such smash-jobs."
A bicycle was stolen from Valve himself from the company's yard a year ago.
The wheel had not been locked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be reassembled.
15-year-olds responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer teams from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer team is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal investigation.
Initially, the trial will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now devoid of criminal liability.
The peer-to-peer team intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer team will discuss with the perpetrator of the crime and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator can join the peer-to-peer team to make up for the crime.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Warfare, says the model is not strict.
We also have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are directed in a more responsible direction so that everything does not go to waste from the first mistake,” says Laitio.
The Peer-to-peer team has taken a model from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first crime, a young person does not face an adult panel, but reflects what has happened with people of almost the same age.
The model has been tested once.
After the experiment, the service design agency Palmu service designer Ikka Lovio says that it was an abuse that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of those under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all.
“It’s been a message to continue on your chosen path,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer team is part of the Helsinki Immigrant Youth Project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and Me-Stiftung.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want the Party to Stop Financing Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a copy of it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee to Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channeled to congressional elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his recklessness, incompetence and record inequalities, threaten to give Democrats a voice in these elections," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds to congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a prominent Republican who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want to protect their party's majority in Congress" and that it is not a endorsement of anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. children's families
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am trying to be president so that the American economy is going well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is striving to be president so that the economy is going well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a statement.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure -- roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The construction program is an extension of the American dunes, who suffer from the move of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-wage jobs since World War II.
We are a building people, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to facilitate the status of working families.
On Thursday, however, he sounded from Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. as a taxpayer, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“[As president] I oppose all trade agreements that act against workers or salaries,” Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program announced by Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for “only favoring such millionaires.”
Trump’s proposal for a sweeping reduction in corporate taxation has previously been called “Trump’s pigtails.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded listeners of small businesses whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making products in America himself,” Clinton tweeted.
These are the Rio viewer numbers: The races have not glued the Finnish ones to the boxes, but the mobile app is interested
Typically, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached any spectators.
Once and for all, the races have glued to the box at their best 12% of the population: Tuesday evening swimming was followed by the Yle Olympic channel TV2 615,000 spectators at the same time.
For comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships attracted a fair second million.
So far, the most interesting of the Olympic games have been the Sunday evening cycling and the fifth day of the competition, which both reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the spectator numbers, and reminds that spectators will be split in several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns are following the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers choose the Olympic Games in general.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting events to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the show comes 24 hours a day, with viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it's a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London or 2008 Beijing, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio’s race broadcasts will come in Finland at night.
The second reason for the interest in the prize - if someone now considers it to be prized - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the original parts, the interest would have been pumped upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other Finnish species of interest: sailing and horseback riding.
At the beginning, the number of viewers was close to expected, according to Pokkisen.
When the sport begins, the spectator numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the races, which rose in the first days of the races as the most free app in the Apple App Store in Finland.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're going to be 200,000 downloads now.
"We'll only get online viewer numbers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena hasn't worked for all users desirable.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the bugs have been repaired.
There has been a delay in the use of Rio Arena and other small technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have received updated versions, which should fix the bugs.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle canals and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can be watched by some species, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts races on a daily basis.
The Olympians are not only perhaps the working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 meters.
It might be even deeper.
Technician diving instructor Matti Kannela found about 20 square meters of pressure in Ristisel, the bottom of which the dive computer looked 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to reinforce the observation by beam scanning.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of one hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi are more than 80 metres away.
They have not been studied as closely as the Day of Judgment.
In particular, the base of the Inari lake has not been accurately mapped.
“There might well be some unknown depths,” Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
From this point of view, your Day cannot reach the deepest ten, and the Summer Water is even further from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 14:29: Fixed the last track where the deepest lakes at their middle depths were wrong.
Retirement Taxes: Retirement Taxes Still Tightened
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the discrepancy came under the parliamentary elections and the pensioners' taxation was promised to be equal to the wage earners.
The Government's proposal does not include such a proposal.
In our opinion, it should definitely be there.
“The promises made should be kept after the election,” he told Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, there were job cuts that eased taxation.
The matter was heated in the parliament by opposition representatives, who charred then-Financial Minister Alexander Stubbi (co.) of the election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalinen, the tax cuts presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpon (co.) are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax cut will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Orpo’s desire to respect the competitive agreement reached with difficulty.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the strength of the social partners, so it should not be challenged.
It is needed because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own faith in the future.
Responsible for long-term unemployment
Ialainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget sector, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will be eliminated.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the promise.
U.S. Ambassador: No Finnish terrorists reported in Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in bombings in Thailand yesterday evening and last night in Finnish time.
The Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists going to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few Finnish people in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The travel season for Finnish Thais is set for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China at this time of the year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target Finnish people in particular in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attack is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of a divided society in Thailand and last week’s referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who said they were against the law.
In Thailand’s southernmost provinces, the ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: strikes are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in a day after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including popular tourist spots in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination also popular among Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require any deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
In the recommended tourist destination in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one of the double bombers died.
In South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is transported to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngin and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of Thailand’s ruling military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not make people panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges the Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns going to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and about their victims.
It's time to get a little more information about yesterday's attack in Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians are among the injured.
At least three people were injured in the last attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the famous bell tower.
Thai PBS says police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, which it believes has found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal worker died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quarterfinals
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russian Alija Mustafina third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the R<0xC3><0xAD>o Championships with permanent, jumping and booms.
Biles has managed women's gymnastics to a certain extent in recent years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the quarter-finals and permanence championships three times in a row, both last and second year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The darker World Cup medals Biles has a jump and a boom.
Thai entrepreneur: "Isuko has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in Phuket, Thailand, has not been concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no further attacks, then I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, estimates Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies experienced in Thailand from close proximity.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these trips have not expelled tourists in the past, hardly this either.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. local time and said that it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beachfront and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning as a result of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were placed because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to the festive Friday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the movements of the main street were allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
Many people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
Halfway through three hours of Thai time in Patong traffic had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, said Huovila, who visited the site.
Later, the car was spotted at the Crown Palace in Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The party found two men who could fit the markings hidden in a nearby six-month-old.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of operating a motor vehicle, theft and serious damage.
The police are grateful for the hints.
Head of research on changes in Russian leadership: a clear move to the sidelines
In Russia, the highest-ranking leadership change took place on Friday, years after President Vladimir Putin resigned his administration chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is a former diplomat and has served as Ivanov's second husband.
The reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has had a quarrel with other executives or has been smuggling.
Ivanoville (disambiguation)
Ivanov, a member of Putin’s inner circle, is moving on to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
In a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the move was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for the transfer to other posts and proposed replacing Vaino, Russia Today said.
According to Kangaspuro, from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear downfall.
In Russia, environmental and transport issues are not of very high priority.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president Dmitry Medvedev.
The paper notes that the old arc, for example governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place is that Putin is changing his immediate neighborhood to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shield as they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Military Council of Manbij.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians have been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Fixed from previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we erroneously reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s line-up on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The courier told STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own lines, but rather on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participations of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of guidance from the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the calendar of the Minister and not in the accounting records.
The head of the Ministry of Communications tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time.
He was injured in his back yard from the start and had to miss the Olympic Games in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better condition.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-waisted samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Around Bolt, Porina points out that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's previous Olympic loss came in Athens in 2004, when he sprinted at the start of the 200 metres in a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed by injuries and a loose workout posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, breaking the world record and the competitor’s confidence despite the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached his career by measuring the clock.
The world record of 9.58 metres in Berlin and 19.19 metres in Berlin is still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second subsidence, but no one else believes in its birth but Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger for Satasella Bolt is the Olympian Justin Gatlin of Athens in 2004.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt beat the American by only one hundredth.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the World Cup, if only he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt fills up in a lot of weeks after 30.
He is an old man in the young men's races, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the world championships in London for the last time in his career.
These are the Olympians that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping Crime
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic trainer was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epohormone.
She finished fourth in the women’s 100-metre butterfly race in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua says that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide had been found in a sample given by Xinyin on Sunday.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya has moved a sports coach from Rio to his home due to a doping crisis.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had behaved in a test situation as an athlete and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, it is a Kenyan high-speed trainer, John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich’s race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps - historic gold came into display style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps, swam in the 200-metre mix in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same kind of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps's winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino placed second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I’m just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in the quick interview with Evening.
The story of Helen Skelton on Monday is one of the most read this week on the website of Iltalehti.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t stress much if there’s a slight tingle in his revealing and special outfits in the som or in the British press.
Television is a visual medium, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short-sleeved dress that has at least enough exposure - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and small bangs are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to tinker and maybe he’s confused, but he stresses that he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are watching sports here, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the tide has risen as far as Finland?
I can't, but all that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how much sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton squirms.
You know what?
It’s a shame if it comes from (the conductor’s) dress.
I'm curious to see if this has hit anyone.
Rio police made two arrests on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said on Thursday they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety of the races.
The police made five other arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All of the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by the police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links to ISIS.
The detainees were known to incite violence on social media.
Violent messages were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of the Rio races is under the responsibility of 85,000 police officers.
Police detonated suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-class match of the Rio basketball tournament in the empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
Police released the package to the public after it had detonated.

The public came in when the police had controlledly detonated the package.
The public did not report to the audience at the start of the match, as the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police exploded the package and allowed the audience to enter the hall only after that.
It was a dreamy start to the Spanish team.
With two losses the races started by Spain won Nigeria points 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain won silver.

Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty spectators.
Argentine lady stabbed Petäjä-Sirene - Finnish thought about protest
The wind of Petäjä-Sirene had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind was heavy on Thursday.
The Argentine lady slammed the Wind Pepper-Siren on Thursday in Rio on the opening day of the Women's Surfing Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant conceded the breach.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others fled, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete has long considered protests.
This was not to be done because it would have been in vain under the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund, Pete-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his table until the last time because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
The Finn was in 27th place after the accident.
In total, the 2012 London Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
With regard to the car, the accident did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day when there is a race on departures 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first knowledge, Pete-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things That Science Says Will Extend Life
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring extra years into a person’s life.
Some of the things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that their life lengthens.
Sometimes again, things that the person himself cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include, among other things, the tendency to middle-class obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don't always have to fry - just getting a milkshake is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored by a number of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest results of the study.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beef and coffee
Coffee production has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially with neurological or heart disease.
There are studies in favor of alcohol that suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that winemakers lived to be older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can prolong a person’s life by up to six years, one study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents meningitis.
In turn, they can help to erupt other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway found how laughter affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be alive after the trial ended.
Sex, when it comes to protecting against sex diseases, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex on its own is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Exercise, of course, will bring extra years, there is no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute coherence.
In fact, a study by the University of Oxford found that women with a large backside had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality rates.
Whether it’s an Olympic medallist athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bully.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings extra years to his life.
Some researchers, in turn, suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which, in turn, allows, for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study investigating shopping behaviors in people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, or less likely to be a parent shopping.
This is due to the fact that in concrete trades spinning reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that could precipitate death.
So, put your credit card out of your hands - online shopping therefore does not have the same effect.
Drunk driving drunk slammed into truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crash took place in Koskola.
The accident occurred in Koskela, in the middle of Koskentia and Sorvastonti on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car encountered had been driven on the same strip, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained upright after the crash, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car sat down in a straight line and from there I ran over the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the University Central Hospital in Turku.
The result of the woman’s bloating test was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of a heavy wheel intoxication.
Post sent debris to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket’s discards range had shortcomings because the mail had delivered some of the cargo accidentally to Maueräjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying discards from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortages in the dismantled ones, because the Posti delivered our cargo to Wandäjoki!
We will get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
So if you don't pack in the lawn mower, you read the sign.
The trader’s waving sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowers.
Grass cutter is always on offer by Post until the end of August.
In his opinion, the poster was mostly fun and he decided to share it on social media.
I was struck by the popularity of the update.
Even media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention on this matter is unbelievable, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Halsia got her own favorites caught in a discard bag, even though a few drawers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the Transport Services of Posti Companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five scenes went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but only today we brought five scenes, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was first reported by the Evening Sayings.
Teija Halt did not get bored with the sign because she found all of her discarded favorites in the selection.

The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Victim’s Memories for Police Dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered by donating flowers and addresses to a police dog.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update, in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked at the Veterinary Station in Sipoo as a substitute and also had a nurse training there.
The veterinarian's office remembers the words touching the woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless work.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation funds go in full to police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safe dogs.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkyla.
Neighbors of the woman have told Eventaleh that the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and cats.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and they had no contact with each other.
A police dog named Börje was involved in the search for the killer, who was injured in a life-threatening arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
District Court Sentenced to Post for Violation of Equality Act
The Post did not have the right to detain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the hired worker, Kanta-Hämee County Court in its judgment.
The District Court required Posti to pay the majority of the detainee’s salary and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgement, the Posti could have detained only a part of the employee’s salary that accounted for the share of the employee’s day-to-day work.
According to the District Court, an employee was placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the organisational decision of the Postal and Logistics Union PAU on the prohibition of familiarisation.
During last November’s post office, the PAU made a decision that the Post’s employees did not familiarize themselves with strike-breaking hire workers.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey must return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalistic Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a previous letter, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilas and Soini to express their concern for Turkish freedom of speech and the press.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly pointed out to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of speech.
Putin Resigns His Commander-in-Chief to Replace Estonian-style Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has separated the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
Anton Vaino, son of Karl Vaino, the Communist leader of the Soviet-Estonia, will be replaced.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
He will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency said.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to a Kremlin press release, Ivanov, a close insider of Putin, is shifting to special tasks in environmental and transport affairs.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other positions and proposed replacing Vaino, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union on the spying of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin’s re-election to the presidency in 2012.
BBC: ManU's Giant Procurement for Game Ban - Not Seen at Opening of the Premier League
The world record holder of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off on the weekend.
Paul Pogban's pelikielto is accompanied by England.
Manchester United's Paul Pogba is on the sidelines because of a game ban when ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million fee for Pogba to Juventus, according to the British media.
However, the Football Association of England (FA) kept him out of the game, as Pogbal was under pressure from Juventus.
He received two warnings last season in the Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
The ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, bigotry is a virtue.
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of the entertainment have established the status of the Flow Festival as an internationally recognized event, which is highlighted by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festive hikers have typically expressed themselves with their own peculiar outfits.
One of the main artists is this year’s punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival is stalled with art galleries and art installations, among others.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main platform and a bowling alley,” says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
This weekend’s Flow Festival in Helsinki’s Suvilah has grown from a small street festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The key to success is a simple question: What kind of event would the actors themselves want to go to?
It is quite different in event productions to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was coming to an end this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5 000 people last year.
This year, the festivals will also feature a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to finance it in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle ranch, which is driven on huge roads.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has swelled, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars in the partially artificial area.
In addition to the main platform and smaller playgrounds, this year there will be tents for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bigoted, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow alive.
If it disappears, this is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done by Kalli is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-twentieth century, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of around 20,000 euros.
Last year, the company operating Flow had a turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
With it, you can achieve "circular things" such as the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own peculiar outfits.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all in terms of content.
However, fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow’s value world: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main performers is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indie rock, pop, rap and sound.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booed because this is probably the last time this will be seen in Finland.
We care about everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is fucking good and he's done some fucking good things in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower box and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreign customers.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet correctly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists in Hua Hin.
People ran up to me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened at one of the biggest bars, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Shortly thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, favoring the Finns.
I don't think anyone's dead.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In Trang, a bomb exploded.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings, which are not happy with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently become involved in the activities of criminal organizations dealing with trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new ready forces will go to battle first in case of war
In the event of an acute situation of war, the armed forces are not ordered to carry out combat duties until several months after taking an oath of war, says the Central Finn.
According to the head of training of the Defence Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnisen, who served for 5.5 months in wartime, only those who are in the final stage of their training are eligible for combat.
According to the training manager, the service will be assigned first to the reserve personnel belonging to the paramilitary forces.
No armored personnel or reservists are ordered to carry out a task that has not been given the required training, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin to train the armed forces to the units of immediate readiness from next year.
Units may be used in military operations already during the training of the armed forces, if necessary.
Pamela Tola gets huge compensation from hometale
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, Pauli Waroma, have won a fierce dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-storey apartment was EUR 330,000.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a dangerous microbial plant to health.
The couple had to sell their apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to 132,000 euros, so the economic loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to 198,000 euros.
The couple brought the case to court and demanded a price cut from the seller there.
The seller disputed the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both district and court.
The court handed down the case on Wednesday.
It remained in effect with a judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of 47,344 euros for the trial and settlement costs of the couple.
The right reasonably reduced the price slightly, because some of the need for repair of the apartment had been known to the buyers already when making the house trade.
However, according to the Court of First Instance, the errors in the construction were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought good-quality homes because they did not want to do repairs.
He had been given the idea that the building had been fundamentally renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the fitness inspection report.
The audit report referred to ventilation as risks and mismatches and the inadequacy of the management of rain and melting waters along the rock surface.
However, it was not clear from the discussions that this would have been an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma came to the idea that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little in a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 in the building identified microbial plants, which, according to witnesses, were due to both the rainwater of the rock and the capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air polluted by the microbes, according to the inspector's estimate, could also enter the interiors through the window.
In the samples of brooms, the cellar staircase, the window opener in the living room and the basement washroom, allowing for a risk of health, excess of the limit values were found.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of Espoo’s decision to make changes to the apartment prior to the commercialisation.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
Home issues, however, were a key issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for large-scale repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma considered that there was no special reason for a larger inspection than usual.
The buyers have not failed to comply with their reporting obligations, the Court of First Instance states in its judgment.
Karmish archival: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent Dagens Nyheter article that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has documented a total of 218,500 women who wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to marry the Nazis.
The documents and registration cards are issued by a breeding agency based in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency was under the leadership of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted on women to find out.
The racial agency investigated the backgrounds of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The race agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-lovers", "saving", and "good national socialists" who knew German very well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The case does not tell how the 14 Finnish women who were found in the archive documents were treated.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program stipulated, among other things, that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside.
The Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program has not been actively promoted, according to the pages of the US Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazis’ population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage expenses by offering loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of the German mother was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.
Sixth of the Traitor Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the sailing on the first departure of the Finnjolli day at the Rio Olympics, but remained a full-fledged peak on the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall position after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him in place of 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures in 17th and 3rd places.
In the overall situation, Pete-Siren is sixth.
In the 470th grade, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren stayed at the start of the day instead of 23.
In total, the Lindgrens are at number 19.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded at night for a couple of hours: "I was so horny"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favorite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has become the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dances and festivals, still manages to pound and is currently on the rise.
A book written by Mari Koppisen, about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career, both good and bad.
Brillanpää’s career rose to full praise when he won the crown of Tango in 1995 at the Seinäjoki Tango Market.
In Kissa Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed for Bridgenpää a tango piece, which was adapted by Kassu Halonen in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it to the tape in a terrible crawl and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so fucked up!
The bridge remembers in the book.
From the recording of the song, which became a huge hit, it would not be immediately assumed that it was sung in a crib.
Although I was not physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that I don’t always have to demand perfection and perfection.
The second incident related to the most popular songs of the man, which the book tells about, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his partner at the time and the case eventually ended with the lyrics of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered by Saara Törmäsel were not as Sillanpää would have wanted.
Brillanpää had imagined he was doing a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song telling the difference were not true, but it was written based on the 7 days magazine news.
The newspaper's news report reported Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol use as the reason for Jari's separation from his ex-girlfriend, but Jari said it was full of dolls and was not true.
According to the book, Jari played the record company in anger and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting for their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls during the voting week predicted the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of staying in the EU.
Not a single prestigious research institution or university endorsed the distinction, although a couple of individual researchers may disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” is the basic mantra in Western politics, flying into a mudslide in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Category: Economic grammar
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics (CMC) has received responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand economics.
Many still have the notion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it is out of the UK.
Many also have the idea that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economic Committee, voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus among economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly shaken by the BBC’s fairness, which gave as much space as a few percent of the EU’s economy to economists who are in favour of the difference than to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capitalist combinations think about the consequences of the disparity.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economists’ messages were both heard and understood, they were not cared for because economists represent an elite with which voters do not in their opinion have common interests.
Academics in large cities such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overriding winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant robs your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees in it.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
There are immigrants in the waiting room of each health centre.
How much easier would it be for the British to have doctors if there were no doctors?
There are immigrants’ children in every school.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they were to get rid of them?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would there be for the early settlers if they were to disappear?
In my opinion, these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them, and if they did, their responses would not be visible.
Economists have failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepared for Brexit in Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investments by the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
In Aberdeen, he said, it was timely to prepare for Brexit by drafting plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the camp for the EU-different, began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have measurable liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit occurred on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only daily open-ended real estate fund covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is about <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or below 10%.
As a result, real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The Funds Closed Trades
When the camp for EU disparity won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
And then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, president of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen their trading.
These together looted the situation and put it in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous about it.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund had to close its doors one by one.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it was also eventually forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old one, they did not actually close the trade, but instead changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be withdrawn in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Mainland European Funds have not had any similar fluctuations.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unreasonably Attention to Real Estate Funds
According to the old one, the closures of real estate funds’ trades received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds, which were covered by the closures, control about 4% of British property.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold off less than ten properties from 80 of its London-based properties.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may be holding back its funds in the middle of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been pushed down, but the situation does not appear to be "sleeker" for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities for some of the real estate investors, notes Vanhanen.
The pound/dollar price is at its weakest for 30 years, plus a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
You can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, says the old man.
Brexit brings downsides to London’s real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem very strange.
But at 4 p.m., when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investment at the UK real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this is going to plan B now, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The city of London was still alive in the morning.
TVs normally set to be silent in the office were buzzing the news, and usually the loud crowd was silent to listen completely as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell them about his departure.
When the market opened, the display ends blinked only in red.
It was a morning that he would never have thought he was alive, says Vanhanen.
Not that despite the blizzard, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mess.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Begins Correction Movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership switched.
Markets were beginning to predict sharp downturns in the UK and especially London real estate market.
Up to 20 per cent minus were forecast for London office space in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one by one.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the tortoise has dissipated, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer vacation this week in Helsinki.
It is still far too early to say much about what follows from Brexit.
So much is still open: how does the difference occur and how does Scotland react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
The information provided by CBRE on price developments covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City’s office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, according to Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't so terrible, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was started to be published in 1987, and in just five months there have been worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman’s collapse and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks the comparison is not quite appropriate, because it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The feeling is also different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that at the time, but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The money is also found normally.
The remedial action could have been in the forefront anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle to him - one could have been in the forefront without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started from a very high point.
London’s prices have dropped upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalizing, says Vanhanen.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players on the market, and an increasing number of institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced, for example, pension companies to look for yields from new items.
On this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt levy has been used, according to Vanhanen, now clearly less than during the boom preceding the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price rises stabilized last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten his possessions in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of transformation to be expected, and now it's coming.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to estimate much of the future, but says that no climbing peak is allowed.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a declining or steady outflow in front.
The old man has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the cube is solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you’ve invested in one market, there’s too much of it.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register purchase information more accurately than before
At S Group, you know what you’re eating, as the trading group said today it’s starting to collect more detailed information about its stock customers’ purchases.
Once information has been collected on the final amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it in early May for the products purchased as well.
The S-Group is following Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala tells the Economist.
According to him, Kesko will not respond to the S-Group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its stock customers into ten groups based on their food purchases alone.
The classification is updated on a monthly basis.
Position customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from K-Group’s own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil will not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-alone client program and is not planning to do so.
Finnish Local Market has its own Ykkösbonus stock customer program, which can be joined in Election Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information on product or product group levels, we remain at the level of the final amount of the invoice.
That is, we know where the purchases were made and the day I and the final invoice of the customer.
We have not gone to the same level as the K-group or the S-group, says commercial manager Anu Ora.
According to him, the stock-customer programme is planned to be renewed in the future, but Nairobi will tell about it later.
Ora, however, does not allow the registration of product information to begin.
First of all, experimentation
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
The basic data included not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, housing, and the years of birth of the child and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, location, final amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded from S-Etukartsostost.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will begin to be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, in S-markets, Prismo, Kodi Terro and ABC, data is currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Owner and Partnership.
The S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored on the cash registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
Halukas can check its stored data on the S-Group website.
For example, cash registers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-Puppy is the newest dog reinforcement of the Customs - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
A black labrador retriever’s puppy sniffs five similar boxes in a row at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It doesn’t take long to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite game.
From the box next to which Haila sat, a can of scented shells were revealed.
“Food gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila,” says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce reasons for access
Heila is the first dog to specialize in the search for weapons and explosives of the Customs and will be deployed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if needed.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels triggered measures in the Customs and after the attacks control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, a customs inspector.
Another reason for training a gun and explosive dog to the duties of Customs is the mailings through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With the increase in e-commerce, up to 40 million mail shipments per year pass through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, at Helsinki-Vantaa airport, the customs authorities have made discoveries about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their source materials related to online shopping, passenger luggage and air cargo.
Heila will be working in various parts of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will examine the checked baggage and postal shipments.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on her performance, Tulli assesses whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
Kirkkonummi School
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also trains with Heila at the police and Defense Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantaa are Tull’s six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador breeder Heila has been selected from the puppies of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include ripping and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The sublime orders go to Heila from one to the other.
The Night-Sanomi cameraman loses the protection of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the protection that looks like a soft toy immediately from the "switch" command.
Strict competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still equal opportunities ahead, next in October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work.
Heila can be seen working in Helsinki-Vantaa next half of the year, if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron work suits for a dog on it, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire from the care of their owner.
Work days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs has a lot of competition in customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to be the owner of the ship.
Luck hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs as well as monitoring duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
Fiji’s Olympic gold medal in rugby is so high in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
The day of leave will be held on the following day when the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the heroic team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that the final in the country was followed in the capital Suvala, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijis are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Dramaaa in Rio - Finnish buyer turned around after great performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt of 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after severe lifts, he has been swollen many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from pushing in Rio and 145 kilos from tapping.
His total score was 320 pounds.
Tokola finally tried to gain 175 kilograms, as well as his second.
In the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of a loud scream.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The joy of the Finnish rider was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Weikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men’s football league, has signed a long-term contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player in our team who has strengths and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went with more than ten player agents through an abundance of 50 players from all over the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn’s Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovanians will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new striker when last season's goalkeeper Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The Threatening Modern Family Star Reveals: Teenage Star Shorts Reveal Nearly Everything
Ariel Winter, best known as Alex Dunphy in the Modern Family comedy series, once again smashes his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also this asshole.
18-year-old Winter has recently gained attention by changing his style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has posed in his social media posts in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen dressing in very narrow clothes.
On the threshold of adulthood, Winter has also recently released several pictures of himself at the party.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more the surface appears, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has angered some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the bottom is already so hard, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Instead, some of the women’s fans defend the actor and urge them not to give in to criticism.
You look great!
It doesn't matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, glowing young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the revolut: in autumn it is possible to see the random mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start the rafting tours in early autumn, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main tourist destinations of the Japanese are Inari and Levi.
Revontulets are the master cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter rafting trips are in high demand, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
It is not known that the saplings begin early in the autumn and continue into the long spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the thunderstorms, making the vision twice as random, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of the Revontula campaign in Finland are wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of traveling and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land view among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would want clearer unique sights from Finland, and Lind says the revolt has enormous potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased in Finland significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for tourism in Finland, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in the Rugby 7 race when the Fiji championship team won gold
Britain’s impressive success in seven-player rugby was briskly interrupted by Fidzi’s victory in the finals at Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday with a score of 43–7.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball-handling, transfers, side-running, support play, running lines, and raw, and thus won gold – if the country was the first Olympic medal in its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a bit thinner than comfort for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic team in the first time rugby-7 tournament where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tight win of the South African Boxes in the 7–5 semi-finals earlier that day could have a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-man team had been in full force.
Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one British player will receive a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby union coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite good for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens in Ryan's coaching.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss is painful, but the progress is staggering.
Fidzi started off perfectly and introduced his background skills to the UK as a hobby.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had crashed into a crowd of moving buses, and the world champions took the lead 5–0 when Osea Kolinisau made the plunge into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai made the second goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The situation was 12-0, and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s magnificent backlash prevented the skewed Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it did not slow Fidz’s departure long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Blutemeu scored in the right corner, after which the United Kingdom lost 17–0.
Nakarawa made the second goal from the follow-up goal, with the first half time still more than a minute left.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvou fell through the weaker backs of the British team and fell over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in a situation of 29-0.
It seemed as if the Fiddlers were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the genre as a pupil.
Which is pretty much true.
The United Kingdom made large changes in the half-time and managed to hold the Fijis for a total of four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored the goal thanks to the Fijis’ excellent team play.
Dan Norton managed to shorten the situation 36–7 by scoring Britain in the left-hand corner, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea archipelago, whose fans sang, waved the flags and danced.
Fidz’s purely joyful attitude was hard to ignore.
Mata Viliame made the final order for the Fijian cake by painting at the last minute.
The pill sounded, the Fijis hugged each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had won Japan's semi-finals by 20–5 and Britain had pulled past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was solved by a British goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and fell under scoring poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony Watson of England's 15-player rugby team, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach’s fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to beat gold
More emotional than that, gold could not be in these races.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning made 220 winning bets on history and found an added purpose for their golden moment at Estacio da Lago.
Even though they were two in the aisles, the third voice of coach Robin Williams was heard in the boat, which encouraged them to enter their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles. This makes them the first women in British sports history to boast of a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undisputed, the victory was already 39th in a row and once again a record.
What we see, the two brilliant athletes connecting the surface of the water as you age, does not fully correspond to the nature of success.
Behind each soutukula there is a large set of helping hands, each of which has taken two towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach, who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know then if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes my mind a little bit.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that Williams was able to start his treatment off-season at the beginning of 2014, where the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if now in such circumstances can even be said.
“I needed the money, so I had to get better quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
Soutu itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the victory, the twin’s thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more than normal in trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who was behind the tour of Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been at a level of awareness this week in ruins, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked together with Helen and Robin.
The last three years in Helen and Robin's box office have been fantastic.
Without Robin we would be nothing, so a big thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The duo have found a superior rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw comparisons.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very close in a moment.
Helen og "Stay involved, stay involved".
It is very important not to get out of the way.”
“We did well in leaving, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything wonderful.
We didn’t reach the skies today, we just wanted to do a good show and win the race we did.”
The couple thinks a year before deciding their future.
Next month, Glover celebrates her wedding to Steve Backshall, a celebrity from nature television.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure.”
“After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to understand.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland Replaces Government With Panama Leakages
Iceland is holding early parliamentary elections in October, which were already called for by protesters angered by Panamanian data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians have circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the last-ditch anger of the people will affect the results of the autumn elections.
In the June presidential election, criticism of the overwhelming was clearly seen, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump Says He's Sarcastic in Claiming Obama to Be the Founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has rescinded his most recent shortcomings.
She said she was sarcastically asserting that President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and a participant in the founding of the organization by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
“You should never let anyone who can sink around like that into the army chief,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of Muslim-favoured burqin swimsuits on beaches, the British newspaper The Guardian reports.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swims for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which in large part express religious ties, may increase the risk of order disturbances in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove a crowd to celebrate French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist men linked to Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the swimming waters in the Oulu region passed through the saw - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the shores of Pyykösjärvi, blue-brown sesame has been observed.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu region’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniem Beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococci bacteria in all bathing waters of the bathing waters were below the limits of the measures provided for in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E. coli and enterococci concentrations of the bathing water in Meriniem were determined on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue-green sediment found on the shore of Lake Pykösjärvi does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green sediment, forming blue-green plates on the surface of the water.
The environmental action monitors the situation closely with inspections.
In the event that the blue-tailed sesame becomes blue-tailed, this shall also be separately reported on the beach notice board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkaraine Forest Gift Reduction: Over 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s proposed budget next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of a generational change of forestry tax.
In the presentation of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest donations has four objectives: to promote the generational change of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of trees.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest farms is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forest Producers (MTK).
However, the hacker finds a critiqued tax bill.
The Forest Gift Reduction shall be assigned to the net capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions are deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarien, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The VM’s proposal is based on a reduction in the net income of forestry to prevent the loss of income from forestry, which should be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit, even if there is no wood to sell.
The calculation model is quite complex.
The average forest owner can’t figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The limit for the tax reduction linked to the forest’s yield value is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 000.
I think it's been dragged too high.
As such, it eliminated 82 percent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction, he said.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
In the VM it is considered that the boundary guarantees the objective of the cultivation.
According to Hakkarien, the reduction of forest grants has been achieved in forest policy for decades.
Its background is the aging of forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful turbulence surprised the drivers at Himanga - two cars crashed into each other
On Friday morning, there was a special run in the Himanga river.
According to the rescue department, two cars in a row fell in a straight line, after which the rear came into a collision with the front driver.
According to Harri Pyyhtä, a daytime firefighter, the current suffocation is suspected to have been caused by a strong crack.
In the back of the car, two people were transported to the hospital.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the previous vehicle was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent research results of researchers from the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings made by the research group of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumour increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to the cancer cells.
The results were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhoks family murder continues in court, prosecutor demands murder conviction for another perpetrator
The murder of Muhoks continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the family murder committed in Muhoks.
The other was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months, including murder as a young person and gross robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder as a young person and for gross robbery.
He was also sentenced to death for jeopardising road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle as a young person.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecutor is demanding a lesser sentence on a man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full comprehension at the time.
According to the district court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a school child protection officer in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked a driver sitting on the sofa in the living room.
The conductor had escaped from the extract and put the young man in his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the conductor was wired, beaten and kicked to the head.
According to the state of mind study, both convicted were in full comprehension at the time of the crime.
According to the law, the young people had planned to flee the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the world’s longest-lived vertebrate, only growing at 156 years old
Ice sharks have been confirmed to be the world’s longest living vertebrate, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the holker can live up to 400 years.
The female only grows at the age of 156.
The lifespan of the iceberg adds to the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one snail is known to live longer than an ice shark.
The researchers found out the age by radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need another world.
Even a third of all tax revenues in the country would be lost if the change to corporate tax, driven by Donald Trump, is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by the most beneficial tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would drop from 35 percent to 15 percent.
There would be a huge amount of money, $1 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s cut of 33.
Inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump has accused the state of overregulating the business sector and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards adopted by hurricanes must be recast and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be reopened.
The government must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, “destroying” trade policy is one of the major causes of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be waived.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 per cent and a 35 per cent penalty tax on Mexico.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our religion,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, American planes are going to connect cities, American ships are going to control the seas, American steel is going to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
In contrast, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists – including those close to Republicans – see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program on early Friday in Finland.
A wave of storms from the past - People's News
The sea is ravaging fatefully, but a real storm strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street line – whether the account of the past can begin.
It summarized the story of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s novelty.
Almodovar’s previous directing work The Travellers (2013) was a small-sized satirical comedy, preceded by Skin in which I live the peaks of a (2011) Spanish tour career.
Levelly Julieta (2016) is somewhere between those two works.
It is a peace-loving, human-relations- and family-relations-chakra at the heart of which is the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and can be seen as a long backdrop.
Life seems to be modeling for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new friend (Dario Grandinetti) must always be in wonder until the end of the film.
In the form of a backpack and a long letter, Juliet recounts the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Juliet as a young teacher, appears in the second female part of the television series The Time Between Ommeltes (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a kitchen, but I would say that time was weak and verbally one-off.
For Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, there is often a fair distance from Juliet to such an ingenuity, always with humor.
It is an evenly played, restrained, a place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish conductor is there and in such a way that it begins to inject a little silently into the eye more as a pure form factor than a functioning dramatic effect.
The characters of the film experience illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same as Korean.
This is especially true for the costume: in the case of the character, the costumes vary from scene to scene, and the same applies to the striking earrings.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main thing is that the arrangements of the scene at that time are not particularly relevant.
When mechanically repetitive, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a screenplay based on three novels by Canadian novelist Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Tales.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced literary filming.
The subject matter would have been emotionally incomparable to a stronger drama, so many big things - especially a palpable guilt - the theme of the film is addressed.
Directed and scripted by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premiere is 12.8.
Government is trying to run for election - People's News
No new cuts are being made, the Ministers say, so that the Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are made in the rag trade.
There will be no further cuts.
The already decided savings of 4 billion is sufficient.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (co.) under the budget line.
This is true in the light of the fact that there are no further cuts in the draft of the VM, as social security cuts were decided already in the spring frame.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be reduced by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment insurance will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training cuts continue.
Municipalities are haunting
Why do the ministers stress the very fact that no further cuts are being made on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipal elections are held in April, and they are the most important indicator of the election season, not the gallups.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the municipal elections leading in different directions will ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
The Gallupi, however, say that the Finnish government party expects a slump loss, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Finns received 752 new delegates, many of which will realize the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life span of three governments of roughly the same size is dependent on the fact that the canvas of the Finns will last.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party who voted had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation have also come to the surface.
First of all, the rhetoric does not obscure the fact that next year they will be carried out vigorously, and secondly, they will try to soften the upcoming attack on the Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of folding the debt in this term, but Petteri Orpo’s draft budget will take on debt next year 5.9 billion euros, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: debt is not slowed down or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means new even tougher cuts on the former in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be at least close to equilibrium during 2018 and then, in the spring, what is to come will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
With these actions, there is no debt.
It is quite clear that with current actions, there is no debt, although Juha Sipilä tries to inflame the positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe at the Budget Disclosure Event prove it indiscriminately:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal from the international economy.
Finland’s economy has barely risen since its collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over the past decade, extending from an average of 34 weeks to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäi, public debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the next half-decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief presented by the leftist union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion, which will be covered practically by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the perception of the centre, the assembly and the Finns of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of work to the city
Three out of four consider that the organization of child day care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also pass on responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic institutions, building control, high school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is most clearly expressed in the areas of provincial development, special care, vocational training, vocational colleges and institution care for persons with developmental disabilities.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities is intended to be transferred to the state.
Underage drunk driving driver runs behind the scenes after police flee
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu fled the police force in Joensuu on Friday night at half an hour.
The police tried to stop the motorcycle without the lights, but the young man went to drive the police to escape with a fair speed.
The trail continued to Sonkajanrannanti, from where it continued to Sorronahontia and to the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove off the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed policeman ran to catch the runner.
The driver’s breath test showed 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driver’s license to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, inter alia, as a serious risk to road safety.
A truck in the quarry crashed.
A truck in Kivilastas crashed at Polvijärvi on Kaavinti on Thursday night at 21.15.
The train had drifted out of the road in a left-hand corner and fell towards its side.
The rescue team pulled the injured driver out of the crashed hole through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter's staff and first responders.
It was the responsibility of the car owner to lift the vehicle.
From the fallen shrimp, hydraulic oil flowed into the road, which the rescue team absorbed into the oatmeal.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Ilmajou
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoi village in South Pohjanmaa.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters long, slim and horny with white hair under her chin.
Observations and hints of missing movements are requested to call Pohjanmaa Situation Centre's reference number 0295440513.
Materials of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest ruins
The flooding of the tents of the Parafest festivals caused massive destruction.
Arto Pippuri, president of the Joensuu Parafesty Association, estimates that the festival will be financially rewarded, and the event can also be organized next year.
The last performance of the Parafest Kalle Salonen took place at the end of Friday evening on the torilla.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the premises of the City Theatre starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1pm to 3pm.
The program is being planned.
A downstream flow occurs in a cloud of clouds when rainwater and its weight trigger a falling airflow.
Changes in the state of the cloud of water bind heat, and therefore the falling air cools and accelerates its speed towards the ground.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, there are a number of falls in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the downpour.
The downpour hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell to the ground, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly injuring themselves.
Among them was one child, who was transported to follow-up treatment with a slight injury.
Air Pollution Aging in London
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is ageing faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The study is based on the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than, say, a colleague living in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are a very fine dust contaminant, which is derived from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 people in London each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk especially for those in London who go on business trips walking near crowded streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with a variety of masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular cleansing of the skin.
Tractor brakes betrayed a man standing in front of you
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man did not get under it, but the tractor managed to reach a man so empty that he was transported to the central hospital for further examinations seriously injured.
The tractor couldn’t go any further because it hit the stones in front of it.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Champions League of Volleyball, will start the series in October with better starting points than men’s.
The team has been around for almost three weeks.
The common tune is certainly better found than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team for being entrepreneurial and unified.
Fred Musoni from the foreign trio starts his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-cent hacker.
Garchet is a passerine, the Brazilian is 198 centimeters tall.
Josban, Kataja and Jokiboys to the U.S. National Team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all of the World Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere are already going for its sixth race, only in 2013 missed Canada being better in the North American races.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy national team.
I was interested and here it is, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species has not yet been played at the SM level as a salibandy.
The ball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipoj in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university in the SM-series of the 1991-92 season, the next three passes passed in Josba.
While playing, he trained the A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series 10 times, the balance was 169 games 51<0x2B>34<0x3D>85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, a native of Finland, was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Republic’s Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old striker in Helsinki, has played this before six men’s landscaping, with a total of 9<0x2B>4<0x3D>13 points.
The 32-year-old defender of Switzerland’s Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a travel problem and is part of the standard team’s 117 fielding experience.
Mika Kohonen, a coach of the Seinäjoki Peliveljie, was also named to the national team, which was last seen in the Finnish shirt at the World Cups last December.
The head coach of the Salibandymaa team is the Kontio Bayer Petri Kettunen.
Beach volleyball club Essi Hasun circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize drawer
Essi Hasu is about to retire as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be held this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
Within three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Volleyball Association and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the top six pairs in each series ranking.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäne NMKY, who has been among the Finnish beach volleyball tops for several years.
Today in Helsinki, Hasu is eagerly awaiting games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the show this weekend.
It's definitely going to be a great arena for the wash.
I haven’t played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu said.
The area of Kouvola lit up Hasun’s spark for sport and gave good vibes for a great hobby.
There are many memories of childhood in my mind.
When I was 9 years old, I started flying ball in E-girls at Elimäen NMKY.
The most important thing in mind is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that are rotating in the ankles, as well as amazing ascents and choreographies after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other.
The team’s collective spirit created an environment in which it was nice to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of a teammate coached us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was a natural choice as a counterweight to the indoor flight ball as a junior.
The beach at Kurrälamme has been playing baits since the 1990s.
The user has always been active.
I also went to the Junior SM Tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkisen in the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-placed double in the tournament is clear.
Realistically, we have a medal.
The SM gold is still missing from the prize drawer, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasul’s last in front of a well-known audience.
At the beginning of September, there will be new challenges in civil service.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toenails are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Crash flow dropped tents for disabled people in Joensuu, major accident was close

Solomon Koli bravely went on to become a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweating and inertia.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli soon started working with his little brother Valtteri Koli as a successor to their home state two years ago.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting out as a rural businessman meant borrowing and increasing to the farm so that bread could be taken over by agriculture.
This has been my business since I was a kid.
I’ve always loved the farm, and now that I’ve started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself went really bravely into the project and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything is still going well.
The goal of Salomon Koli, a meat truck grower, is to invest in an even bigger nave.
The work has produced results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the magazine Rural Future.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest in many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since last October, when the country announced a positive inflation rate of 0.2 per cent.
The CPI measured average annual inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 per cent compared to December 2015 per cent) the inflation rate has been –0.2%, and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, prices of the following consumables groups increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and periodic maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as last month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticized as an Asian Caricature
Snapchat says it was an anime that inspired the filter, but some observers think it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identities in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unfinished, feature-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All the steps of deception will quickly come to the public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have received criticism where it has been accused of favoring blackface make-up or bleached skin tones as a beauty gesture.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into whimsical, distorted teeth and made pussy pulls, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts referred to the larger problem that the company has with the difference.
The news and anger spread widely on Wednesday, and it was written by the online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly disputed the anime comparison.
A Korean-American art student, Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely shared, said in her email that the lens was "at least offensive and annoying".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the equivalence of a very tasteless Asian curry to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one that is taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat isn’t the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it is recognized that there is an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience is made up of young people who are more diverse from ethnic backgrounds than their parents’ counterparts. This can mean that they are likely to expect subtlety even more.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends a user, these kinds of things are no longer as easily overlooked as they used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a post on Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnicity-related conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s leadership, mostly of white and men-only, and concluded his post with the hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that their one-sided staff doesn't have colored people, so they can make decisions like this, or then they have colored employees, but their position isn't that they dare to tell their opinion as a straight and easy-to-use Z."
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely left the claim unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups and promote engagement within the company.
Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK.”
According to a congressional expert group, military officials distorted intelligence about the Fathers.
On Thursday, a panel of congressional experts published a report that said U.S. military officials under the command of Central Command changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic view of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what happened on the ground.
The Republican chairpersons of the House Armed Services Committee, the subcommittee responsible for intelligence and defence funding, set up a working group in which the interim report outlines a report on the "general satisfaction" of the intelligence analysts of the Armed Forces.
Central Command, or Centcom, is a U.S. military headquarters located in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of Centcom gave a generally more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions than what the facts on the ground showed, and were, without exception, more positive than what was reported in the intelligence services in the analysis of other units of the intelligence community.”
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers are suffering when false analysis is presented to high-level political decision makers,” said Ken Calvert, a California Republican representative.
"Centcom's leadership flaws reach the highest level of the organization."
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems that emerged in 2014 and 2015, including the descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi forces by Central Command.
While the report does not contain decisive evidence that reports ordered by the Obama administration would have been forged, it gives analysts a glimpse that Centcom leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements, and congressional statements were significantly more positive than the actual events,” the report said.
“For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a large military pension to recapture Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.”
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
“After months of research, this is very clear,” said Mike Pompeo, a Republican representative from Kansas.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. intelligence chiefs at the top of the U.S. military manipulated the intelligence results obtained to mitigate the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after learning of the suspicions posed by analysts that inquiries about the Fathers would have been manipulated.
The report, which was published on Thursday, will follow up with more detailed results as investigations continue.
In addition, the Department of Defense inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican working group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restrictive process for evaluating intelligence on ISIS and the Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s senior Democratic representative.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of the intelligence results, "violates the morale of analysts" and "takes into account insufficiently divergent views".
According to Schiff and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions "to a predetermined or political official line".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by a Pentagon reviewer that was initiated following allegations made by analysts at Centcom.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector’s investigation was underway.
However, he says: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues.”
The investigation has other follow-up consequences, in addition to trying to find out whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by more and more defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year could question how much President Obama can trust the Central Command and that it will give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence on fathers corresponds to disagreements that arose more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that stated that President George W. Bush’s government, despite many analysts’ disapproval of the year’s simplification of the government, was in favour of the country.
Hooker also played a key role in the Isis intelligence insurgency.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Working Group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, the strikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the market.
However, the results of the study were not transferred outside of Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom’s then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after many lawmakers had judged that the testimonies given to the Senate were too positive about the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander-in-Chief of the Central Command.
The United States wins fourth doubles in women’s field hockey and establishes its position in midfield with Britain
After scoring three goals in a 6–1 away game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam wasn’t sure if he had done the same thing before.
“I have no idea,” he says.
"I'm not one of those people who likes to count the paintings they make."
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and are sharing the first place in their group with Britain, who continued their winning streak on Thursday when Japan won 2-0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams survived the finals, which decides which of the six teams will be the first in a block and which will be the second.
The first placer avoids a long-term confrontation with a hard-held Dutch team that won the second block.
Despite Saturday’s gameplay, the Americans have already raised a lot of their surprising success in these races, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
Growing up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, he first took up field hockey when he was only 3 years old (his older twin sisters were playing in Drexel). He joined the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player of all time.
The 2008 Olympic Games missed him when he failed to make it to the final list of games.
After that came the 2012 races, where he and his team had hardly seen success.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as coach, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, mental, and physical,” says Bam.
"Our desire for work in London was not what it is now.
We’ve made a complete turn.”
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal in the first half by hitting the ball with a sliding in.
India had come into the game with no tournament wins, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept the situation 1–0 until the third period when Bam stepped into the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, smashed into the middle, hit the ball goal and thus took the Americans 2–0 in the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored her last goal in the middle of the fourth season.
The game was the first of the tournament in which U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the Americans scored one hit each.
Briggs is now living his era of success.
Just like Bam.
“Our investment is good now,” Parnham says, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the middle of the Olympics, a trampoline brings zen
No matter the time and place, you will inevitably compete in the Olympics.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to be the next exciting message constantly and everywhere.
It’s as if the Olympic fire itself is a flashing messaging flare that moves from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t turn on television, read newspapers, or listen to your neighbor’s conversations in the café line without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
First-time Olympian Dooley charms with a smile and might well have a name on everyone’s lips that would appear and belong to the best time of viewing and listening, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good-mind TV commercials, if only he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for the Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic torch does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Far from the center, partly in the shadows are lesser-known sports, such as air pistol shooting, archery, slingshots, and taekwondo.
We will always have breastfeeding, and the championship will stay with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I'd like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never reached the medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side, the medals are edged by the Canadians.
China’s Dong Dong and Canada’s Rosie MacLenna are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of the downtrodden, in part because of its uncivilized ear, it sounds more suitable for the circus than for the Olympics.
(In this context, I acknowledge that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species has a comedy potential, which has been used in cartoons for the endless bombardment of characters. But it also has the same value as in gymnastics and swimming, i.e. the species that essentially combine in a trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means "floating board".
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline, which will sink them to an altitude of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as spins, tricks and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged based on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the Trampoline Championship, of which 16 are men and 16 are women.
The most common olympic genres are straight forward.
In reaching gold, the medalists must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal, which they aim for in the televised press, namely the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is lofty, admirable, even fanatical – and enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just to watch the races.
This trampoline offers a breathtaking break.
In the trampoline, the direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and sniffs back up effortlessly.
Of course, there is also the competitive aspect of the species, and it is not easy, but it does not involve a passionate sprint to the goal or a leap forward, only a sleepy and lubricating combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympics can get.
The women’s races and finals will be held on Friday afternoons and will start at 13.00 local time and the men’s races will be held on Saturday at the same time.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 2 p.m. local time each day.
In the middle of the Olympic mania they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might be overlooked in the middle of the general crowd.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering attractive men’s athletes and objectifying them – as recently suggested by the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for a terrifying new crowd of fans.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, which is a long-term ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcibly dispersed demonstrations demanding political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several demonstrators have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia deteriorating?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests, which are spreading to increasingly wider regions.
Just last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
Eyewitnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
The video of the demonstrations supposedly at the end of last year or early this year shows how security forces are hitting young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping the country together has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the International Crisis Research Group at the African Sarvi Project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second-largest country in Africa, with Western countries contributing to its stability.
The U.S. military and the intelligence service support Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new mainstay.
The streets of cities are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model of democracy: human rights organisations have been constantly reporting on the government's repression policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissenters are quickly being mitigated.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are repressed, and they have no choice but to show their mind, it will erupt,” says Seyoum Teshome, a professor at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“The whole youth shows their mind.
A whole generation is protesting.”
There are many topics for dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to the government coalition’s dissatisfaction with power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies even gained the last place they previously belonged to the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are mounting on the border with Eritrea, where the escalating situation claimed hundreds of deaths in the fighting in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less overthrown separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People’s Liberation Front, may seek to exploit mixed-up and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons for why the depressed mood that has been under the surface for years is now eroding.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and internet access improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many people access the Internet through intermediation servers that hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to the demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest population groups, the Oromo and the Amharo.
Oroms and Amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharas, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country’s politics and business and have exploited the oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in sub-regions.
But this is also changing.
“The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest protests have been in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many Amharas and Oromans feel that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by a tiger tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unspecified illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between the opposing parties.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles’ shoes for almost unknown reasons.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the tiger-managed security forces.
Many people are afraid that this will mean more bleeding.
The last time similar riots were experienced in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which the government, analysts say, first smuggled and then stole.
In the post-election riots, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the preceding months, and the riots ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure design, such as the new mainstay, and for their significant progress in combating poverty.
But internal resentment towards the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from intensifying.
And revenge is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked tiger-owned businesses, and anti-tiger hate speech is on the rise on social media.
According to analysts, the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a state of trouble.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for uninhabited, neighbouring Somalia surveillance aircraft, but the base has been recently closed, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable allies to collapse.
“This requires a strict balance,” says Abdi.
Donald Trump Says He Was Sarcastic in Claiming Obama to Be the Founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to retract his words in his latest campaign dispute by claiming that he was not serious in claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions on the Republican side about the candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
It is also an embarrassing situation for his supporters, who must try to defend his candidacy in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at an election rally on Wednesday and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
On Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump made a full remark on his tweet the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was quite serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest storm of criticism rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on the topic.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton’s speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm.
At the end of July she received widespread criticism when she appeared to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later she explained her comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump extends the limits of political speech and withdraws his words if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that will trigger a response from his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to the messages, and then “clears up” in one way or another, depending on the reactions,” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has also observed both.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through different seams."
Instead of Trump softening his statements to the electorate, he has changed his style even more in recent days as his numbers of supporters have continued to fall.
A new poll published Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist said Trump’s support is significantly smaller than Clinton’s in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is tightly egalitarian.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative words, he often accuses critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But having been increasingly targeted in his presidential campaign in recent months, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in a pesky position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments, however provocative they may be.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think his words are justified, as a political speech,” Giuliani replied, when asked if Trump was truthful in his assertion of the founding of Isis by Obama and Hillary Clinton.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which Obama completely mistakenly called a ‘lower-ranking team’, and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue acting when it did not deal with the situation in the Middle East with determination.
Before Friday’s election campaign in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of abusing his speeches and discriminatory attitudes toward him.
He ridiculed "unworthy and pitiful" television commentators who tried to get ahold of him, but said he could not succeed in doing so.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s explanation, saying it only made it more clear that he was not fit for president.
Coffee shop closed due to unfair rent increase opens in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a bit of a rotten café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the café had to be priced out of its street corner on Bedford Avenue when rents became disproportionate.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cup-shaped soaps.
Locals consider this under-middle-classification to avoid the loss of a coffee shop.
Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club is gone, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and there you can pay with a credit card, but some employees are the same and the atmosphere is still intact.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verbi in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new, too.
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches and capricious and browned onion rings as a complement.
The list also includes dark chocolates.
The coffee shop no longer produces beer, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After being held in a cafe for nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed that the old standard customers are beginning to visit Verbi with a steady flow.
“A lot of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One of those is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited Verbi regularly.
After moving to Greenpoint, he went on a walk to Verbi in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized I liked Verb’s coffee and culture,” he says.
Now he is drinking coffee again, although on that Sunday he took his usual iced coffee instead of the chai tea mix, which is also a top note.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been loyal to Verbi since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and ordered the same thing without exception.
“I walked into the cafeteria every day for more than seven hours, like a machine, and there they already made my voibage with all the fillings,” he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products from his menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders its standard product, but from time to time she alternates her bagels with bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says you shouldn't be upset that the soap shop took the old place.
Soap Cherie owners even offered to make a special soap, which is made using Verbi’s own cold-sweetened coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
Also, the traditional Polish people who lived in Greenpoint have welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought with it other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the café’s cold-smelted coffee.
The café can also be extended to the adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough that they get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I lost the smell of coffee."
The Big Duck in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room in the White House.
Known as a culinary artist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxury dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as hen liver pasta and Maryland turtle milk.
On that day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in a tomato sauce, potato chips, and a dessert of plum poppies.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans how they should eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, both work as food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is Harper's A Square Meal, which will be published on Tuesday, describing the history of American food as a great hamburger of the 1930s.
The couple showed their culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with the reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the big stock market crash occurred, in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, in turn, turkey, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the carnivore, the couple said it was suitable for the discussion about eating a very large hamburger.
“The carrots were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut butter, liver butter and bean butter.
They were made from materials that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they’re enough for the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe is irritating.
"It's got to press on your stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great lama years, the American dining table especially in the countryside acted on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
The women made food for the agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the cakes were served.
It was the Americans who had sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when suddenly they were forced to give up their abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, mystical dishes such as carrots and dumplings became the main diet, and dumplings were said to be "a great way to exploit the food stars" because chefs could cover up the chefs' not-so-attractive accompaniment.
The fresh fruit was replaced with less expensive dried fruits.
The meat, which for years had been a key part of the American meal, became a luxury that was economically used.
We tried strange mixtures, where the most important thing was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values and not so much taste or even a healthy sense of cooking.
While doing research for the book, which also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman made potato beans filled with peanut butter as a dish of the time.
"It didn't get popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, who
Ziegelman added: “It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion do not match at all.
This was typical of many household recipes.”
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as the head of the Federal Household Agency in 1923–1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged women to be purposeful budget holders and to respond to the challenge of making tasty dishes like carrot-cream pages.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical pastries.
Particularly tasty are the explanations of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat the cake" attitude.
While he publicly praised his childhood for simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become him.
“He liked the mainland European cuisine, like fish and cucumbers,” says Coe.
"He almost ate in a gold-plated dining room, on top of a smoke.
He was completely alienated from the reality.”
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, the food served in the White House was not only Washington's boring, but also the poorest cooked."
Many of the food of the Lama era was abandoned as soon as the earth got back to its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple begin to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why she could not throw food away.
“He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away,” says Coe.
“People even started getting sick of his food,” remembers Ziegelman.
"For example, one of the windmills."
When the main dishes were emptied at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out a homemade snack, the same that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
“It’s called plum foam,” says Ziegelman, adding that giving an apparent name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We unwittingly dipped our spoons in a thick brown pan.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe lied a second time and a third time.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Gilead's full compensation for attorney's fees for patent infringement of hepatitis C drug with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for the attorney’s fees incurred by it over a patent dispute with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from damages of $200 million for breaching two patents held by Merck in connection with Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni successful drugs. A U.S. judge noted that the breaches were committed by Merck and others were found to be false.
In a lawsuit filed on Thursday, U.S. District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to a waiver of attorneys' fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with the next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat the vast 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other in court and demanded private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed forces have captured the city of Manbij from Isis
U.S.-backed forces have taken control of the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border, in northern Syria, when the last extremist group of ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesperson said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now raiding the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the SDF’s Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
“The city is now completely in our hands, but we are still conducting search operations,” Darwish said.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, revealing that her and her husband's income at the time was $10.75 million and the real federal tax rate they paid was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech awards, and as Foreign Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton announced that she had earned $3 million from her charities.
Clinton’s Vice Presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton released the 10-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for economic transparency,” Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind the excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax information.
As usual, U.S. presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax information, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration’s audit and say it is the reason why Trump has not disclosed his income data.
"The transfer is yours," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax details.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not let Trump disclose his tax information until the checks are complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his contributions to charities as well as his ties to charity, his many business relationships.
Clinton has taken on this issue and posted a video online on Friday, in which he highlights prominent Republicans who are urging Trump to release his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on economics in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not make his tax returns public,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to the Politico magazine, Trump paid no taxes at all or paid just a little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted several taxpayers and accountants as saying that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rate has risen as a key issue in the presidential election.
According to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Clinton has backed a bill that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
In a Clinton election held in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, headquartered in Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffett says he, too, has been subject to a tax audit and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was wage earnings.
Their main investment was a low-income index investment fund, and the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili-powder-filled condominiums to protect elephants in Tanzania
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation – elephants are sprayed by throwing chili powder-filled condoms at them.
The tool has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign with the U.S. Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers in the villages of Northern Tanzania how to protect their homes.
Some time ago, spiders were used to quell elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After we developed the method, we have seen attitudes in these villages change, as now villagers can rely on being able to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," Honeyguide Foundation CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
First, the intruding elephant is harassed by pointing the flashlight and playing the peg.
If this does not work, the so-called chili cloud is thrown.
The ground chili powder is put into the condom together with the sparkle, after which the end of the condom is screwed so that only the ignition yarn is left out.
When the ignition wire is ignited, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last means is a thrower that fires into the air of a firefighter known as a Roman candle and generates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticises Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s reference number from Arab “invitation” – RT News
A French, very Jewish film director gave birth after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not mention Israel's address number in its country number list, a hotel employee appealing to Arab customers for "invitations".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Shoah document, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s list of reference numbers.
However, it is not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel via a separate call center.
The filmmaker asked for an explanation about the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist’s response shocked him.
The receptionist said the removal of Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the action shocked the filmmaker even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our visitors are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's routing number."
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, the German ambassador to Israel, called the case “a great disgrace.”
“It shocks and shocks all of us.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we consider that we are in Germany and this is exactly what this hotel chain is all about.
There is no need for further explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” says the ambassador.
The incident triggered quite a counter-reaction on the web, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving up on the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Wake up" was said in a series of publications highlighting the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes that he quickly denied the hotel's accusations, called it a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
“A direct order to exclude Israel from the list of address numbers was never issued,” a representative for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel said in a statement.
It adds that the reference number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bands in Brazilian students' protests
The students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate their minds against the government’s reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bands against the protesters.
The crackdown began when law enforcement authorities tried to disperse a group of students, as a result of which the police used rubber bands and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration who wanted to show their outrage at the government’s plans.
The governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a austerity measure to close nearly one hundred public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffiti on the walls, protesting against Michel Temer, the president's office.
The student protest took place just days after the streets filled with demonstrators in favor of President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted on the charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Levan Dzhagaryan, the Russian ambassador to Iran.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran.
“Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new ones are ready to enter the market.
The continued growth of trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between the countries,” Dzhagaryan said.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, rising to $856 million.
“In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“Last year, the Russian Foreign Office in Iran granted about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries whose citizens traveled in Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, in turn, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Scotland's Callum Skinner tosses a goal for the British to win a cycling gold medal
Scotland’s Callum Skinner contested the men’s team at Rio’s Velodrome last night when the British three defended the 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow, Skinner, was in the role of an anchor, which he inherited from his Scottish compatriot Sir Chris Hoyle. The youngster made the legend proud by scoring the goal and taking the victory from the New Zealand team considered to be the favourites.
Britain took the surprise victory four years ago, when Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic goals.
And they repeated the trick after only being placed for six at the World Cycling Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since given up his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was to replace Jamie Staff, who specialised in the role of the first lead.
Hindes came out just at the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the competition also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man who the British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic timeline, but New Zealand was faster in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the doubles.
Hindes was exactly behind after his lap, but Kenny struggled to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
Much of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes was driving to slow down the pace at a higher speed, which enabled Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep the pace.
Hoy followed from his place as a BBC commentator and reached out to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the awards rink.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow, Skinner, says: “I’m disgusted by the equation.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to accidentally falling onto the track due to a bad start.
He later rescinded his words, and the British rivals had no appeal.
This time there was no such problem with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says: “The tunnel was like in London, all the British flags were flying in the mirror.
Our team has been unified in the last three months.
We’ve lost so many World Championships that winning the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of ten race championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress made in the last five months, five successful days ahead with velodrome.
As Kenny has shown in his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's achievements and winning three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
This would mean accumulating the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born also on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
In this case, the medals would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny is next to compete in the sprint, which starts today and solves in three days.
Boltonian 28-year-old Kenny says, “At the moment, I can only rejoice about this.
Team racing is always the best.
You will enjoy the victory with your friends.
“Winning alone is a little lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get the knight's value."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest four-man team-leading riders.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42) will be contested on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He had a fight with the contestants yesterday before the timeline, when the editors invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngawie reached a world record time of 4:13.260.
The UK team can now be confident that its great cycling team will take responsibility for the mid-stage of the Olympics and bring a host of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas, the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and harassment, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the first night of velodrome competitions shows that Britain’s already legendary reputation to rise to the top at the perfect moment is once again being realized.
The future of Portland smelting plant on the balance due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminum smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are on the brink when the power company supplying the smelting plant said that one of the plant owners is dismantling the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue the aid for the operation of the plant.
Fixed, 20-year support will cease in November.
The Alcoa Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of terminations.
The snowball effect can continue to increase, as the smelting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, resulting in the closure of the power plant in England last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelter loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to speculations about the future of the plant, which have been used for years, initially caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the factory's production price.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum insulation plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other owners of the insulation plant to also terminate their contract.
The majority ownership of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holding minority stakes in the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that physical electricity demand from the smelting plant will continue.
AGL states that the agreements are so-called safeguard agreements, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The term of termination of contracts is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in the 2017 financial year,” says the power plant.
The potential return on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards is currently limited by strong market outlooks for electricity wholesale market prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts by $187 million in its accounting “as an advance for the termination of the contracts.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the smelting plant running or to secure the electricity supply to the smelting plant".
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been careful in their assessment of both the smelting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In a speech last week, Stephen Mikkelsen, chief operating officer of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it means a significant drop in demand in the (electric) market.
As a producer, that would not be good news for us,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian TV star Kendall as cover girl of Vogue in September
A model from the Kardashian-Jenner clan and her mother and manager Kris’ fourth daughter, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder and appeared in fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Looking at the blanket in a room full of my loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The publication of the canvas was followed by a bizarre (or perhaps just following the Kardashian style?), a scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (Bar Disorders Rob and Caitlyn and everyone else’s favorite person in the video series, the producer of the Kardashian series, Ryan Seac.
The plot is clichéd, and it is used for almost all birthdays of the cast shows (Seacrest says the words: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" just as frankly as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Krisin had to somehow get her other daughters involved in this audience.
For the appearance in the September issue of Vogue signifies an undeniably new era of Kardashian.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been on Vogue's case before (she appeared on Vogue's cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is of its own class.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling publication of the year.
More of a large picture book than a fashion magazine-like number attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion website from Fashion reported that last year’s 832-page tutorial had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September issue star is so eagerly awaited that in the previous two years the photos of the magazine have leaked to the public already before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more celebrities working on the cover than models that are celebrities.
Oscar-winner and Dior face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later she was honored with Lady Gaga.
The magazine portrays Jenner as the success model of his generation, and even if he was one of the model’s celebrities, he’s still quite well-received.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, real TV stars or modern-day kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who are more successful in the entertainment industry than others.
Last year, Beyoncé has one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Because of his true TV background, Jenner’s role in the fashion world will always be a burden.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid for calling them "naked".
These feelings have resurfaced as the news of Jenner’s appearance on Vogue’s cover came to light.
However, the continued withdrawal of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
She and all of her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she performs on real TV, perhaps just as a way to meet her sister and her children.
Legal aid centers turn off 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people in countries are deported from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that additional cuts will already have on centres already at the frontiers.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five people seeking legal aid and legal services are already being turned away – most of them are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified marriages and similar human resources injustices.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, judiciary centres are at risk of losing another 30 percent more of federal funding.
According to the latest computational report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, the head of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Center, James Farrell, says thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government doesn't reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away when they seek the necessary services they need,” Farrell says.
“People who are out of violent relationships, people who are under an unmanageable and crippling debt line, families who are separating, workers who are unjustifiably fired – all of them have problems with legal affairs, and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of Queensland’s most vulnerable will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national mid-level.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump’s campaign is being prosecuted for threatening an employee with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for allegedly failing to take any action after his leadership was told that the campaign’s North Carolina leader had threatened a worker with a gun while driving a Jeep in February.
The event is described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be addressed internally before he realized, in his own words, that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his complaint that campaign manager Earl Phillip "raised the pistol, put his right forearm on the vest, and pressed the pipe on Vincent's knee."
Following a complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini was informed that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Even if the gun did not fire, it would cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee provoked public outrage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that “the supporters of the second additional plea” – who are considered gun owners and gunmen – could take action if the Cli’s nominee could bring him to the Hill.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his words from the context and Trump said he did not encourage violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for indifference and compensation from Phillip for over-harm, abuse and the mental suffering caused by them.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking for comment.
Phillip was not reached despite his efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB said Phillip had just left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to a call from Phillip’s consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has launched a controversial campaign.
Justice Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow.
Heathrow also revitalizes the economy and creates well-being – not just in local communities and in London, but across the country.
For me, this was the factor that was of the greatest interest in Heathrow, and as at the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympians brought huge profits to Stratford and East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I have heard that Britain will never be ready for them, and that we will face a disturbing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
Overcoming obstacles will always be met, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and grow the economy by <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, bringing expertise and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
At Heathrow, we have an amazing team that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, which included the T5 terminal – voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 railroad to the world’s two-seater terminal.
Now they are ready for the production of the third runway, supported by a private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can secure our trade for the future and create the skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow and a former Secretary of Commerce at the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising in cat-mouse games
Efforts by companies that earn their money from online advertising to mislead ad-resistance software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company producing blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad-resistance programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will change the ad labeling codes of its desktop site so that ad-resistance programs will have a harder time identifying which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock says it has discovered the new codes.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “such a balloting between the open-source advertising community and the deceptives has been ongoing since the ad campaign was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own corrections again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the level of concern advertisers have formed in the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad blocking programs, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users every day on mobile devices, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading ad-resistance programs in its desktop application, as the spokesperson says the anti-mobile ads programs do not work in Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
Revenues from desktop ads are still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the effort to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update the user settings ad tool so that users can have more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticised Adblock’s new filters, saying they would also block the appearance of some of its regular Facebook posts.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we’re going to solve the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
“Advertising programs are cumbersome and ineffective, and that’s why we’ve instead invested in developing user settings like ad tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves.”
Woman commits suicide by leaving her car behind on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking eyewitnesses for help on the highway in the first hours of Thursday’s accident in which a woman deliberately left her under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperation by lying down on a dark road and was hit by several cars, according to the Vaud police.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her goal was clearly to commit suicide, including a truck among the overrun cars.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified. The police are asking them or other witnesses to register.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve that a criminal investigation had been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges against the drivers involved in the accident are raised.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to find out,” Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases on the basis of which drivers are not held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that drivers could not wait to hit their pedestrians on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of a charge against him of capital punishment after he ran into a man lying on the A1 motorway near Payerne on an August night in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and turned off on the road.
The court found that the manner of the policeman responding to the emergency call was justified and the man lying on the road was “a completely exceptional and unforeseen situation.”
All road users are asked to call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 for the accident near Morges on Thursday.
NASA's climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model to study Venus’ past using the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was used to determine whether conditions on Venus may have been similar to those on Earth, although Venus is hot and waterless on the surface and its gas body is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to previous research, Venus’s slow speed of rotation is explained by its thick gas belt.
However, according to the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and yet it has been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to investigate the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% darker.
“In GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its daytime half is almost two months per sun,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and generates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like a umbrella and protects the surface for a large part from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is up to a few degrees lower than the current temperature of the Earth.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to previous assumptions by planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
In the watery karate, only a thick carbon dioxide gas bubble and a deadly greenhouse effect remained in space – i.e., Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of a new Venus climate modeling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the club’s vice president of ice hockey, betting on the lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
Colorado Deputy CEO/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and the club’s vice president of ice hockey,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
“Over the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the VP of coaching and club hockey activities must be completely on the same lines with the organization.
He must also have the power of speech in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his commitment to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and we wish him all the best for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the Year from his first season as head coach of Avalanche in 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the drop-out games and has not been able to continue for the last two years.
Avalanche scored 39–39–4 in the 2015–16 season and remained five points away from the Minnesota Wilds while playing from another Wild Card spot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Start Negotiations and Suspend Strike
The main negotiators say that the wage barriers for oil workers in the North Sea will be suspended as all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
There have been strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group on drilling rigs operated by Royal Dutch Shell located in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, “Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT reaffirm their agreement to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute.”
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will deal with problems from fresh perspectives.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut about 9% of the tariffs for its contractors operating in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in company tariffs follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in countries in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space to move around in order to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, in turn, has stripped thousands of employees of its salaries and announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, thus aiming to increase its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with Labour Leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest job interviews that has been going on in the North Sea for an entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few,” Anderson said.
Under $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, compared to around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope’s newest mission has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades.
Based on the new data, astronomers will be able to find out why stars belonging to the same star cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbits relate to planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the star’s weight-to-age relationship and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the constellation were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching adulthood.
They're spinning faster now than ever.
When the speed of rotation is at its peak, large amounts of adult stars are released by the stellar wind.
These winds have a decelerating effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of detectable star flashes (which are similar to solar flashes).
The most recent listed rotational speed data suggest that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – larger ones rotate slower than smaller ones.
“We see from the Pleiades’ ‘dance’ that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars,” Rebull says.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars in relation to their rotational speeds.
“The Pleiades star cluster provides a support pillar for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars,” says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why the stars are slowing down their rotational speed and stopping their "dancing".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the Pleiades’ rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
