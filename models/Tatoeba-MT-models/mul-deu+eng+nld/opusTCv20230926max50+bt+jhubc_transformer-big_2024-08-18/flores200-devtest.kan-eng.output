For example, the most common style image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the size of the screen of the film at the end of the Analog Film era.
Although it is still produced today, the proportion of its shape has been derived ancillary from the digital camera's image sensors' shapes.
In fact, the 35mm shape is a little confusing, 36mm wide is 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (sharing by the dozen to get a simple total ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS series formats) are equal to or equal to the ratio of this format.

In fact, even if someone knows that it exists, it is a little difficult to find it. Once inside the cage, it gives a sense of complete segregation.
There is nothing to be seen except the happy, beautiful and the surrounding mountainous lines. A small part of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.

On the other hand, satisfying the needs of amino-acid from the available plant resources is a very difficult thing for the primate that has a digestive system as a human.
In addition, failure to do so will have serious consequences, i.e.: deprivation of growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
Plant-based protein can be easily obtained from greens and duck grains, but it can be difficult to digest and take them apart from non-fertilizing strains like ours.
In contrast, animal foods (eggs, eggs, eggs) are not easily digested, but they all provide a higher amount of protein, which contains the necessary amino acids.
After considering all the things, we don't have to be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" somewhat in the way of making chinpagi in savannah.
Sleep deprivation means that during normal sleep, it is necessary to wake up consciously and sleep for a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).

Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of the vehicle, as the behavior of the ORVA driver is not estimated to be one hundred percent.
Luckily, the driver behaves in a proportionate constant range; therefore, the traffic streams can also be represented by aggregation by stability and by aggregation in accordance with mathematics.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships will help in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
